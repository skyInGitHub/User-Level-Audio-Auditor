3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALISED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003 WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABU MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABU OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRADES
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE QUASI PEACEABLE CULTURE
3570-5696-0002 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALKERS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004 THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010 THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS
1995-1826-0002 JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON
1995-1826-0003 BETTER GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY
1995-1826-0004 MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE
1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN THERE'S NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK
1995-1826-0006 BEEN LOOKING UP TOOMS COUNTY
1995-1826-0007 FIND SOME CRESSWELLS THERE BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
1995-1826-0008 SOME OTHERS TOO BIG COTTON COUNTY
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
1995-1826-0010 AT ANY RATE I SAY GO
1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TODAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0014 COTTON SHE PAUSED
1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SIGHT
1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0019 COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR
1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LITERALLY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
1995-1826-0022 I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION
1995-1826-0023 GOOBERS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF VINES BUT UNDERGROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HARKENED
1995-1826-0025 SOME TIME YOU'LL TELL ME PLEASE WON'T YOU
1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON
1995-1836-0000 THE HON CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
1995-1836-0001 AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0002 WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN
1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS
1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CREIGHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CREIGHTON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESSWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY
1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESSWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
1995-1836-0007 BUT YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR
1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
1995-1836-0009 BUT CRESSWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS ENORMOUSLY BETWEEN RACES
1995-1836-0010 THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
1995-1836-0011 POSITIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES
1995-1836-0012 BUT WE'RE NOT ER EXACTLY WELCOMED
1995-1836-0013 MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZORA TO MISSUS GREY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER
1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND ZORA'S MUST BE RUINED
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
1995-1837-0002 AH THE SWAMP THE CRUEL SWAMP
1995-1837-0003 THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
1995-1837-0004 HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0005 SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMAN A CREATURE
1995-1837-0006 THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MISTS
1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED
1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
1995-1837-0009 THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DYKES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
1995-1837-0011 HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOLLS
1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST ZORA
1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
1995-1837-0021 THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOM ZORA LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0024 FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL ROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
1995-1837-0029 HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
2961-961-0000 SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I APPROVE
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SOLON'S WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROPIDAS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005 SOME POEMS OF SOLON WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008 BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAS PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SOLON HEARD THE STORY
2961-961-0010 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0011 THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS SOLON ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013 SOLON MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MAN
2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022 THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MAN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORD SPOKE
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WITH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002 IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLEITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES
2961-960-0016 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS
2961-960-0022 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BERGSON DIED
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKER BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAYLY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER VANES ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MATED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK
237-134493-0007 ALEXANDRA LETS YOU SLEEP LATE

237-134493-0013 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT
237-134493-0014 THEY THINK YOU'RE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORANGE HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDRA BERGSON
237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEEHIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN
237-126133-0009 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU

237-126133-0013 I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
237-126133-0016 OH NO JASPER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
237-126133-0017 THERE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
237-126133-0020 HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
237-134500-0000 FRANK READ ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRIER HE GREW
237-134500-0001 MARIE SIGHED
237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003 THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
237-134500-0004 THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER
237-134500-0005 OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MOWED
237-134500-0006 JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
237-134500-0007 WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF THEM IN HERE BEFORE
237-134500-0008 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WET SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TOO
237-134500-0009 I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASON TOO THEN
237-134500-0010 IT'S EXCITING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO GET THE GRASS CUT
237-134500-0011 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDER WEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SCYTHE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
237-134500-0013 MARIE PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014 AND EMIL MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHABATA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0016 I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW LINDENS ARE
237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THAT WAY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0019 HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
237-134500-0020 YES DON'T YOU
237-134500-0021 OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAID AND SCHOOL TEACHERY
237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
237-134500-0023 IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH CARL
237-134500-0024 I LIKE TO TALK TO CARL ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
237-134500-0025 OH EMIL
237-134500-0026 SURELY YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
237-134500-0027 MARIE'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
237-134500-0028 I'M SURE ALEXANDRA HOPES YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
237-134500-0029 I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND AND LOOK ON
237-134500-0030 I WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLE CLOTH
237-134500-0032 I GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
237-134500-0033 I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
237-134500-0034 THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
237-134500-0035 AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE CROSS TO ME
237-134500-0036 I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MARIE
237-134500-0037 BUT EMIL IF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
237-134500-0038 AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND
237-134500-0039 THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED TO
237-134500-0040 I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
237-134500-0042 THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER
121-123852-0000 THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LIBERTY COMMITS WHEN I AM SOMETIME ABSENT FROM THY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEARS FULL WELL BEFITS FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
121-123852-0001 AY ME
121-123852-0002 NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FARTHEST EARTH REMOV'D FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH SEA AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE BUT AH
121-123852-0003 THOUGHT KILLS ME THAT I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAP LARGE LENGTHS OF MILES WHEN THOU ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND WATER WROUGHT I MUST ATTEND TIME'S LEISURE WITH MY MOAN RECEIVING NOUGHT BY ELEMENTS SO SLOW BUT HEAVY TEARS BADGES OF EITHER'S WOE
121-123852-0004 MY HEART DOTH PLEAD THAT THOU IN HIM DOST LIE A CLOSET NEVER PIERC'D WITH CRYSTAL EYES BUT THE DEFENDANT DOTH THAT PLEA DENY AND SAYS IN HIM THY FAIR APPEARANCE LIES
121-123859-0000 YOU ARE MY ALL THE WORLD AND I MUST STRIVE TO KNOW MY SHAMES AND PRAISES FROM YOUR TONGUE NONE ELSE TO ME NOR I TO NONE ALIVE THAT MY STEEL'D SENSE OR CHANGES RIGHT OR WRONG
121-123859-0001 O TIS THE FIRST TIS FLATTERY IN MY SEEING AND MY GREAT MIND MOST KINGLY DRINKS IT UP MINE EYE WELL KNOWS WHAT WITH HIS GUST IS GREEING AND TO HIS PALATE DOTH PREPARE THE CUP IF IT BE POISON'D TIS THE LESSER SIN THAT MINE EYE LOVES IT AND DOTH FIRST BEGIN
121-123859-0002 BUT RECKONING TIME WHOSE MILLION'D ACCIDENTS CREEP IN TWIXT VOWS AND CHANGE DECREES OF KINGS TAN SACRED BEAUTY BLUNT THE SHARP'ST INTENTS DIVERT STRONG MINDS TO THE COURSE OF ALTERING THINGS ALAS WHY FEARING OF TIME'S TYRANNY MIGHT I NOT THEN SAY NOW I LOVE YOU BEST WHEN I WAS CERTAIN O'ER INCERTAINTY CROWNING THE PRESENT DOUBTING OF THE REST
121-123859-0003 LOVE IS A BABE THEN MIGHT I NOT SAY SO TO GIVE FULL GROWTH TO THAT WHICH STILL DOTH GROW
121-123859-0004 SO I RETURN REBUK'D TO MY CONTENT AND GAIN BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
121-127105-0000 IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
121-127105-0001 SOMEONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
121-127105-0002 CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
121-127105-0003 THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED
121-127105-0004 THE STORY'S WRITTEN
121-127105-0005 I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT
121-127105-0006 THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONEMENT BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THAT CHARMED ME
121-127105-0007 TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH THANK GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
121-127105-0008 HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S
121-127105-0009 SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
121-127105-0010 SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
121-127105-0011 SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
121-127105-0012 IT WASN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
121-127105-0013 YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
121-127105-0014 YOU ARE ACUTE
121-127105-0015 HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
121-127105-0016 PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST
121-127105-0017 IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY
121-127105-0018 CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
121-127105-0019 MISSUS GRIFFIN HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
121-127105-0020 WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITERAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEN
121-127105-0021 WON'T YOU TELL DOUGLAS
121-127105-0022 WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS
121-127105-0023 LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
121-127105-0024 POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
121-127105-0025 THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
121-127105-0026 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
121-127105-0027 HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
121-127105-0028 THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
121-127105-0029 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
121-127105-0030 I DON'T ANTICIPATE
121-127105-0031 SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
121-127105-0032 YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
121-127105-0033 IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
121-127105-0034 IT SOUNDED DULL IT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
121-127105-0035 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
121-127105-0036 BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
121-121726-0000 ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SEASON
121-121726-0001 HARANGUE THE TIRESOME PRODUCT OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
121-121726-0002 ANGOR PAIN PAINFUL TO HEAR
121-121726-0003 HAY FEVER A HEART TROUBLE CAUSED BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WIDOW
121-121726-0004 HEAVEN A GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TO
121-121726-0005 HEDGE A FENCE
121-121726-0006 HEREDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
121-121726-0007 HORSE SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BETTING ON THE RACES
121-121726-0008 HOSE MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WETTING THE WALK
121-121726-0009 HOTEL A PLACE WHERE A GUEST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DOLLARS FOR POOR QUARTERS
121-121726-0010 HOUSECLEANING A DOMESTIC UPHEAVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
121-121726-0011 HUSBAND THE NEXT THING TO A WIFE
121-121726-0012 HUSSY WOMAN AND BOND TIE
121-121726-0013 TIED TO A WOMAN
121-121726-0014 HYPOCRITE A HORSE DEALER
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
1188-133604-0001 THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIAROSCURISTS
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CHIAROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
1188-133604-0005 IT IS THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPACCIO'S ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009 NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE
1188-133604-0015 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0017 THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURIST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0023 THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0026 HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO AND THE PYTHON
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0028 WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0029 ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0030 HE KNOWS THEM BOTH
1188-133604-0031 THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
1188-133604-0032 IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BURNE JONES IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
1188-133604-0033 EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
1188-133604-0035 THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM
1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DUERER
1188-133604-0038 BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
1188-133604-0040 THE CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEAF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATERMILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
1188-133604-0042 THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE
1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF AND THE GIER EAGLE
1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT THEM
1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICE WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANT A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014 YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH
1221-135767-0015 YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
1221-135767-0019 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
1221-135767-0020 IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021 PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
1221-135767-0024 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0005 HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135766-0015 IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMALLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WARDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTHOOD ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTISE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELYTES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS ATTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW AN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUN NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELYTING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOK OF MORMON HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KIRTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLED BY HUMAN SCRIBE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALDWELL COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0017 OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOL BOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBIGENSES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS IT THE MORMONS
4077-13751-0020 AS A SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISSOURIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISSOURI WITH GOVERNOR BOGGS AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHAT GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0004 ALREADY A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRY'S NEED
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTIAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTISE BUT OF CELESTIAL MARRIAGE PLURALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 AT THE INCEPTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTISE
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PLURAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRIOR TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT MORMONS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MEET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCES OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ESCHEATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINALE HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
2300-131720-0000 THE PARIS PLANT LIKE THAT AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT
2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0003 THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
2300-131720-0007 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEEP THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012 EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014 MISTER EDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017 EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICTS OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021 THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAN I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDISONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027 EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SCEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
2300-131720-0036 THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND REWEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
2300-131720-0041 WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004 IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005 THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED
2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROERER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO
2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003 PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009 PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014 THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015 FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016 IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021 AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022 THE CLAUSE SEEMS SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026 VERSE TWO
2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0031 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE GALATIANS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038 GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040 THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041 GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057 THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058 MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059 PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063 UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0070 BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071 WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009 THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0015 DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0017 SO IT SEEMS TO ME
1580-141083-0018 NOW MISTER SOAMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
1580-141083-0022 I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025 THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOAMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031 HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0032 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0034 AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035 HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLOA WHAT'S THIS
1580-141083-0036 HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
1580-141083-0041 LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
1580-141083-0042 MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MC LAREN
1580-141083-0044 I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
1580-141083-0047 DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
1580-141083-0049 ANYONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
1580-141083-0050 I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOLMES
1580-141083-0051 ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
1580-141083-0052 OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
1580-141083-0053 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
1580-141084-0000 IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND
1580-141084-0001 HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
1580-141084-0002 THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
1580-141084-0003 NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCHRIST'S DOOR
1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0005 THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES
1580-141084-0006 YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION
1580-141084-0007 TO MORROW IS THE EXAMINATION
1580-141084-0008 I CANNOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
1580-141084-0009 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0010 I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BYE
1580-141084-0011 WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
1580-141084-0012 THE FOUL MOUTHED FELLOW AT THE TOP
1580-141084-0013 HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD
1580-141084-0014 WHY BANNISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
1580-141084-0015 HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
1580-141084-0017 NO GOOD MY DEAR WATSON
1580-141084-0018 I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION
1580-141084-0019 YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
1580-141084-0020 LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
1580-141084-0021 ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK DOUGHY CLAY
1580-141084-0022 AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING
1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
1580-141084-0025 YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
1580-141084-0026 IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL
1580-141084-0027 NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
1580-141084-0028 THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
1580-141084-0030 JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCHRIST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
1580-141084-0032 FOR A MOMENT GILCHRIST WITH UPRAISED HAND TRIED TO CONTROL HIS WRITHING FEATURES
1580-141084-0033 COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL
1580-141084-0034 WELL WELL DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE
1580-141084-0035 HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS IN HIS OWN OFFICE
1580-141084-0036 THE INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
1580-141084-0037 WHEN I APPROACHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
1580-141084-0038 NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS
1580-141084-0043 HE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
1580-141084-0044 GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN
1580-141084-0045 SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE
1580-141084-0046 HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GILCHRIST
1580-141084-0047 I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SOAMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
1580-141084-0048 IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
1580-141084-0050 IF MISTER SOAMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
4446-2273-0000 HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
4446-2273-0001 THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM IN CHELSEA AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HILDA
4446-2273-0002 LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
4446-2273-0003 WHEN BARTLEY ARRIVED AT BEDFORD SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIE THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UPSTAIRS
4446-2273-0004 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKERY
4446-2273-0005 I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS
4446-2273-0006 THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLA D'ESTE YOU SEE
4446-2273-0007 THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY LOYAL EVEN MAINHALL
4446-2273-0008 I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDING POOR COUSIN MIKE OVER BAD SEASONS
4446-2273-0009 IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHER'S
4446-2273-0010 THERE WAS WATERCRESS SOUP AND SOLE AND A DELIGHTFUL OMELETTE STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS AND TRUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ARTICHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW RHONE WINE OF WHICH BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
4446-2273-0011 THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT LOOKS SO JOLLY
4446-2273-0012 THANK YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE IT SO WELL AS THIS
4446-2273-0013 HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARIS MUCH THESE LATE YEARS
4446-2273-0014 THERE ARE FEW CHANGES IN THE OLD QUARTER
4446-2273-0015 DON'T I THOUGH I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR IT HOW DID HER SON TURN OUT
4446-2273-0016 HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BAINS DE MER
4446-2273-0017 HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HILDA
4446-2273-0018 DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST WALK WE TOOK TOGETHER IN PARIS
4446-2273-0019 COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SMOKE
4446-2273-0020 I THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED DEMURELY
4446-2273-0021 WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANCS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0022 THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
4446-2273-0024 BARTLEY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THAT
4446-2273-0025 IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEE
4446-2273-0026 HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY NEW PLAY
4446-2273-0027 WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF A REVERIE
4446-2273-0028 NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SING EXCEPT THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME
4446-2273-0029 IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SING DON'T YOU FEEL IT
4446-2273-0030 ALEXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER
4446-2273-0031 THERE JUST IN FRONT
4446-2273-0032 HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
4446-2273-0033 FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BARTLEY SPOKE
4446-2273-0034 HE FELT A TREMOR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
4446-2273-0035 BARTLEY LEANED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
4446-2273-0036 ALEXANDER UNCLENCHED THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES
4446-2275-0000 THE STOP AT QUEENSTOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSEY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
4446-2275-0001 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UNBUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM
4446-2275-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
4446-2275-0004 ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN
4446-2275-0005 I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP
4446-2275-0006 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER KATE OR COUSIN MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG
4446-2275-0007 SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2275-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
4446-2275-0009 I GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO
4446-2275-0010 ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE
4446-2275-0011 BARTLEY BENT LOWER OVER THE FIRE
4446-2275-0012 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
4446-2275-0013 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
4446-2275-0014 I CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU MISERABLE
4446-2275-0015 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
4446-2275-0016 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES IT
4446-2275-0017 BUT IT'S WORSE NOW IT'S UNBEARABLE
4446-2275-0018 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
4446-2275-0019 THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE
4446-2275-0020 IT WAS MYSELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA
4446-2275-0021 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
4446-2275-0022 BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER
4446-2275-0023 ALEXANDER GROANED I MEANT TO BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T
4446-2275-0024 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE
4446-2275-0025 WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
4446-2275-0026 SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
4446-2275-0027 HE MOVED UNEASILY AND HIS CHAIR CREAKED
4446-2275-0028 YES YES SHE HURRIED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM
4446-2275-0029 PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING BARTLEY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY
4446-2275-0030 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
4446-2275-0031 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
4446-2275-0032 BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW
4446-2275-0033 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG
4446-2275-0034 KEEP AWAY IF YOU WISH WHEN HAVE I EVER FOLLOWED YOU
4446-2275-0035 ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY YES I KNOW I'M COWARDLY
4446-2275-0036 HE TOOK HER ROUGHLY IN HIS ARMS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
4446-2275-0037 OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
4446-2275-0038 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
4446-2275-0039 I MUST KNOW ABOUT YOU
4446-2275-0040 THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLEY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
4446-2275-0041 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
4446-2275-0042 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
4446-2275-0043 BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES
4446-2275-0044 DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
4446-2275-0045 WE'VE TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT
4446-2271-0000 MAINHALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0002 IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TOO
4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW
4446-2271-0008 IRENE BURGOYNE ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0009 MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWNE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
4446-2271-0012 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
4446-2271-0013 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE A BIT CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
4446-2271-0014 WESTMERE AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
4446-2271-0019 AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO
4446-2271-0022 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
4446-2271-0023 AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY YOUNG
4446-2271-0024 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW
1284-134647-0000 THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED INVIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONATISTS
1284-134647-0007 PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONATISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN NUMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD
1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
1284-1180-0010 UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
1284-1180-0012 WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
1284-1180-0013 AND YOU MUST BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014 OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015 WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0016 THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0027 YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1284-1181-0000 OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001 MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
1284-1181-0005 NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013 OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017 THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019 I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOU'RE GETTING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
1320-122612-0007 CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014 THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALLUVION
1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKEYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BALAAM'S ASS TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0003 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIOUS HAWKEYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005 THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
1320-122617-0006 CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED HAWKEYE UNCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0008 THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011 THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0012 FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS IN AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED CONJURER TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015 BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HINT HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSED OF COOKERY
1320-122617-0019 UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHES
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THIS SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0022 THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIP THE DEER
1320-122617-0023 UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024 BUT HAWKEYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025 SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0026 WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0028 MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
1320-122617-0029 IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON COMPOSSER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0030 SO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TARRY HERE
1320-122617-0031 BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
1320-122617-0032 KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
1320-122617-0033 IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
1320-122617-0034 HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
1320-122617-0035 THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SCENT IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS AND THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038 WILL THE HURONS HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039 THE MOHICAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLACE
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND A LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009 FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREDDLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SURFACES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHITTAWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0016 SPINNING INDEED
2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWSNESS
2094-142345-0018 WHO TAUGHT YOU TO SCRUB A FLOOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
2094-142345-0019 COMB THE WOOL FOR THE WHITTAWS INDEED
2094-142345-0020 THAT'S WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE DOING IS IT
2094-142345-0021 THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU THAT'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONGS TO RUIN
2094-142345-0022 MISTER OTTLEY'S INDEED
2094-142345-0023 YOU'RE A RARE UN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER IT'S TIME TO PUT BY
2094-142345-0024 MUNNY MY IRON'S TWITE TOLD PEASE PUT IT DOWN TO WARM
2094-142345-0025 COLD IS IT MY DARLING BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE
2094-142345-0026 SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONING THINGS AWAY
2094-142345-0027 MUNNY I TOULD IKE TO DO INTO DE BARN TO TOMMY TO SEE DE WHITTAWD
2094-142345-0028 NO NO NO TOTTY UD GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
2094-142345-0030 TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT RACHEL
2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I'VE GOT LOTS O SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWELLING AS ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0035 BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AUNT SAID DINAH
2094-142345-0036 NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I'VE DONE
2094-142345-0040 I DIDN'T PREACH WITHOUT DIRECTION
2094-142345-0041 DIRECTION
2094-142345-0042 I HANNA COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0044 SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
2094-142345-0045 OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0046 I DELIGHT IN YOUR KITCHEN
2094-142345-0047 POYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS HE
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSETER TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL
2094-142345-0050 BUT THERE'S FATHER THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0053 FOR IF HE'S ANYWHERE ON THE FARM WE CAN SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE
2094-142345-0054 OH SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
2094-142345-0055 BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO SIR
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0058 BY THE BY I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MISSUS POYSER
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0060 OH I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S IN CAPITAL ORDER
260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT
260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT
260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006 WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THIS SEA A POND AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010 SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW WEATHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS
260-123286-0012 BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO FEAR
260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014 TRULY THIS SEA IS OF INFINITE WIDTH
260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP
260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0020 TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
260-123286-0021 DURING HIS WATCH I SLEPT
260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWOKE ME
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PROFESSOR
260-123286-0025 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COAL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICHTHYOSAURUS AND THE PLESIOSAURUS DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOOL EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031 AS FOR THE ICHTHYOSAURUS HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN
260-123288-0000 THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THAT TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SALINE WATERS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE THROUGH THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH HAS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MIST WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GREY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SURCHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008 THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009 THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMBENT SAINT ELMO'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012 THAT WILL BE SAFEST NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONDENSE INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MISTS ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0014 HANS STIRS NOT
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016 I REFER TO THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED THIS DENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019 AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
260-123288-0020 EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
260-123288-0022 THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023 HE NODS HIS CONSENT
260-123288-0024 THE FIREBALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0028 WE SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
260-123440-0000 AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001 POOR ALICE
260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
260-123440-0003 OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006 I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008 I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RATE
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEAR
260-123440-0013 I AM SO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014 AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS
260-123440-0015 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS
260-123440-0017 THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE O MOUSE
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001 WHY ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002 WHY ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004 WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGION
3575-170457-0005 SHE A TORY AND CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DISSENT AND RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONOURED
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SOUTHEY
3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
3575-170457-0014 TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY
3575-170457-0015 BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
3575-170457-0016 FAREWELL MADAM

3575-170457-0032 COME COME I AM GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE
3575-170457-0033 SATURDAY AFTER SATURDAY COMES ROUND AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT MISS E IS COME OH DEAR
3575-170457-0034 IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3575-170457-0035 I WISH IT WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOTBED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038 AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED UP MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT IT MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST'S SHOP IN HAWORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRESS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBY'S FRACTURED LEG
3575-170457-0047 TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE'S STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOUR FATTENED SAUCE
1089-134686-0001 STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHELS
1089-134686-0003 HELLO BERTIE ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND
1089-134686-0004 NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HUSBAND
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLEY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOUR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW ENNIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SODALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0013 IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER KNIGHT
1089-134686-0014 HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DEDALUS
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HERON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMAN IN GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BEATITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BEATITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATECHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM
1089-134686-0027 HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS
1089-134686-0030 BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER
1089-134686-0032 HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER
1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS
1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER
1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW
1089-134691-0000 HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0003 THE UNIVERSITY
1089-134691-0004 PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
1089-134691-0008 THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEY
1089-134691-0010 BROTHER MAC ARDLE BROTHER KEOGH
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN A CHORD
1089-134691-0015 WORDS WAS IT THEIR COLOURS
1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYED AND WOODBEGIRT AND CITADELLED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES
1089-134691-0018 AGAIN AGAIN
1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING
1089-134691-0020 HELLO STEPHANOS HERE COMES THE DEDALUS
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSEPLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WET LUSTRE
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
1089-134691-0024 STEPHANOS DEDALOS
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZEWRAPPED CITY
4507-16021-0000 CHAPTER ONE ORIGIN
4507-16021-0001 IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PEGRE FOR WHICH READ THEFT AND A HELL LA PEGRENNE FOR WHICH READ HUNGER
4507-16021-0002 THUS IDLENESS IS THE MOTHER
4507-16021-0003 SHE HAS A SON THEFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER
4507-16021-0004 WHAT IS SLANG
4507-16021-0005 WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF OBJECTIONS
4507-16021-0006 SLANG IS ODIOUS
4507-16021-0007 SLANG MAKES ONE SHUDDER
4507-16021-0008 WHO DENIES THAT OF COURSE IT DOES
4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED AND FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0012 WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG
4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN HAS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED STUDY
4507-16021-0015 SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICINE
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING
4507-16021-0019 IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP THE GUTTER THE HAIRDRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALYBACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0022 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRECIEUSES
4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0024 ALGEBRA MEDICINE BOTANY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG
4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS SLANG
4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0027 PHOENICIAN VERY GOOD
4507-16021-0028 EVEN DIALECT LET THAT PASS
4507-16021-0029 TO THIS WE REPLY IN ONE WORD ONLY
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED AND THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP AND THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO FAST AND THOSE WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICT IT
4507-16021-0033 DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAIN WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
4507-16021-0035 TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0036 FACTS FORM ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER
4507-16021-0037 THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN METAPHOR RAGS
4507-16021-0038 IN THIS GUISE IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HYDRAS TALKING
4507-16021-0041 IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK
4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSE SLANG
4507-16021-0043 THE EARTH IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A JAIL
4507-16021-0044 LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
4507-16021-0045 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
4507-16021-0046 EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GRIEF OR ITS LITTLE CARE
4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTEBRAL COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4507-16021-0048 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON
4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
4507-16021-0050 AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASS WHO ARE HAPPY
4507-16021-0051 IN THIS WORLD EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO FORTUNATE
4507-16021-0052 THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
4507-16021-0054 THAT IS WHY WE CRY EDUCATION SCIENCE
4507-16021-0055 TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE SPELLED OUT SPARKLES
4507-16021-0056 HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY JOY
4507-16021-0057 PEOPLE SUFFER IN THE LIGHT EXCESS BURNS
4507-16021-0058 THE FLAME IS THE ENEMY OF THE WING
4507-16021-0059 TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SILVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBE CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0003 MADAM CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCEVRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCEURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0005 SILVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVAUX FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO POSTERITY
3729-6852-0006 SILVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HER SELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARIVAUX AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONOURABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAUVEUR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTAIN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS THE COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SILVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SILVIA DIES
3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
3729-6852-0011 I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0012 I SHALL CALL YOU ESPRIT
3729-6852-0013 YOU DO ME A GREAT HONOUR
3729-6852-0014 HERE GO AND GET ME CHANGE FOR A LOUIS I HAVE IT SIR
3729-6852-0015 AT YOUR SERVICE SIR
3729-6852-0016 MADAME QUINSON BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR ENQUIRIES
3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIRE AT THE RATE OF ONE SOU MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO ENQUIRE MY WISHES
3729-6852-0019 I TELL HIM TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT OF THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0021 I THANK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0025 IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0026 YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYAL IS THE MOST EXACT
3729-6852-0027 THAT IS TRUE BADAUDERIE
3729-6852-0028 ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE CIVET CAT
3729-6852-0030 IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
3729-6852-0031 BUT HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VIVE LE ROI
3729-6852-0037 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
3729-6852-0038 WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AM I FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
3729-6852-0043 I RESIDE IN THE MARAIS RUE DE DOUZE PORTES
3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSATIABLE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
