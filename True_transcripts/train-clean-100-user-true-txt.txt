7067-76048-0000 I LEAVE YOU TO IT HIS ROUND FACE BETRAYED LITTLE OR NO VESTIGES OF HIS OVERNIGHT IRRITATION OUGHT YOU TO LEAVE ME TO IT SMILED SIR RICHMOND I SHALL BE INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF YOU WON'T STAY TO SEE
7067-76048-0001 NOW SIR PLEASE SAID THE GUARD RESPECTFULLY BUT FIRMLY AND DOCTOR MARTINEAU GOT IN SIR RICHMOND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS THE EXIT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO HE ASKED ALOUD TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
7067-76048-0002 SECTION TWO FOR THE BETTER PART OF FORTY HOURS SIR RICHMOND HAD EITHER BEEN TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT OR CARRYING ON IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH HER IN HER ABSENCE
7067-76048-0003 AND SHE REPEATED NO REMEMBERED COMMENTS AND PROPHETS OF HER CONTEMPORARIES ABOUT HERSELF SHE EITHER CONCEALED OR SHE HAD LOST ANY GREAT INTEREST IN HER OWN PERSONALITY
7067-76048-0004 BUT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE PEOPLE SHE HAD MET IN LIFE AND HER TALK OF THEM REFLECTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIGHT UPON HER OWN UPBRINGING AND EXPERIENCES AND HER LIKING FOR SIR RICHMOND WAS PLEASINGLY MANIFEST
7067-76048-0005 SHE LIKED HIS TURN OF THOUGHT SHE WATCHED HIM WITH A FAINT SMILE ON HER LIPS AS HE SPOKE AND SHE SPREAD HER OPINIONS BEFORE HIM CAREFULLY IN THAT SOFT VOICE OF HERS LIKE A SHY CHILD SHOWING ITS TREASURES TO SOME SUDDENLY TRUSTED AND FAVOURED VISITOR
7067-76048-0006 AS A CRISIS IN WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT YET CLEARLY KNOW WHAT INTO THIS TOPIC THEY PEERED AS INTO SOME DEEP POOL SIDE BY SIDE AND IN IT THEY SAW EACH OTHER REFLECTED
7067-76048-0007 ITS DELIGHT WAS PARTICULARLY MANIFEST IN THE CREAM AND SALAD IT PRODUCED FOR LUNCH BOTH MISS GRAMMONT AND MISS SEYFFERT DISPLAYED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THEIR FOOD AFTER LUNCH THEY HAD ALL GONE OUT TO THE STONES AND THE WALL
7067-76048-0008 TO A HAPPY USE BY CLAMBERING TO THE TOP OF IT AND SLIDING ON THEIR LITTLE BEHINDS DOWN ITS SMOOTH AND SLOPING SIDE AMIDST MUCH MIRTHFUL SQUEALING
7067-76048-0009 SIR RICHMOND AND MISS GRAMMONT HAD WALKED ROUND THE OLD CIRCUMVALLATION TOGETHER BUT BELINDA SEYFFERT HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THEM PROFESSING AN INTEREST IN FLOWERS
7067-76048-0010 THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS CONFUSED OLD WORLD AND RESHAPE IT SET IT MARCHING TOWARDS THAT NEW WORLD OF YOURS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FULLY DEVELOPED BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY PEOPLE WHY NOT
7067-76048-0011 NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING WITH THE WORLD EXCEPT MUDDLE ABOUT WHY NOT GIVE IT A DIRECTION YOU'D TAKE IT IN YOUR HANDS LIKE CLAY OBDURATE CLAY WITH A SORT OF RECALCITRANT UNINTELLIGENT LIFE OF ITS OWN
7067-76048-0012 HER IMAGINATION GLOWED IN HER EYES AND WARMED HER VOICE I BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY IS POSSIBLE IF PEOPLE DARE I AM TIRED OF FOLLOWING LITTLE MOTIVES THAT ARE LIKE FLAMES THAT GO OUT WHEN YOU GET TO THEM
7067-76048-0013 I AM TIRED OF SEEING ALL THE WORLD DOING THE SAME I AM TIRED OF A WORLD IN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING GREAT BUT GREAT DISASTERS HERE IS SOMETHING MANKIND CAN ATTEMPT THAT WE CAN ATTEMPT AND WILL I BELIEVE THAT AS MANKIND GROWS UP
7067-76048-0014 AND PRIDE OURSELVES UPON OUR FREEDOM FROM THE SIN OF PRESUMPTION NOT QUITE THAT WELL HOW DO YOU PUT IT WE ARE AFRAID SHE SAID IT'S TOO VAST WE WANT BRIGHT LITTLE LIVES OF OUR OWN
7067-76048-0015 SENSIBLE LITTLE PIGGY WIGGYS WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE AND HAPPINESS FIRST SAID SIR RICHMOND AS MUCH RIGHT AS A PIG HAS TO FOOD BUT WHETHER WE GET LIFE AND HAPPINESS OR FAIL TO GET THEM WE HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0016 WHO HAVE IMAGINATIONS WANT SOMETHING MORE NOWADAYS OF COURSE WE WANT BRIGHT LIVES OF COURSE WE WANT HAPPINESS JUST AS WE WANT FOOD JUST AS WE WANT SLEEP BUT WHEN WE HAVE EATEN WHEN WE HAVE SLEPT WHEN WE HAVE JOLLY THINGS ABOUT US IT IS NOTHING
7067-76048-0017 WE HAVE BEEN MADE AN EXCEPTION OF AND GOT OUR RATIONS THE BIG THING CONFRONTS US STILL
7067-76048-0018 I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE SO BUT I AM COMPELLED BY SOMETHING IN MY NATURE TO WANT TO SERVE THIS IDEA OF A NEW AGE FOR MANKIND I WANT IT AS MY CULMINATING WANT I WANT A WORLD IN ORDER
7067-76048-0019 A DISCIPLINED MANKIND GOING ON TO GREATER THINGS DON'T YOU NOW YOU TELL ME OF IT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE I DO BUT BEFORE NO YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE
7067-76048-0020 I'VE BEEN TALKING OF THIS SORT OF THING WITH MY FRIEND DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND I'VE BEEN THINKING AS WELL AS TALKING THAT PERHAPS IS WHY I'M SO CLEAR AND POSITIVE I DON'T COMPLAIN THAT YOU ARE CLEAR AND POSITIVE I'VE BEEN COMING ALONG THE SAME WAY
7067-76048-0021 IT'S REFRESHING TO MEET YOU I FOUND IT REFRESHING TO MEET MARTINEAU A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT DOCTOR MARTINEAU TURNED SIR RICHMOND INTO A NEW CHANNEL HE'S A MOST INTERESTING MAN HE SAID RATHER SHY IN SOME RESPECTS
7067-76048-0022 DEVOTED TO HIS WORK AND HE'S WRITING A BOOK WHICH HAS SATURATED HIM IN THESE IDEAS ONLY TWO NIGHTS AGO WE STOOD HERE AND TALKED ABOUT IT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE THE WORLD HE BELIEVES IS ENTERING UPON A NEW PHASE IN ITS HISTORY
7067-76048-0023 THE ADOLESCENCE SO TO SPEAK OF MANKIND IT IS AN IDEA THAT SEIZES THE IMAGINATION THERE IS A FLOW OF NEW IDEAS ABROAD HE THINKS WIDENING REALIZATIONS UNPRECEDENTED HOPES AND FEARS
7067-76048-0024 THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEW POWERS AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WE ARE SHARING THE ADOLESCENCE OF OUR RACE IT IS GIVING HISTORY A NEW AND MORE INTIMATE MEANING FOR US
7067-76048-0025 MAKING THEM MATTER AS FORMERLY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER THAT IDEA OF THE BRIGHT LITTLE PRIVATE LIFE HAS TO GO BY THE BOARD I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID MEDITATIVELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OVER SOME SUCH QUESTION BEFORE
7067-76048-0026 INCIDENTALLY HE SMILED I WANT TO GET A LASSO OVER THE NECK OF THAT VERY FORCIBLE AND BARBARIC PERSON YOUR FATHER I AM DOING MY BEST TO HELP LAY THE FOUNDATION OF A SCIENTIFIC WORLD CONTROL OF FUEL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
7067-76048-0027 BUT CONTROLLING FATHER AS DISTINGUISHED FROM MANAGING HIM SHE REVIEWED SOME PRIVATE AND AMUSING MEMORIES HE IS A MOST INTRACTABLE MAN SECTION THREE
7067-76048-0028 THEY HAD GONE ON TO TALK OF HER FATHER AND OF THE TYPES OF MEN WHO CONTROLLED INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SHE HAD HAD PLENTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION IN THEIR HOMES AND HER OWN
7067-76048-0029 GUNTER LAKE THE BIG BANKER SHE KNEW PARTICULARLY WELL BECAUSE IT SEEMED SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED OR WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM ALL THESE PEOPLE SHE SAID ARE PUSHING THINGS ABOUT AFFECTING MILLIONS OF LIVES
7067-76048-0030 YOU WILL FIND MY FATHER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT SOME OF OUR YOUNGER MEN WOULD LOVE IT AND SHE WENT ON THERE ARE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO'D LOVE IT TOO WE'RE PETTED WE'RE KEPT OUT OF THINGS WE AREN'T PLACED
7067-76048-0031 WE DON'T GET ENOUGH TO DO WE'RE SPENDERS AND WASTERS NOT ALWAYS FROM CHOICE WHILE THESE FATHERS AND BROTHERS AND HUSBANDS OF OURS PLAY ABOUT WITH THE FUEL AND POWER AND LIFE AND HOPE OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GAME OF POKER
7067-76048-0032 WITH ALL THE EMPTY UNSPEAKABLE SOLEMNITY OF THE MALE AND TREAT US AS THOUGH WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED IF THEY BRING HOME PART OF THE WINNINGS THAT CAN'T GO ON SHE SAID HER EYES WENT BACK TO THE LONG LOW UNDULATING SKYLINE OF THE DOWNS
7067-76048-0033 SHE SPOKE AS THOUGH SHE TOOK UP THE THREAD OF SOME CONTROVERSY THAT HAD PLAYED A LARGE PART IN HER LIFE THAT ISN'T GOING ON SHE SAID WITH AN EFFECT OF CONCLUSIVE DECISION
7067-76048-0034 SIR RICHMOND RECALLED THAT LITTLE SPEECH NOW AS HE RETURNED FROM SALISBURY STATION TO THE OLD GEORGE AFTER HIS FAREWELL TO MARTINEAU HE RECALLED TOO THE SOFT FIRMNESS OF HER PROFILE AND THE DELICATE LINE OF HER LIFTED CHIN
7067-76048-0035 HE FELT THAT THIS TIME AT ANY RATE HE WAS NOT BEING DECEIVED BY THE OUTWARD SHOWS OF A CHARMING HUMAN BEING THIS YOUNG WOMAN HAD REAL FIRMNESS OF CHARACTER TO BACK UP HER FREE AND INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS
7067-76048-0036 IN THE COMPOSITION OF SO SURE AND GALLANT A PERSONALITY MARTINEAU WAS VERY FINE MINDED IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HE WAS AN OLD MAID AND LIKE ALL OLD MAIDS HE SAW MAN AND WOMAN IN EVERY ENCOUNTER
7067-76048-0037 BUT PASSION WAS A THING MEN AND WOMEN FELL BACK UPON WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON WHEN THEY THOUGHT IN THE PLEASANTEST HARMONY AND EVERY REMARK SEEMED TO WEAVE A FRESH THREAD OF COMMON INTEREST THEN IT WASN'T SO NECESSARY IT MIGHT HAPPEN
7067-76048-0038 HER VIEWS ABOUT AMERICA AND ABOUT HER OWN PLACE IN THE WORLD SEEMED EQUALLY FRESH AND ORIGINAL TO SIR RICHMOND I REALIZE I'VE GOT TO BE A RESPONSIBLE AMERICAN CITIZEN SHE HAD SAID
7067-76048-0039 THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT SHE ATTACHED VERY MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HER RECENTLY ACQUIRED VOTE SHE EVIDENTLY CLASSIFIED VOTERS INTO THE IRRESPONSIBLE WHO JUST HAD VOTES AND THE RESPONSIBLE WHO ALSO HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AS WELL
7067-76048-0040 SHE HAD NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE POWER OF THE FORMER CLASS IT DIDN'T EXIST THEY WERE STEERED TO THEIR DECISIONS BY PEOPLE EMPLOYED DIRECTED OR STIMULATED BY FATHER AND HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES THE OWNERS OF AMERICA THE REAL RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS
7067-76048-0041 OR THEY FELL A PREY TO THE MERELY ADVENTUROUS LEADING OF REVOLUTIONARIES BUT ANYHOW THEY WERE STEERED SHE HERSELF IT WAS CLEAR WAS BOUND TO BECOME A VERY RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN INDEED
7067-76048-0042 SHE WOULD SOME DAY SHE LAUGHED BE SWIMMING IN OIL AND SUCH LIKE PROPERTY HER INTEREST IN SIR RICHMOND'S SCHEMES FOR A SCIENTIFIC WORLD MANAGEMENT OF FUEL WAS THEREFORE SHE REALIZED A VERY DIRECT ONE BUT IT WAS REMARKABLE TO FIND A YOUNG WOMAN SEEING IT LIKE THAT
7067-76048-0043 FATHER IT SEEMED VARIED VERY MUCH IN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER HE DESPISED AND DISTRUSTED WOMEN GENERALLY AND IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD MADE IT QUITE CLEAR TO HER HOW GRAVE AN ERROR IT WAS ON HER PART TO PERSIST IN BEING A DAUGHTER AND NOT A SON
7067-76048-0044 AT MOMENTS IT SEEMED TO SIR RICHMOND THAT SHE WAS DISPOSED TO AGREE WITH FATHER UPON THAT WHEN MISTER GRAMMONT'S SENSE OF HER REGRETTABLE FEMININITY WAS UPPERMOST
7067-76048-0045 AND THEN HE WOULD DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO A KIND OF MASCULINIZATION OF HIS DAUGHTER AND TO SCHEMES FOR GIVING HER THE COMPLETEST CONTROL OF ALL HE HAD TO LEAVE HER PROVIDED SHE NEVER MARRIED NOR FELL UNDER MASCULINE SWAY AFTER ALL
7067-76048-0046 HE WOULD REFLECT AS HE HESITATED OVER THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS LIFE'S IDEAL THERE WAS HETTY GREEN THIS LATTER IDEA HAD REFT HER SUDDENLY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN FROM THE EDUCATIONAL CARE OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN WARRANTED TO FIT HER FOR MARRIAGE WITH ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
7067-76048-0047 AFTER A SWIFT BUT COMPETENT TRAINING INTO A SHIRT WAIST AND AN OFFICE DOWN TOWN SHE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED AT FIRST TO A HARVESTER CONCERN INDEPENDENT OF MISTER GRAMMONT BECAUSE HE FEARED HIS OWN PEOPLE WOULDN'T TRAIN HER HARD
7067-76048-0048 SHE HAD WORKED FOR ORDINARY WAGES AND ORDINARY HOURS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE MENTIONED CASUALLY A LARGE AUTOMOBILE WITH TWO MENSERVANTS
7067-76048-0049 THIS MASCULINIZATION IDEA HAD ALSO SENT HER ON A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO MEXICO THERE APPARENTLY SHE HAD REALLY DONE RESPONSIBLE WORK BUT UPON THE QUESTION OF LABOUR MISTER GRAMMONT WAS FIERCE
7067-76048-0050 HE DISCOVERED HIS DAUGHTER DISPLAYING WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN IMPROPER FAMILIARITY WITH SOCIALIST IDEAS
7067-76048-0051 AND THE IDEA OF A MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE WITH GUNTER LAKE GUNTER LAKE SIR RICHMOND GATHERED WASN'T HALF A BAD FELLOW GENERALLY IT WOULD SEEM MISS GRAMMONT LIKED HIM AND SHE HAD A WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN SOME WAY
7067-76048-0052 MISTER LAKE HAD BEEN RATHER HARDLY USED AND HAD ACQUIRED MERIT BY HIS BEHAVIOUR UNDER BAD TREATMENT THERE WAS SOME STORY HOWEVER CONNECTED WITH HER WAR SERVICES IN EUROPE UPON WHICH MISS GRAMMONT WAS EVIDENTLY INDISPOSED TO DWELL
7067-76048-0053 STILL QUITE VAGUELY GUESSING SO MUCH FACT ABOUT MISS GRAMMONT AS WE HAVE GIVEN HAD FLOATED UP IN FRAGMENTS AND PIECED ITSELF TOGETHER IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND IN THE COURSE OF A DAY AND A HALF THE FRAGMENTS CAME UP AS ALLUSIONS OR BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION
7067-76048-0054 THE SUSTAINING TOPIC WAS THIS NEW AGE SIR RICHMOND FORE SHADOWED THIS WORLD UNDER SCIENTIFIC CONTROL THE UTOPIA OF FULLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE FULLY DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH
7067-76048-0055 FOR A NUMBER OF TRIVIAL REASONS SIR RICHMOND FOUND HIMSELF ASCRIBING THE PROJECT OF THIS NEW AGE ALMOST WHOLLY TO DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND PRESENTING IT AS A MUCH COMPLETER SCHEME THAN HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING IT WAS TRUE THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU HAD NOT SAID MANY OF THE THINGS SIR RICHMOND ASCRIBED TO HIM
7067-76048-0056 BUT ALSO IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD NOT CRYSTALLIZED OUT IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND BEFORE HIS TALKS WITH DOCTOR MARTINEAU THE IDEA OF A NEW AGE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF FRESH RULES OF CONDUCT AND OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0057 AND IT THROWS THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT IT INTO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A COMMON ENTERPRISE TO MORROW THE NEW AGE WILL BE HERE NO DOUBT BUT TODAY IT IS THE HOPE AND ADVENTURE OF ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT IT WAS NATURAL FOR MISS GRAMMONT AND SIR RICHMOND TO ASK
7067-76048-0058 WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH SUCH TYPES AS FATHER AND TO FALL INTO AN IDIOM THAT ASSUMED A JOINT ENTERPRISE THEY HAD AGREED BY A TACIT CONSENT TO A COMMON CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD THEY DESIRED AS A WORLD SCIENTIFICALLY ORDERED
7067-76048-0059 AN IMMENSE ORGANIZATION OF MATURE COMMONSENSE HEALTHY AND SECURE GATHERING KNOWLEDGE AND POWER FOR CREATIVE ADVENTURES AS YET BEYOND DREAMING
7067-76048-0060 AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE

4340-15220-0092 FISHING OUT SEVERAL FRAGMENTS OF GINGERBREAD STARVING AND BAB ATE THEM WITH SUCH A RELISH THAT SAM ADDED A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AND BEN CAUGHT SOME WATER FOR HER IN HIS HAND WHERE THE LITTLE SPRING BUBBLED UP BESIDE A STONE NOW
4340-15220-0093 COMMANDED BEN GIVING SANCH A ROLL ON THE GRASS TO CLEAN HIM BAB SCRUBBED HER FACE TILL IT SHONE AND PULLING DOWN HER APRON TO WIPE IT SCATTERED A LOAD OF TREASURES COLLECTED IN HER WALK SOME OF THE DEAD FLOWERS
4340-15220-0094 BITS OF MOSS AND GREEN TWIGS FELL NEAR BEN AND ONE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION A SPRAY OF BROAD SMOOTH LEAVES WITH A BUNCH OF WHITISH BERRIES ON IT WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HE ASKED POKING IT WITH HIS FOOT
4340-15220-0095 IN A SWAMPY PLACE COMING ALONG SANCH SAW SOMETHING DOWN THERE AND I WENT WITH HIM CAUSE I THOUGHT MAY BE IT WAS A MUSK RAT AND YOU'D LIKE ONE IF WE COULD GET HIM

4340-15220-0100 NOT FOR A DAY OR SO I GUESS BUT IT'S BAD WHEN IT DOES COME
1246-124550-0000 THOUGH THE ARMISTICE WITH GERMANY WAS SIGNED A FEW WEEKS AFTER HER COMING TO WASHINGTON THE WORK OF THE BUREAU CONTINUED SHE FILED CORRESPONDENCE ALL DAY THEN SHE DICTATED ANSWERS TO LETTERS OF INQUIRY IT WAS AN ENDURANCE OF MONOTONOUS DETAILS
1246-124550-0001 YET SHE ASSERTED THAT SHE HAD FOUND REAL WORK DISILLUSIONS SHE DID HAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT IN THE AFTERNOON OFFICE ROUTINE STRETCHES TO THE GRAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT AN OFFICE IS AS FULL OF CLIQUES AND SCANDALS AS A GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0002 A FREE SUNDAY IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT WORLD NEEDED HER INSPIRATION BUT SHE FELT THAT HER LETTERS HER CONTACT WITH THE ANXIETIES OF MEN AND WOMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE A PART OF VAST AFFAIRS
1246-124550-0003 NOT CONFINED TO MAIN STREET AND A KITCHEN BUT LINKED WITH PARIS BANGKOK MADRID SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE COULD DO OFFICE WORK WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF THE PUTATIVE FEMININE VIRTUE OF DOMESTICITY THAT COOKING AND CLEANING
1246-124550-0004 NOT TO HAVE TO REPORT TO KENNICOTT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE OR MIGHT DO WAS A RELIEF WHICH MADE UP FOR THE OFFICE WEARINESS SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER ONE HALF OF A MARRIAGE
1246-124550-0005 WHITE COLUMNS SEEN ACROSS LEAFY PARKS SPACIOUS AVENUES TWISTY ALLEYS DAILY SHE PASSED A DARK SQUARE HOUSE WITH A HINT OF MAGNOLIAS AND A COURTYARD BEHIND IT AND A TALL CURTAINED SECOND STORY WINDOW THROUGH WHICH A WOMAN WAS ALWAYS PEERING
1246-124550-0006 THE WOMAN WAS MYSTERY ROMANCE A STORY WHICH TOLD ITSELF DIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY NOW SHE WAS A MURDERESS NOW THE NEGLECTED WIFE OF AN AMBASSADOR IT WAS MYSTERY WHICH CAROL HAD MOST LACKED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0007 WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS OPEN TO VIEW WHERE EVERY PERSON WAS BUT TOO EASY TO MEET WHERE THERE WERE NO SECRET GATES OPENING UPON MOORS OVER WHICH ONE MIGHT WALK BY MOSS DEADENED PATHS TO STRANGE HIGH ADVENTURES IN AN ANCIENT GARDEN
1246-124550-0008 AS SHE FLITTED UP SIXTEENTH STREET AFTER A KREISLER RECITAL GIVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE GOVERNMENT CLERKS AS THE LAMPS KINDLED IN SPHERES OF SOFT FIRE AS THE BREEZE FLOWED INTO THE STREET FRESH AS PRAIRIE WINDS AND KINDLIER
1246-124550-0009 AS SHE GLANCED UP THE ELM ALLEY OF MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE AS SHE WAS RESTED BY THE INTEGRITY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE TEMPLE SHE LOVED THE CITY AS SHE LOVED NO ONE SAVE HUGH SHE ENCOUNTERED NEGRO SHANTIES TURNED INTO STUDIOS
1246-124550-0010 WITH ORANGE CURTAINS AND POTS OF MIGNONETTE MARBLE HOUSES ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE WITH BUTLERS AND LIMOUSINES AND MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE FICTIONAL EXPLORERS AND AVIATORS HER DAYS WERE SWIFT AND SHE KNEW THAT IN HER FOLLY OF RUNNING AWAY
1246-124550-0011 WERE THE MEMBERS OF THE TINCOMB METHODIST CHURCH A VAST RED BRICK TABERNACLE VIDA SHERWIN HAD GIVEN HER A LETTER TO AN EARNEST WOMAN WITH EYE GLASSES PLAID SILK WAIST AND A BELIEF IN BIBLE CLASSES WHO INTRODUCED HER TO THE PASTOR AND THE
1246-124550-0012 THEY WENT TO SUNDAY SERVICE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR MISSIONARY LECTURES CHURCH SUPPERS PRECISELY AS THEY HAD AT HOME THEY AGREED THAT AMBASSADORS AND FLIPPANT NEWSPAPERMEN AND INFIDEL SCIENTISTS OF THE BUREAUS
1246-124550-0013 WERE EQUALLY WICKED AND TO BE AVOIDED AND BY CLEAVING TO TINCOMB CHURCH THEY KEPT THEIR IDEALS FROM ALL CONTAMINATION THEY WELCOMED CAROL ASKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND GAVE HER ADVICE REGARDING COLIC IN BABIES
1246-124550-0014 PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
1246-124550-0015 ALWAYS SHE WAS TO PERCEIVE IN WASHINGTON AS DOUBTLESS SHE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IN NEW YORK OR LONDON A THICK STREAK OF MAIN STREET THE CAUTIOUS DULLNESS OF A GOPHER PRAIRIE APPEARED IN BOARDING HOUSES WHERE LADYLIKE BUREAU CLERKS
1246-124550-0016 ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR THE CAPTAIN INTRODUCED HER TO THE SECRETARY OF A CONGRESSMAN A CYNICAL YOUNG WIDOW WITH MANY ACQUAINTANCES IN THE NAVY THROUGH HER CAROL MET COMMANDERS AND MAJORS NEWSPAPERMEN
1246-124550-0017 CHEMISTS AND GEOGRAPHERS AND FISCAL EXPERTS FROM THE BUREAUS AND A TEACHER WHO WAS A FAMILIAR OF THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS THE TEACHER TOOK HER TO HEADQUARTERS CAROL NEVER BECAME A PROMINENT SUFFRAGIST
1246-124550-0018 INDEED HER ONLY RECOGNIZED POSITION WAS AS AN ABLE ADDRESSER OF ENVELOPES BUT SHE WAS CASUALLY ADOPTED BY THIS FAMILY OF FRIENDLY WOMEN WHO WHEN THEY WERE NOT BEING MOBBED OR ARRESTED TOOK DANCING LESSONS OR WENT PICNICKING UP THE CHESAPEAKE CANAL
1246-124550-0019 THOUGH IT ABSORBED MOST OF HER SALARY AN EXCELLENT NURSE FOR HUGH SHE HERSELF PUT HIM TO BED AND PLAYED WITH HIM ON HOLIDAYS THERE WERE WALKS WITH HIM THERE WERE MOTIONLESS EVENINGS OF READING BUT CHIEFLY WASHINGTON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE
1246-124550-0020 SCORES OF THEM SITTING ABOUT THE FLAT TALKING TALKING TALKING NOT ALWAYS WISELY BUT ALWAYS EXCITEDLY IT WAS NOT AT ALL THE ARTIST'S STUDIO OF WHICH BECAUSE OF ITS PERSISTENCE IN FICTION SHE HAD DREAMED
1246-124550-0021 BUT THEY PLAYED VERY SIMPLY AND THEY SAW NO REASON WHY ANYTHING WHICH EXISTS CANNOT ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKED QUITE AS SHE HAD SHOCKED GOPHER PRAIRIE BY THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR CIGARETTES AND ELFISH KNOWLEDGE
1246-124550-0022 THE PRESENCE OF HUGH MADE HER FEEL TEMPORARY SOME DAY OH SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OPEN FIELDS AND THE RIGHT TO CLIMB ABOUT HAY LOFTS BUT THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NEVER BE EMINENT AMONG THESE SCOFFING ENTHUSIASTS
1246-124550-0023 DID NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING PROUD OF THEM FROM DEFENDING THEM IN IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNICOTT WHO GRUNTED SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE THEY'RE SIMPLY A BUNCH OF WILD IMPRACTICAL THEORISTS SITTIN ROUND CHEWING THE RAG AND
1246-124550-0024 THE ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSED BANTER FOR WHICH SHE HAD LONGED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE YET THEY SEEMED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS THE SAM CLARKS SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OF SECURE REPUTATION NOT HEMMED IN BY THE FIRE OF PROVINCIAL JEALOUSIES
1246-124550-0025 KENNICOTT HAD ASSERTED THAT THE VILLAGER'S LACK OF COURTESY IS DUE TO HIS POVERTY WE'RE NO MILLIONAIRE DUDES HE BOASTED YET THESE ARMY AND NAVY MEN THESE BUREAU EXPERTS AND ORGANIZERS OF MULTITUDINOUS LEAGUES
1246-124550-0026 THAT INSTITUTION IS RESERVED FOR MEN LIKE KENNICOTT WHO AFTER DEVOTING FIFTY YEARS TO PUTTING ASIDE A STAKE INCONTINENTLY INVEST THE STAKE IN SPURIOUS OIL STOCKS
1246-124550-0027 SHE FOUND THE SAME FAITH NOT ONLY IN GIRLS ESCAPED FROM DOMESTICITY BUT ALSO IN DEMURE OLD LADIES WHO TRAGICALLY DEPRIVED OF ESTEEMED HUSBANDS AND HUGE OLD HOUSES
1246-124550-0028 YET MANAGED TO MAKE A VERY COMFORTABLE THING OF IT BY LIVING IN SMALL FLATS AND HAVING TIME TO READ BUT SHE ALSO LEARNED THAT BY COMPARISON GOPHER PRAIRIE WAS A MODEL OF DARING COLOR CLEVER PLANNING AND FRENZIED INTELLECTUALITY
1246-124550-0029 FROM HER TEACHER HOUSEMATE SHE HAD A SARDONIC DESCRIPTION OF A MIDDLEWESTERN RAILROAD DIVISION TOWN OF THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT DEVOID OF LAWNS AND TREES A TOWN WHERE THE TRACKS SPRAWLED ALONG THE CINDER SCABBED MAIN STREET AND THE RAILROAD SHOPS
1246-124550-0030 DRIPPING SOOT FROM EAVES AND DOORWAY ROLLED OUT SMOKE IN GREASY COILS OTHER TOWNS SHE CAME TO KNOW BY ANECDOTE A PRAIRIE VILLAGE WHERE THE WIND BLEW ALL DAY LONG AND THE MUD WAS TWO FEET THICK IN SPRING AND IN SUMMER
1246-124550-0031 NEW ENGLAND MILL TOWNS WITH THE HANDS LIVING IN ROWS OF COTTAGES LIKE BLOCKS OF LAVA A RICH FARMING CENTER IN NEW JERSEY OFF THE RAILROAD FURIOUSLY PIOUS RULED BY OLD MEN UNBELIEVABLY IGNORANT OLD MEN
1246-124550-0032 SITTING ABOUT THE GROCERY TALKING OF JAMES G BLAINE A SOUTHERN TOWN FULL OF THE MAGNOLIAS AND WHITE COLUMNS WHICH CAROL HAD ACCEPTED AS PROOF OF ROMANCE BUT HATING THE NEGROES OBSEQUIOUS TO THE OLD FAMILIES
1246-124550-0033 A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
1246-124550-0034 THE LINES ARE BROKEN AND UNCERTAIN OF DIRECTION OFTEN INSTEAD OF RISING THEY SINK IN WAVERING SCRAWLS AND THE COLORS ARE WATERY BLUE AND PINK AND THE DIM GRAY OF RUBBED PENCIL MARKS A FEW LINES ARE TRACEABLE
1246-124550-0035 UNHAPPY WOMEN ARE GIVEN TO PROTECTING THEIR SENSITIVENESS BY CYNICAL GOSSIP BY WHINING BY HIGH CHURCH AND NEW THOUGHT RELIGIONS OR BY A FOG OF VAGUENESS CAROL HAD HIDDEN IN NONE OF THESE REFUGES FROM REALITY
1246-124550-0036 BUT SHE WHO WAS TENDER AND MERRY HAD BEEN MADE TIMOROUS BY GOPHER PRAIRIE EVEN HER FLIGHT HAD BEEN BUT THE TEMPORARY COURAGE OF PANIC THE THING SHE GAINED IN WASHINGTON WAS NOT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICE SYSTEMS AND LABOR UNIONS BUT RENEWED COURAGE
1246-124550-0037 THAT AMIABLE CONTEMPT CALLED POISE HER GLIMPSE OF TASKS INVOLVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND A SCORE OF NATIONS REDUCED MAIN STREET FROM BLOATED IMPORTANCE TO ITS ACTUAL PETTINESS SHE COULD NEVER AGAIN BE QUITE SO AWED BY THE POWER
1246-124550-0038 SHE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF AN IMPERSONAL ATTITUDE SAW THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS TOUCHILY PERSONAL AS MAUD DYER AND WHY SHE BEGAN TO ASK DID SHE RAGE AT INDIVIDUALS NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT INSTITUTIONS ARE THE ENEMIES
1246-124550-0039 AND THEY MOST AFFLICT THE DISCIPLES WHO THE MOST GENEROUSLY SERVE THEM

1088-134315-0012 PROVIDING ALWAYS THAT I CAN SECURE MY OBJECT IN THE TIME OTHERWISE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SEE SHE SAID NODDING HER HEAD QUICKLY I SUPPOSE THAT IS HOW BLACKMAILERS FEEL HE FROWNED
1088-134315-0013 THAT IS A WORD I NEVER USE NOR DO I LIKE TO HEAR IT EMPLOYED HE SAID BLACKMAIL SUGGESTS TO ME A VULGAR ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN MONEY
1088-134315-0014 AND ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT THEY ARE ALSO JUSTIFIED IT IS A MATTER OF PLANE HE SAID AIRILY VIEWED FROM MY STANDPOINT THEY ARE SORDID CRIMINALS THE SORT OF PERSON THAT T X MEETS I PRESUME IN THE COURSE OF HIS DAILY WORK
1088-134315-0015 T X HE WENT ON SOMEWHAT ORACULARLY IS A MAN FOR WHOM I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT YOU WILL PROBABLY MEET HIM AGAIN FOR HE WILL FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT MYSELF I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU
1088-134315-0016 HE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A DEPRECATING SMILE I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT DISCUSS YOUR BUSINESS WITH ANY PERSON SAID THE GIRL COLDLY I AM PAYING YOU THREE POUNDS A WEEK I THINK HE SAID
1088-134315-0017 I INTEND INCREASING THAT TO FIVE POUNDS BECAUSE YOU SUIT ME MOST ADMIRABLY THANK YOU SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY BUT I AM ALREADY BEING PAID QUITE SUFFICIENT SHE LEFT HIM A LITTLE ASTONISHED AND NOT A LITTLE RUFFLED
1088-134315-0018 TO REFUSE THE FAVOURS OF REMINGTON KARA WAS BY HIM REGARDED AS SOMETHING OF AN AFFRONT
1088-134315-0019 HE RANG THE BELL THIS TIME FOR HIS VALET FISHER HE SAID I AM EXPECTING A VISIT FROM A GENTLEMAN NAMED GATHERCOLE A ONE ARMED GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU MUST LOOK AFTER IF HE COMES
1088-134315-0020 DETAIN HIM ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER BECAUSE HE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF AND I WANT TO SEE HIM

1088-134315-0023 CLOSED THE DOOR CAREFULLY AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
1088-134315-0024 THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
1088-134315-0025 KARA WAS GIVEN TO MAKING FRIENDS OF HIS SERVANTS UP TO A POINT IN HIS MORE GENEROUS MOMENTS HE WOULD ADDRESS HIS BODYGUARD AS FRED AND ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON HAD TIPPED HIS SERVANT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY
1088-134315-0026 MISTER FRED FISHER FOUND LITTLE TO REWARD HIM FOR HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE CAME UPON KARA'S CHEQUE BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GREEK HAD DRAWN SIX THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH FROM THE BANK
1088-134315-0027 THIS INTERESTED HIM MIGHTILY AND HE REPLACED THE CHEQUE BOOK WITH THE TIGHTENED LIPS AND THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN WHO WAS THINKING RAPIDLY HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE SECRETARY WAS ENGAGED IN MAKING COPIES OF KARA'S CORRESPONDENCE
1088-134315-0028 ANSWERING LETTERS APPEALING FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND IN THE HACK WORDS WHICH FALL TO THE SECRETARIES OF THE GREAT HE REPLENISHED THE FIRE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS AND RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS QUEST
1088-134315-0029 THIS TIME HE MADE THE BEDROOM THE SCENE OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS THE SAFE HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TOUCH BUT THERE WAS A SMALL BUREAU IN WHICH KARA WOULD HAVE PLACED HIS PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE MORNING THIS HOWEVER YIELDED NO RESULT
1088-134315-0030 RUM COVE SAID FISHER HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT BEFORE THE CLOSED DOOR OF THE ROOM AND SMILINGLY SURVEYED THE GREAT STEEL LATCH WHICH SPANNED THE DOOR AND FITTED INTO AN IRON SOCKET SECURELY SCREWED TO THE FRAMEWORK HE LIFTED IT GINGERLY
1088-134315-0031 THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOB FOR THE PURPOSE AND LET IT FALL GENTLY INTO THE SOCKET WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO RECEIVE IT ON THE DOOR ITSELF RUM COVE HE SAID AGAIN AND LIFTING THE LATCH TO THE HOOK WHICH HELD IT UP LEFT THE ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HIM
1088-134315-0032 HE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR WITH A MEDITATIVE FROWN AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STAIRS TO THE HALL HE WAS LESS THAN HALF WAY DOWN WHEN THE ONE MAID OF KARA'S HOUSEHOLD CAME UP TO MEET HIM THERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WANTS TO SEE MISTER KARA SHE SAID HERE IS HIS CARD
1088-134315-0033 FISHER TOOK THE CARD FROM THE SALVER AND READ MISTER GEORGE GATHERCOLE JUNIOR TRAVELLERS CLUB I'LL SEE THIS GENTLEMAN HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN BRISK INTEREST HE FOUND THE VISITOR STANDING IN THE HALL
1088-134315-0034 HE WAS A MAN WHO WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED ATTENTION IF ONLY FROM THE SOMEWHAT ECCENTRIC NATURE OF HIS DRESS AND HIS UNKEMPT APPEARANCE HE WAS DRESSED IN A WELL WORN OVERCOAT OF A SOMEWHAT PRONOUNCED CHECK HE HAD A TOP HAT GLOSSY AND OBVIOUSLY NEW AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
1088-134315-0035 A PAIR OF PINCE NEZ SAT CROOKEDLY ON HIS NOSE AND TWO FAT VOLUMES UNDER HIS ARM COMPLETED THE PICTURE FISHER WHO WAS AN OBSERVER OF SOME DISCERNMENT NOTICED UNDER THE OVERCOAT A CREASED BLUE SUIT LARGE BLACK BOOTS
1088-134315-0036 AND A PAIR OF PEARL STUDS THE NEWCOMER GLARED ROUND AT THE VALET TAKE THESE HE ORDERED PEREMPTORILY POINTING TO THE BOOKS UNDER HIS ARM FISHER HASTENED TO OBEY AND NOTED WITH SOME WONDER THAT THE VISITOR DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ASSIST HIM
1088-134315-0037 EITHER BY LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF THE VOLUMES OR RAISING HIS HAND ACCIDENTALLY THE VALET'S HAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OTHER'S SLEEVE AND HE RECEIVED A SHOCK FOR THE FOREARM WAS CLEARLY AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IT WAS AGAINST A WOODEN SURFACE BENEATH THE SLEEVE THAT HIS KNUCKLES STRUCK
1088-134315-0038 AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER

1088-134315-0050 THE MAID WHO WAS ALSO COOK AROSE UP AS THE GIRL ENTERED IT'S A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES TO SEE YOU IN MY KITCHEN MISS SHE SMILED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RATHER LONELY MISSUS BEALE SAID THE GIRL SYMPATHETICALLY LONELY MISS CRIED THE MAID

1088-134315-0054 THE GIRL ASCENDED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AGAIN SHE WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE DISAPPEARING FIGURE ONCE OUT OF SIGHT MISS HOLLAND WENT TO WORK WITH A REMARKABLE DELIBERATION AND THOROUGHNESS FROM HER BAG SHE PRODUCED A SMALL PURSE AND OPENED IT
1088-134315-0055 IN THAT CASE WAS A NEW STEEL KEY
1088-134315-0056 IN TWO SECONDS IT WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS IT WAS A LARGE SAFE OF THE USUAL TYPE THERE WERE FOUR STEEL DRAWERS FITTED AT THE BACK AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRONG BOX
1088-134315-0057 AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
1088-134315-0058 IT WAS A SQUARE CASE COVERED IN RED MOROCCO LEATHER SHE INSERTED HER SHAKING HAND AND TOOK IT OUT WITH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE CRY AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUD AND THEN A HAND GRASPED HER WRIST AND IN A PANIC SHE TURNED TO MEET THE SMILING FACE
1088-134318-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE KARA LAY BACK ON HIS DOWN PILLOWS WITH A SNEER ON HIS FACE AND HIS BRAIN VERY BUSY WHAT STARTED THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT AT THAT MOMENT HIS MIND WAS VERY FAR AWAY
1088-134318-0001 IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
1088-134318-0002 TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
1088-134318-0003 TO THAT TERRIBLE HOUR OF WAITING WHEN HE SAT BOUND TO A POST WITH A CANDLE FLICKERING AND SPLUTTERING LOWER AND LOWER TO THE LITTLE HEAP OF GUNPOWDER THAT WOULD START THE TRAIL TOWARD THE CLUMSY INFERNAL MACHINE UNDER HIS CHAIR
1088-134318-0004 HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
1088-134318-0005 HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
1088-134318-0006 HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
1088-134318-0007 KARA BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND HIS FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES WHY OF COURSE TELL HIM TO COME UP ASK HIM IF HE MINDS SEEING ME IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM YOU WERE IN BED SIR AND HE USED SHOCKING LANGUAGE SAID FISHER KARA LAUGHED SEND HIM UP HE SAID
1088-134318-0008 YES SIR SAID THE SERVANT SUCH AN INSTRUCTION WAS REMARKABLY PLEASING TO HIM THERE WAS MUCH THAT HE HAD TO DO AND THAT NIGHT'S FREEDOM WOULD ASSIST HIM MATERIALLY PERHAPS KARA HESITATED PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
1088-134318-0009 BRING ME UP SOME SANDWICHES AND A LARGE GLASS OF MILK OR BETTER STILL PLACE THEM ON A PLATE IN THE HALL VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE MAN AND WITHDREW DOWN BELOW THAT GROTESQUE FIGURE WITH HIS SHINY HAT AND HIS RAGGED BEARD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TESSELATED HALLWAY
1088-134318-0010 MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND STARING AT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE HALL WITH A CERTAIN AMUSED ANTAGONISM MISTER KARA WILL SEE YOU SIR SAID FISHER OH SAID THE OTHER GLARING AT THE UNOFFENDING FISHER THAT'S VERY GOOD OF HIM
1088-134318-0011 YES SIR SAID FISHER LOOK HERE THE MAN THRUST OUT HIS FACE DO YOU SEE THOSE GREY HAIRS IN MY BEARD THE EMBARRASSED FISHER GRINNED IS IT GREY CHALLENGED THE VISITOR WITH A ROAR

1088-134318-0013 THEN LEAD ON FISHER SHOWED THE WAY UP THE STAIRS THIS TIME THE TRAVELLER CARRIED NO BOOKS HIS LEFT ARM HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDE AND FISHER PRIVATELY GATHERED THAT THE HAND HAD GOT LOOSE FROM THE DETAINING POCKET WITHOUT ITS OWNER BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
1088-134318-0014 HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
1088-134318-0015 FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
1088-134318-0016 NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
1088-134318-0017 AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1088-134318-0018 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
1088-134318-0019 ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY IN ADVANCE IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU YES SIR SAID FISHER BUT I THINK YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THAT MISTER KARA IS ALWAYS MOST GENEROUS ABOUT MONEY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT MY POOR MAN SAID THE OTHER YOU
1088-134318-0020 AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
1088-134318-0021 UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
6367-74004-0000 RUGGLES AND I WERE DOWN ON THE OLD FELLOW IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY AND SINCE IN A STORY OF THIS KIND WE MUST TELL THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS OR ELSE WHERE IS THE USE OF WRITING A STORY AT ALL
6367-74004-0001 HE IS PRINCIPAL OF THE FRAMPTON ACADEMY THE OLD FELLOW NOT RUGGLES AND HIS NAME IS GEORGE OSBORNE WE HAVE TO CALL HIM MISTER OSBORNE TO HIS FACE BUT HE IS THE OLD FELLOW EVERYWHERE ELSE
6367-74004-0002 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THEY LIKE HIM TOO I HEARD EMMA WHITE SAY ONCE THAT HE WAS SO HANDSOME I NEARLY WHOOPED RUGGLES WAS MAD BECAUSE HE'S GONE ON EM
6367-74004-0003 HE IS SPLENDID BIG SIX FOOTER WITH MAGNIFICENT MUSCLES RED CHEEKS AND CURLY YELLOW HAIR I CAN'T SEE HOW HE CAN BE CONTENTED TO SIT DOWN AND TEACH MUSHY ENGLISH LITERATURE AND POETRY AND THAT SORT OF THING
6367-74004-0004 THERE WAS A RUMOUR RUNNING AT LARGE IN THE ACADEMY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WROTE POETRY BUT HE RAN THE MATHEMATICS AND DIDN'T MAKE SUCH A FOOZLE OF IT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE EITHER
6367-74004-0005 AT LEAST WE SAID SO BUT IF PROVIDENCE HADN'T SENT SYLVIA GRANT WALKING DOWN THE STREET PAST OUR BOARDING HOUSE THAT AFTERNOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE COOLED OFF BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF ANY WORKING PLAN OF REVENGE SYLVIA GRANT DID GO DOWN THE STREET HOWEVER
6367-74004-0006 RUGGLES HANGING HALFWAY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS USUAL SAW HER AND CALLED ME TO GO AND LOOK OF COURSE I WENT SYLVIA GRANT WAS ALWAYS WORTH LOOKING AT THERE WAS NO GIRL IN FRAMPTON WHO COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO HER WHEN IT CAME TO BEAUTY
6367-74004-0007 MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT SYLVIA HADN'T ANY OR SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE PREFERRED BUT THERE I'M GETTING ON TOO FAST AGAIN RUGGLES SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS STORY HE CAN CONCENTRATE BETTER SYLVIA WAS THE LATIN PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER
6367-74004-0008 SHE WASN'T A CAD GIRL OF COURSE SHE WAS OVER TWENTY AND HAD GRADUATED FROM IT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE WAS IN ALL THE SOCIAL THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE ACADEMY AND ALL THE UNMARRIED PROFESSORS EXCEPT THE OLD FELLOW WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
6367-74004-0009 MICKY HAD IT THE WORST AND WE HAD ALL MADE UP OUR MINDS THAT SYLVIA WOULD MARRY MICKY HE WAS SO HANDSOME WE DIDN'T SEE HOW SHE COULD HELP IT I TELL YOU THEY MADE A DANDY LOOKING COUPLE WHEN THEY WERE TOGETHER WELL AS I SAID BEFORE I TODDLED TO THE WINDOW TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE FAIR SYLVIA
6367-74004-0010 THEY WERE BROWNISH KIND OF AND SHE'D A SPANKING HAT ON WITH FEATHERS AND THINGS IN IT HER HAIR WAS SHINING UNDER IT ALL PURPLY BLACK AND SHE LOOKED SWEET ENOUGH TO EAT
6367-74004-0011 AND HER BIG BLACKISH BLUE EYES SPARKLED BUT SHE HADN'T BEEN LAUGHING BEFORE OR SPARKLING EITHER
6367-74004-0012 I RATHER SUSPECTED IT FOR AT THE SENIOR PROM THREE NIGHTS BEFORE SHE HAD HARDLY LOOKED AT MICKY BUT HAD SAT IN A CORNER AND TALKED TO THE OLD FELLOW HE DIDN'T DO MUCH TALKING HE WAS TOO SHY AND HE LOOKED MIGHTY UNCOMFORTABLE
6367-74004-0013 BUT WHEN I SAW MICKY SCOWLING AT THE CORNER I KNEW SHE WAS DOING IT TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS GIRLS WON'T STICK AT ANYTHING WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVOKE A CHAP I KNOW IT TO MY COST FOR JENNIE PRICE
6367-74004-0014 HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
6367-74004-0015 LET'S WRITE A LETTER TO SYLVIA GRANT A LOVE LETTER AND SIGN THE OLD FELLOW'S NAME TO IT SHE'LL GIVE HIM A FEARFUL SNUBBING AND WE'LL BE REVENGED BUT WHO'LL WRITE IT I SAID DOUBTFULLY I CAN'T
6367-74004-0016 YOU'LL HAVE TO RUGGLES YOU'VE HAD MORE PRACTICE RUGGLES TURNED RED I KNOW HE WRITES TO EM WHITE IN VACATIONS I'LL DO MY BEST HE SAID QUITE MEEKLY THAT IS I'LL COMPOSE IT BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COPY IT
6367-74004-0017 YOU CAN IMITATE THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING SO WELL BUT LOOK HERE I SAID AN UNCOMFORTABLE IDEA STRIKING ME WHAT ABOUT SYLVIA WON'T SHE FEEL KIND OF FLATTISH WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT FOR OF COURSE HE'LL TELL HER
6367-74004-0018 SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE OLD FELLOW A BIT I KNOW FROM THE WAY SHE ACTS WITH HIM SHE'S ALWAYS SO COOL AND STIFF WHEN HE'S ABOUT NOT A BIT LIKE SHE IS WITH THE OTHER PROFESSORS WELL RUGGLES WROTE THE LETTER AT FIRST HE TRIED TO PASS IT OFF ON ME AS HIS OWN COMPOSITION
6367-74004-0019 BUT I KNOW A FEW LITTLE THINGS AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT RUGGLES COULDN'T HAVE MADE UP THAT LETTER ANY MORE THAN HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN A SONNET I TOLD HIM SO AND MADE HIM OWN UP HE HAD A COPY OF AN OLD LETTER THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO HIS SISTER BY HER YOUNG MAN
6367-74004-0020 ANYHOW THAT LETTER JUST FILLED THE BILL IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESSED RUGGLES'S SISTER'S YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE POSSESSED LOTS OF ABILITY HE WAS AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR SOMETHING LIKE MICKY
6367-74004-0021 HE STARTED IN BY TELLING HER HOW MUCH HE LOVED HER AND WHAT AN ANGEL OF BEAUTY AND GOODNESS HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER HOW UNWORTHY HE FELT HIMSELF OF HER AND HOW LITTLE HOPE HE HAD THAT SHE COULD EVER CARE FOR HIM
6367-74004-0022 AND HE WOUND UP BY IMPLORING HER TO TELL HIM IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE HIM A LITTLE BIT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I COPIED THE LETTER OUT ON HELIOTROPE PAPER IN MY BEST IMITATION OF THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING AND SIGNED IT YOURS DEVOTEDLY AND IMPLORINGLY
6367-74004-0023 GEORGE OSBORNE THEN WE MAILED IT THAT VERY EVENING
6367-74004-0024 IT WAS THE SMARTEST EVENT OF THE TERM AND EVERYBODY WAS THERE STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND OF COURSE SYLVIA GRANT SYLVIA LOOKED STUNNING
6367-74004-0025 AND AVOIDED POOR MICKY SO SKILFULLY THAT IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO WATCH HER THE OLD FELLOW CAME IN LATE WITH HIS TIE ALL CROOKED AS IT ALWAYS WAS I SAW SYLVIA BLUSH AND NUDGED RUGGLES TO LOOK SHE'S THINKING OF THE LETTER HE SAID
6367-74004-0026 RUGGLES AND I NEVER MEANT TO LISTEN UPON MY WORD WE DIDN'T IT WAS PURE ACCIDENT WE WERE IN BEHIND THE FLAGS AND PALMS IN THE MODERN LANGUAGES ROOM FIXING UP A PLAN HOW TO GET EM AND JENNIE OFF FOR A MOONLIT STROLL IN THE GROUNDS
6367-74004-0027 SYLVIA STILL LOOKED SMILING AND HAPPY NOT A BIT MAD AS WE HAD EXPECTED BUT JUST KIND OF SHY AND RADIANT AS FOR THE OLD FELLOW HE LOOKED AS EM WHITE WOULD SAY AS SPHINX LIKE AS EVER
6367-74004-0028 OR SAID MY LETTER OR SHOWN SURPRISE IN SOME WAY
6367-74004-0029 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT SYLVIA FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID KIND OF DRILY AH DID YOU YES SAID SYLVIA NOT MUCH ABOVE A WHISPER IT IT SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH I NEVER SUPPOSED THAT YOU
6367-74004-0030 HIS VOICE ACTUALLY TREMBLED I I DON'T THINK I WOULD TELL YOU IF I KNEW SAID SYLVIA TURNING HER HEAD AWAY YOU SEE I DON'T WANT YOU TO HELP CARING SYLVIA
6367-74004-0031 YOU NEVER SAW SUCH A TRANSFORMATION AS CAME OVER THE OLD FELLOW HIS EYES JUST BLAZED BUT HIS FACE WENT WHITE HE BENT FORWARD AND TOOK HER HAND SYLVIA
6367-74004-0032 DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU YOU ACTUALLY CARE A LITTLE FOR ME DEAREST OH SYLVIA DO YOU MEAN THAT OF COURSE I DO SAID SYLVIA RIGHT OUT
6367-74004-0033 I'VE ALWAYS CARED EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL COMING HERE TO SCHOOL AND BREAKING MY HEART OVER MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH I HATED THEM JUST TO BE IN YOUR CLASS WHY WHY
6367-74004-0034 I THOUGHT IT QUITE USELESS TO TELL YOU OF MY LOVE BEFORE WILL YOU CAN YOU BE MY WIFE DARLING AT THIS POINT RUGGLES AND I DIFFER AS TO WHAT CAME NEXT
6367-74004-0035 HE ASSERTS THAT SYLVIA TURNED SQUARE AROUND AND KISSED THE OLD FELLOW BUT I'M SURE SHE JUST TURNED HER FACE AND GAVE HIM A LOOK AND THEN HE KISSED HER ANYHOW
6367-74004-0036 THERE THEY BOTH WERE GOING ON AT THE SILLIEST RATE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY LOVED EACH OTHER AND HOW THE OLD FELLOW THOUGHT SHE LOVED MICKY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING IT WAS AWFUL I NEVER THOUGHT THE OLD FELLOW OR SYLVIA EITHER COULD BE SO SPOONEY
6367-74004-0037 RUGGLES AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING ON EARTH TO BE OUT OF THAT WE KNEW WE'D NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE AND WE FELT AS FOOLISH AS FLATFISH IT WAS A TREMENDOUS RELIEF WHEN THE OLD FELLOW AND SYLVIA GOT UP AT LAST AND TRAILED AWAY BOTH OF THEM LOOKING IDIOTICALLY HAPPY
4362-15663-0000 A PERILOUS NIGHT ON SHASTA'S SUMMIT TOWARD THE END OF SUMMER AFTER A LIGHT OPEN WINTER ONE MAY REACH THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SHASTA WITHOUT PASSING OVER MUCH SNOW BY KEEPING ON THE CREST OF A LONG NARROW RIDGE
4362-15663-0001 MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
4362-15663-0002 PRESENTING A MOST GLORIOUS MASS OF WINTER MOUNTAIN SCENERY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I SCRAMBLED AND REVELED OR LAY SNUGLY SNOWBOUND ENJOYING THE FERTILE CLOUDS AND THE SNOW BLOOM IN ALL THEIR GROWING DRIFTING GRANDEUR
4362-15663-0003 THE FIRST RAINS HAD FALLEN ON THE LOWLANDS AND THE FIRST SNOWS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH AND BRACING WHILE AN ABUNDANCE OF BALMY SUNSHINE FILLED ALL THE NOONDAY HOURS
4362-15663-0004 IT WAS THE CALM AFTERGLOW THAT USUALLY SUCCEEDS THE FIRST STORM OF THE WINTER I MET MANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAD REARED THEIR YOUNG AND SPENT THEIR SUMMER IN THE SHASTA WOODS AND CHAPARRAL THEY WERE THEN ON THEIR WAY SOUTH TO THEIR WINTER HOMES
4362-15663-0005 LEADING THEIR YOUNG FULL FLEDGED AND ABOUT AS LARGE AND STRONG AS THE PARENTS SQUIRRELS DRY AND ELASTIC AFTER THE STORMS WERE BUSY ABOUT THEIR STORES OF PINE NUTS AND THE LATEST GOLDENRODS WERE STILL IN BLOOM THOUGH IT WAS NOW PAST THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER
4362-15663-0006 THE GRAND COLOR GLOW THE AUTUMNAL JUBILEE OF RIPE LEAVES WAS PAST PRIME BUT FRESHENED BY THE RAIN WAS STILL MAKING A FINE SHOW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AND IN THE RAVINES AND THE DELLS OF THE SMALLER STREAMS
4362-15663-0007 AT THE SALMON HATCHING ESTABLISHMENT ON THE MC CLOUD RIVER I HALTED A WEEK TO EXAMINE THE LIMESTONE BELT GRANDLY DEVELOPED THERE TO LEARN WHAT I COULD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIVER AND ITS BANKS
4362-15663-0008 AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE FRESH SNOW THAT I KNEW HAD FALLEN ON THE MOUNTAIN TO SETTLE SOMEWHAT WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THE ASCENT A PEDESTRIAN ON THESE MOUNTAIN ROADS ESPECIALLY SO LATE IN THE YEAR IS SURE TO EXCITE CURIOSITY
4362-15663-0009 AND MANY WERE THE INTERROGATIONS CONCERNING MY RAMBLE WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS SIMPLY TAKING A WALK AND THAT ICY SHASTA WAS MY MARK I WAS INVARIABLY ADMONISHED THAT I HAD COME ON A DANGEROUS QUEST THE TIME WAS FAR TOO LATE
4362-15663-0010 THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
4362-15663-0011 AND DECLARED THE ASCENT OF SHASTA BUTTE THROUGH LOOSE SNOW IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS BEFORE NOON OF THE SECOND OF NOVEMBER I WAS IN THE FROSTY AZURE OF THE UTMOST SUMMIT WHEN I ARRIVED AT SISSON'S EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
4362-15663-0012 AND I WAS IN HASTE TO BE OFF AND GET MYSELF ESTABLISHED SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDST OF IT WHETHER THE SUMMIT WAS TO BE ATTAINED OR NOT SISSON WHO IS A MOUNTAINEER SPEEDILY FITTED ME OUT FOR STORM OR CALM AS ONLY A MOUNTAINEER COULD
4362-15663-0013 AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
4362-15663-0014 THERE I COULD BUILD A STORM NEST AND LIE WARM AND MAKE RAIDS UP AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WEATHER SETTING OUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER FIRST WITH JEROME FAY MOUNTAINEER AND GUIDE IN CHARGE OF THE ANIMALS
4362-15663-0015 THE SNOW OF COURSE GROWING STEADILY DEEPER AND LOOSER SO THAT WE HAD TO BREAK A TRAIL THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO GET DISCOURAGED AND AFTER NIGHT AND DARKNESS CAME ON THEY BECAME ENTANGLED IN A BED OF ROUGH LAVA
4362-15663-0016 WHERE BREAKING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF MEALY SNOW THEIR FEET WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN ANGULAR BOULDERS HERE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LOST BUT AFTER WE HAD REMOVED PACKS AND SADDLES AND ASSISTED THEIR EFFORTS WITH ROPES
4362-15663-0017 THEY ALL ESCAPED TO THE SIDE OF A RIDGE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE TIMBERLINE TO GO FARTHER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO WE WERE COMPELLED TO CAMP AS BEST WE COULD A PITCH PINE FIRE SPEEDILY CHANGED THE TEMPERATURE
4362-15663-0018 AND SHED A BLAZE OF LIGHT ON THE WILD LAVA SLOPE AND THE STRAGGLING STORM BENT PINES AROUND US MELTED SNOW ANSWERED FOR COFFEE AND WE HAD PLENTY OF VENISON TO ROAST TOWARD MIDNIGHT I ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS SLEPT AN HOUR AND A HALF
4362-15663-0019 AND INDICATED THE WAY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARKNESS HE SEEMED LOATH TO LEAVE ME BUT BEING REASSURED THAT I WAS AT HOME AND REQUIRED NO CARE HE BADE ME GOOD BYE AND RETURNED TO CAMP READY TO LEAD HIS ANIMALS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK
4362-15663-0020 ALONE IN THE SOLEMN SILENCE OF THE NIGHT HALF THE SKY WAS CLOUDED IN THE OTHER HALF THE STARS SPARKLED ICILY IN THE KEEN FROSTY AIR WHILE EVERYWHERE THE GLORIOUS WEALTH OF SNOW
4362-15663-0021 FELL AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE CONE IN FLOWING FOLDS MORE EXTENSIVE AND CONTINUOUS THAN ANY I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE WHEN DAY DAWNED THE CLOUDS WERE CRAWLING SLOWLY AND BECOMING MORE MASSIVE BUT GAVE NO INTIMATION OF IMMEDIATE DANGER
4362-15663-0022 IN BLANK EXPOSURE TO THE DEEP UPPER CURRENTS OF THE SKY AND NO LABYRINTH OF PEAKS AND CANYONS I HAD EVER BEEN IN SEEMED TO ME SO DANGEROUS AS THESE IMMENSE SLOPES BARE AGAINST THE SKY
4362-15663-0023 THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
4362-15663-0024 I FREQUENTLY SANK TO MY ARMPITS BETWEEN BURIED BLOCKS OF LOOSE LAVA BUT GENERALLY ONLY TO MY KNEES WHEN TIRED WITH WALKING I STILL WALLOWED SLOWLY UPWARD ON ALL FOURS THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE
4362-15663-0025 THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IN SOME PLACES MADE ANY KIND OF PROGRESS FATIGUING WHILE SMALL AVALANCHES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY SET IN MOTION IN THE STEEPEST PLACES BUT THE BRACING AIR AND THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE SNOWY EXPANSE
4362-15663-0026 THRILLED EVERY NERVE AND MADE ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION IMPOSSIBLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING AND WALLOWING IN A CLOUD BUT HOLDING STEADILY ONWARD BY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK I HAD GAINED THE HIGHEST SUMMIT
4362-15663-0027 I HELD MY COMMANDING FOOTHOLD IN THE SKY FOR TWO HOURS GAZING ON THE GLORIOUS LANDSCAPES SPREAD MAPLIKE AROUND THE IMMENSE HORIZON AND TRACING THE OUTLINES OF THE ANCIENT LAVA STREAMS EXTENDING FAR INTO THE SURROUNDING PLAINS
4362-15663-0028 AND THE PATHWAYS OF VANISHED GLACIERS OF WHICH SHASTA HAD BEEN THE CENTER BUT AS I HAD LEFT MY COAT IN CAMP FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MY LIMBS FREE IN CLIMBING I SOON WAS COLD THE WIND INCREASED IN VIOLENCE
4362-15663-0029 RAISING THE SNOW IN MAGNIFICENT DRIFTS THAT WERE DRAWN OUT IN THE FORM OF WAVERING BANNERS BLOWING IN THE SUN TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CLOUDS STRUCK AGAINST THE SUMMIT ROCKS LIKE DRIFTING ICEBERGS
4362-15663-0030 DARKENING THE AIR AS THEY PASSED AND PRODUCING A CHILL AS DEFINITE AND SUDDEN AS IF ICE WATER HAD BEEN DASHED IN MY FACE THIS IS THE KIND OF CLOUD IN WHICH SNOW FLOWERS GROW AND I TURNED AND FLED
4362-15663-0031 I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
4362-15663-0032 HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
4362-15663-0033 UNDULATING HILL AND DALE SMOOTH PURPLE PLAINS AND SILVERY MOUNTAINS OF CUMULI RANGE OVER RANGE DIVERSIFIED WITH PEAK AND DOME AND HOLLOW FULLY BROUGHT OUT IN LIGHT AND SHADE I GAZED ENCHANTED
4362-15663-0034 BUT COLD GRAY MASSES DRIFTING LIKE DUST ON A WIND SWEPT PLAIN BEGAN TO SHUT OUT THE LIGHT FORERUNNERS OF THE COMING STORM I HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUSLY WATCHING I MADE HASTE TO GATHER AS MUCH WOOD AS POSSIBLE
4362-15663-0035 THE STORM SIDE OF MY BLANKETS WAS FASTENED DOWN WITH STAKES TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SIFTING IN OF DRIFT AND THE DANGER OF BEING BLOWN AWAY THE PRECIOUS BREAD SACK WAS PLACED SAFELY AS A PILLOW AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE FIRST FLAKES FELL
4362-15663-0036 I WAS EXULTINGLY READY TO WELCOME THEM MOST OF MY FIREWOOD WAS MORE THAN HALF ROSIN AND WOULD BLAZE IN THE FACE OF THE FIERCEST DRIFTING THE WINDS COULD NOT DEMOLISH MY BED AND MY BREAD COULD BE MADE TO LAST INDEFINITELY
4362-15663-0037 WHILE IN CASE OF NEED I HAD THE MEANS OF MAKING SNOWSHOES AND COULD RETREAT OR HOLD MY GROUND AS I PLEASED PRESENTLY THE STORM BROKE FORTH INTO FULL SNOWY BLOOM AND THE THRONGING CRYSTALS DARKENED THE AIR
4362-15663-0038 THE WIND SWEPT PAST IN HISSING FLOODS GRINDING THE SNOW INTO MEAL AND SWEEPING DOWN INTO THE HOLLOWS IN ENORMOUS DRIFTS ALL THE HEAVIER PARTICLES WHILE THE FINER DUST WAS SIFTED THROUGH THE SKY INCREASING THE ICY GLOOM
4362-15663-0039 AND THE PASSIONATE UPROAR PRODUCED A GLAD EXCITEMENT DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM CONTINUED PILING SNOW ON SNOW IN WEARILESS ABUNDANCE
4362-15663-0040 AS IF TO KNOW HOW THE WORK WAS ADVANCING DURING THESE CALM INTERVALS I REPLENISHED MY FIRE SOMETIMES WITHOUT LEAVING THE NEST FOR FIRE AND WOODPILE WERE SO NEAR THIS COULD EASILY BE DONE OR BUSIED MYSELF WITH MY NOTEBOOK
4362-15663-0041 WATCHING THE GESTURES OF THE TREES IN TAKING THE SNOW EXAMINING SEPARATE CRYSTALS UNDER A LENS AND LEARNING THE METHODS OF THEIR DEPOSITION AS AN ENDURING FOUNTAIN FOR THE STREAMS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE STORM CEASED FOR A FEW MINUTES
4362-15663-0042 A DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAME FRISKING FROM THE FOOT OF A CLUMP OF DWARF PINES MOVING IN SUDDEN INTERRUPTED SPURTS OVER THE BOSSY SNOW THEN WITHOUT ANY APPARENT GUIDANCE HE WOULD DIG RAPIDLY INTO THE DRIFT WHERE WERE BURIED SOME GRAINS OF BARLEY THAT THE HORSES HAD LEFT
4362-15663-0043 THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL DOES NOT STRICTLY BELONG TO THESE UPPER WOODS AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM OUT IN SUCH WEATHER THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP ALSO QUITE A LARGE FLOCK OF THEM CAME TO MY CAMP AND TOOK SHELTER BESIDE A CLUMP OF MATTED DWARF PINES
4362-15663-0044 AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
4362-15663-0045 I SAW AND FELT STILL MORE OF THE SHASTA SNOW FOR THEN IT WAS MY FORTUNE TO GET INTO THE VERY HEART OF A STORM AND TO BE HELD IN IT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
4362-15663-0046 THE DAY INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO ASCENTS BEING DEVOTED TO ESTABLISHING A CAMP ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE TIMBERLINE HERE ON OUR RED TRACHYTE BED WE OBTAINED TWO HOURS OF SHALLOW SLEEP BROKEN FOR OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE KEEN STARRY NIGHT
4362-15663-0047 AT TWO O'CLOCK WE ROSE BREAKFASTED ON A WARMED TIN CUPFUL OF COFFEE AND A PIECE OF FROZEN VENISON BROILED ON THE COALS AND STARTED FOR THE SUMMIT UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF A STORM
4362-15663-0048 BUT ON GAINING THE SUMMIT WE SAW TOWARD LASSEN'S BUTTE HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF WHITE CUMULI BOILING DREAMILY IN THE SUNSHINE FAR BENEATH US AND CAUSING NO ALARM THE SLIGHT WEARINESS OF THE ASCENT WAS SOON RESTED AWAY
4362-15663-0049 AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
4362-15663-0050 PROBABLY INFLUENCED SOMEWHAT BY RADIATION FROM THE SUN WARMED CLIFFS A COMMON BUMBLEBEE NOT AT ALL BENUMBED ZIGZAGGED VIGOROUSLY ABOUT OUR HEADS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE NEAREST HONEY FLOWER WAS A MILE BENEATH HIM
4362-15663-0051 IN THE MEAN TIME CLOUDS WERE GROWING DOWN IN SHASTA VALLEY MASSIVE SWELLING CUMULI DISPLAYING DELICIOUS TONES OF PURPLE AND GRAY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THEIR SUN BEATEN BOSSES EXTENDING GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF SHASTA
4362-15663-0052 THESE AT LENGTH UNITED WITH THE OLDER FIELD TOWARDS LASSEN'S BUTTE THUS ENCIRCLING MOUNT SHASTA IN ONE CONTINUOUS CLOUD ZONE RHETT AND KLAMATH LAKES WERE ECLIPSED BENEATH CLOUDS SCARCELY LESS BRILLIANT THAN THEIR OWN SILVERY DISKS
4362-15663-0053 THE MODOC LAVA BEDS MANY A SNOW LADEN PEAK FAR NORTH IN OREGON THE SCOTT AND TRINITY AND SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS THE PEAKS OF THE SIERRA THE BLUE COAST RANGE SHASTA VALLEY THE DARK FORESTS FILLING THE VALLEY OF THE SACRAMENTO
4362-15663-0054 THE CREATIVE SUN SHONE GLORIOUS ON THE VAST EXPANSE OF CLOUDLAND HILL AND DALE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY SPRINGING INTO EXISTENCE RESPONSIVE TO HIS RAYS AND STEADILY DEVELOPING IN BEAUTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
4362-15663-0055 ON THE CONTRARY THEY IMPRESSED ONE AS BEING LASTING ADDITIONS TO THE LANDSCAPE THE WEATHER OF THE SPRINGTIME AND SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA IN GENERAL IS USUALLY VARIED BY SLIGHT LOCAL RAINS AND DUSTINGS OF SNOW
4362-15663-0056 MOST OF WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY FAR TOO JOYOUS AND LIFE GIVING TO BE REGARDED AS STORMS SINGLE CLOUDS GROWING IN THE SUNNY SKY RIPENING IN AN HOUR SHOWERING THE HEATED LANDSCAPE AND PASSING AWAY LIKE A THOUGHT
4362-15663-0057 ASSUMING A VIOLENCE AND ENERGY OF EXPRESSION SCARCELY SURPASSED BY THOSE BRED IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER SUCH WAS THE STORM NOW GATHERING ABOUT US IT BEGAN TO DECLARE ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER NOON
4362-15663-0058 SUGGESTING TO US THE IDEA OF AT ONCE SEEKING OUR SAFE CAMP IN THE TIMBER AND ABANDONING THE PURPOSE OF MAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE BAROMETER AT THREE P M TWO HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE
4362-15663-0059 WHILE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT STRAWBERRY VALLEY JEROME PEERED AT SHORT INTERVALS OVER THE RIDGE CONTEMPLATING THE RISING CLOUDS WITH ANXIOUS GESTURES IN THE ROUGH WIND AND AT LENGTH DECLARED THAT IF WE DID NOT MAKE A SPEEDY ESCAPE
4362-15663-0060 WE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PASS THE REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT BUT ANXIETY TO COMPLETE MY OBSERVATIONS STIFLED MY OWN INSTINCTIVE PROMPTINGS TO RETREAT AND HELD ME TO MY WORK NO INEXPERIENCED PERSON WAS DEPENDING ON ME
4362-15663-0061 AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
4362-15663-0062 DRAWN OUT IN LONG FAIRY WEBS LIKE CARDED WOOL FORMING AND DISSOLVING AS IF BY MAGIC THE WIND TWISTED THEM INTO RINGLETS AND WHIRLED THEM IN A SUCCESSION OF GRACEFUL CONVOLUTIONS LIKE THE OUTSIDE SPRAYS OF YOSEMITE FALLS IN FLOOD TIME
4362-15663-0063 THEN SAILING OUT INTO THE THIN AZURE OVER THE PRECIPITOUS BRINK OF THE RIDGE THEY WERE DRIFTED TOGETHER LIKE WREATHS OF FOAM ON A RIVER THESE HIGHER AND FINER CLOUD FABRICS
4362-15663-0064 ILL DEFINED EMBANKMENT FROM THE ICY MESHES OF WHICH SNOW FLOWERS BEGAN TO FALL ALTERNATING WITH HAIL THE SKY SPEEDILY DARKENED AND JUST AS I HAD COMPLETED MY LAST OBSERVATION AND BOXED MY INSTRUMENTS READY FOR THE DESCENT
4362-15663-0065 THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
4362-15663-0066 YET SEEMINGLY THROWN AWAY ON THOSE DESOLATE CRAGS DOWN WHICH THEY WENT ROLLING FALLING SLIDING IN A NETWORK OF CURIOUS STREAMS AFTER WE HAD FORCED OUR WAY DOWN THE RIDGE AND PAST THE GROUP OF HISSING FUMAROLES
4362-15663-0067 THE STORM BECAME INCONCEIVABLY VIOLENT THE THERMOMETER FELL TWENTY TWO DEGREES IN A FEW MINUTES AND SOON DROPPED BELOW ZERO THE HAIL GAVE PLACE TO SNOW AND DARKNESS CAME ON LIKE NIGHT THE WIND RISING TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF VIOLENCE
4362-15663-0068 BOOMED AND SURGED AMID THE DESOLATE CRAGS LIGHTNING FLASHES IN QUICK SUCCESSION CUT THE GLOOMY DARKNESS AND THE THUNDERS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY LOUD AND APPALLING I EVER HEARD MADE AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS ROAR
4362-15663-0069 STROKE FOLLOWING STROKE IN QUICK PASSIONATE SUCCESSION AS THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN WERE BEING RENT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND THE FIRES OF THE OLD VOLCANO WERE BREAKING FORTH AGAIN COULD WE AT ONCE HAVE BEGUN TO DESCEND THE SNOW SLOPES LEADING TO THE TIMBER
4362-15663-0070 WE MIGHT HAVE MADE GOOD OUR ESCAPE HOWEVER DARK AND WILD THE STORM AS IT WAS WE HAD FIRST TO MAKE OUR WAY ALONG A DANGEROUS RIDGE NEARLY A MILE AND A HALF LONG FLANKED IN MANY PLACES BY STEEP ICE SLOPES AT THE HEAD OF THE WHITNEY GLACIER ON ONE SIDE
4362-15663-0071 TO LET JEROME WHO HAD FALLEN A LITTLE BEHIND COME UP HERE HE OPENED A COUNCIL IN WHICH UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EXCITING BUT WITHOUT EVINCING ANY BEWILDERMENT HE MAINTAINED IN OPPOSITION TO MY VIEWS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED
4362-15663-0072 HE FIRMLY REFUSED TO MAKE THE VENTURE TO FIND THE CAMP WHILE I AWARE OF THE DANGERS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY ATTEND OUR EFFORTS AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING THE CAUSE OF HIS PRESENT PERIL DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIM OUR DISCUSSIONS ENDED
4362-15663-0073 JEROME MADE A DASH FROM THE SHELTER OF THE LAVA BLOCK AND BEGAN FORCING HIS WAY BACK AGAINST THE WIND TO THE HOT SPRINGS WAVERING AND STRUGGLING TO RESIST BEING CARRIED AWAY AS IF HE WERE FORDING A RAPID STREAM
4362-15663-0074 AFTER WAITING AND WATCHING IN VAIN FOR SOME FLAW IN THE STORM THAT MIGHT BE URGED AS A NEW ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF ATTEMPTING THE DESCENT I WAS COMPELLED TO FOLLOW HERE SAID JEROME AS WE SHIVERED IN THE MIDST OF THE HISSING SPUTTERING FUMAROLES
4362-15663-0075 EVEN AFTER THE STORM IS OVER WE SHALL HAVE TO WAIT FOR SUNSHINE AND WHEN WILL IT COME THE TEMPERED AREA TO WHICH WE HAD COMMITTED OURSELVES EXTENDED OVER ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF AN ACRE
4362-15663-0076 BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOR THE SCALDING GAS JETS WERE SHORN OFF CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY THE OVERSWEEPING FLOOD OF FROSTY WIND AND HOW LAVISHLY THE SNOW FELL ONLY MOUNTAINEERS MAY KNOW THE CRISP CRYSTAL FLOWERS
4362-15663-0077 SEEMED TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND FAIRLY TO THICKEN THE TREMENDOUS BLAST THAT CARRIED THEM THIS WAS THE BLOOM TIME THE SUMMER OF THE CLOUD AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN EVEN A MOUNTAIN CLOUD FLOWERING SO PROFUSELY
4362-15663-0078 WHEN THE BLOOM OF THE SHASTA CHAPARRAL IS FALLING THE GROUND IS SOMETIMES COVERED FOR HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES TO A DEPTH OF HALF AN INCH BUT THE BLOOM OF THIS FERTILE SNOW CLOUD GREW AND MATURED AND FELL TO A DEPTH OF TWO FEET IN A FEW HOURS
4362-15663-0079 SOME CRYSTALS LANDED WITH THEIR RAYS ALMOST PERFECT BUT MOST OF THEM WERE WORN AND BROKEN BY STRIKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OR BY ROLLING ON THE GROUND THE TOUCH OF THESE SNOW FLOWERS IN CALM WEATHER IS INFINITELY GENTLE GLINTING SWAYING
4362-15663-0080 SETTLING SILENTLY IN THE DRY MOUNTAIN AIR OR MASSED IN FLAKES SOFT AND DOWNY TO LIE OUT ALONE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF A STILL NIGHT AND BE TOUCHED BY THE FIRST OF THESE SMALL SILENT MESSENGERS FROM THE SKY IS A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE
4362-15663-0081 AND THE FINENESS OF THAT TOUCH NONE WILL FORGET BUT THE STORM BLAST LADEN WITH CRISP SHARP SNOW SEEMS TO CRUSH AND BRUISE AND STUPEFY WITH ITS MULTITUDE OF STINGS AND COMPELS THE BRAVEST TO TURN AND FLEE
4362-15663-0082 A WEAVING OF TRANSLUCENT TISSUE ABOVE THEN THE ROAR OF THE WIND AND THE THUNDER AND THE DARKENING FLIGHT OF SNOW ITS SUBSIDENCE WAS NOT LESS SUDDEN THE CLOUDS BROKE AND VANISHED NOT A CRYSTAL WAS LEFT IN THE SKY
4362-15663-0083 AND IN MANY PLACES REACHED THE SKIN WE WERE GLAD AT FIRST TO SEE THE SNOW PACKING ABOUT US HOPING IT WOULD DEADEN THE FORCE OF THE WIND BUT IT SOON FROZE INTO A STIFF CRUSTY HEAP AS THE TEMPERATURE FELL RATHER AUGMENTING OUR NOVEL MISERY
4362-15663-0084 IN OUR FROZEN AND BROILED CONDITION SEEMED CERTAIN DEATH THE ACRID INCRUSTATIONS SUBLIMED FROM THE ESCAPING GASES FREQUENTLY GAVE WAY OPENING NEW VENTS TO SCALD US AND FEARING THAT IF AT ANY TIME THE WIND SHOULD FALL
4362-15663-0085 MIGHT COLLECT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO CAUSE SLEEP AND DEATH
4362-15663-0086 EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
4362-15663-0087 EACH FEARING THE OTHER MIGHT BE BENUMBED OR DEAD THE ORDINARY SENSATIONS OF COLD GIVE BUT A FAINT CONCEPTION OF THAT WHICH COMES ON AFTER HARD CLIMBING WITH WANT OF FOOD AND SLEEP IN SUCH EXPOSURE AS THIS LIFE IS THEN SEEN TO BE A FIRE
4362-15663-0088 THAT NOW SMOULDERS NOW BRIGHTENS AND MAY BE EASILY QUENCHED THE WEARY HOURS WORE AWAY LIKE DIM HALF FORGOTTEN YEARS SO LONG AND EVENTFUL THEY SEEMED THOUGH WE DID NOTHING BUT SUFFER
4362-15663-0089 STILL THE PAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS OF THAT BITTER INTENSE KIND THAT PRECLUDES THOUGHT AND TAKES AWAY ALL CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT A SORT OF DREAMY STUPOR CAME ON AT TIMES
4362-15663-0090 IN WHICH WE FANCIED WE SAW DRY RESINOUS LOGS SUITABLE FOR CAMPFIRES JUST AS AFTER GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD MEN FANCY THEY SEE BREAD FROZEN BLISTERED FAMISHED BENUMBED OUR BODIES SEEMED LOST TO US AT TIMES
4362-15663-0091 SHINING WITH MARVELOUS BRIGHTNESS WITH LONG LANCE RAYS NEAR LOOKING AND NEW LOOKING AS IF NEVER SEEN BEFORE AGAIN THEY WOULD LOOK FAMILIAR AND REMIND US OF STARGAZING AT HOME OFTENTIMES IMAGINATION COMING INTO PLAY
4362-15663-0092 THE FROST GREW MORE AND MORE INTENSE AND WE BECAME ICY AND COVERED OVER WITH A CRUST OF FROZEN SNOW
4362-15663-0093 IN ABOUT THIRTEEN HOURS EVERY HOUR LIKE A YEAR DAY BEGAN TO DAWN BUT IT WAS LONG ERE THE SUMMIT'S ROCKS WERE TOUCHED BY THE SUN NO CLOUDS WERE VISIBLE FROM WHERE WE LAY YET THE MORNING WAS DULL AND BLUE AND BITTERLY FROSTY
4362-15663-0094 AND HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED BY WHILE WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE PALE LIGHT STEALING DOWN THE RIDGE TO THE HOLLOW WHERE WE LAY BUT THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF THAT WARM FLUSHING SUNRISE SPLENDOR WE SO LONG HAD HOPED FOR
4362-15663-0095 AS THE TIME DREW NEAR TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO REACH CAMP WE BECAME CONCERNED TO KNOW WHAT STRENGTH WAS LEFT US AND WHETHER OR NO WE COULD WALK FOR WE HAD LAIN FLAT ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT ONCE RISING TO OUR FEET
4362-15663-0096 MOUNTAINEERS HOWEVER ALWAYS FIND IN THEMSELVES A RESERVE OF POWER AFTER GREAT EXHAUSTION IT IS A KIND OF SECOND LIFE AVAILABLE ONLY IN EMERGENCIES LIKE THIS AND HAVING PROVED ITS EXISTENCE I HAD NO GREAT FEAR THAT EITHER OF US WOULD FAIL
4362-15663-0097 AT LENGTH AFTER THE TEMPERATURE WAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED ON THIS MEMORABLE FIRST OF MAY WE AROSE AND BEGAN TO STRUGGLE HOMEWARD OUR FROZEN TROUSERS COULD SCARCELY BE MADE TO BEND AT THE KNEE AND WE WADED THE SNOW WITH DIFFICULTY
4362-15663-0098 THE SUMMIT RIDGE WAS FORTUNATELY WIND SWEPT AND NEARLY BARE SO WE WERE NOT COMPELLED TO LIFT OUR FEET HIGH AND ON REACHING THE LONG HOME SLOPES LADEN WITH LOOSE SNOW WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS SLIDING AND SHUFFLING AND PITCHING HEADLONG
4362-15663-0099 OUR FEEBLENESS ACCELERATING RATHER THAN DIMINISHING OUR SPEED WHEN WE HAD DESCENDED SOME THREE THOUSAND FEET THE SUNSHINE WARMED OUR BACKS AND WE BEGAN TO REVIVE AT TEN A M WE REACHED THE TIMBER AND WERE SAFE
4362-15663-0100 HALF AN HOUR LATER WE HEARD SISSON SHOUTING DOWN AMONG THE FIRS COMING WITH HORSES TO TAKE US TO THE HOTEL AFTER BREAKING A TRAIL THROUGH THE SNOW AS FAR AS POSSIBLE HE HAD TIED HIS ANIMALS AND WALKED UP WE HAD BEEN SO LONG WITHOUT FOOD
4362-15663-0101 THAT WE CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT EATING BUT WE EAGERLY DRANK THE COFFEE HE PREPARED FOR US OUR FEET WERE FROZEN AND THAWING THEM WAS PAINFUL AND HAD TO BE DONE VERY SLOWLY BY KEEPING THEM BURIED IN SOFT SNOW FOR SEVERAL HOURS
4362-15663-0102 WHICH AVOIDED PERMANENT DAMAGE FIVE THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT WE FOUND ONLY THREE INCHES OF NEW SNOW AND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN ONLY A SLIGHT SHOWER OF RAIN HAD FALLEN SHOWING HOW LOCAL OUR STORM HAD BEEN
4362-15663-0103 NOTWITHSTANDING ITS TERRIFIC FURY OUR FEET WERE WRAPPED IN SACKING AND WE WERE SOON MOUNTED AND ON OUR WAY DOWN INTO THE THICK SUNSHINE GOD'S COUNTRY AS SISSON CALLS THE CHAPARRAL ZONE
4362-15663-0104 HOW BEAUTIFUL SEEMED THE GOLDEN SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE WOODS BETWEEN THE WARM BROWN BOLES OF THE CEDARS AND PINES ALL MY FRIENDS AMONG THE BIRDS AND PLANTS SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS AND WE FELT LIKE SPEAKING TO EVERY ONE OF THEM AS WE PASSED
4362-15663-0105 AS IF WE HAD BEEN A LONG TIME AWAY IN SOME FAR STRANGE COUNTRY IN THE AFTERNOON WE REACHED STRAWBERRY VALLEY AND FELL ASLEEP NEXT MORNING WE SEEMED TO HAVE RISEN FROM THE DEAD MY BEDROOM WAS FLOODED WITH SUNSHINE
4362-15663-0106 AND FROM THE WINDOW I SAW THE GREAT WHITE SHASTA CONE CLAD IN FORESTS AND CLOUDS AND BEARING THEM LOFTILY IN THE SKY EVERYTHING SEEMED FULL AND RADIANT WITH THE FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH
2691-156755-0000 CAPTAIN FRISBIE WEDDING FESTIVITIES THE MASTERPIECE OF GRANDMA'S YOUTH SENORA VALLEJO JAKIE'S RETURN HIS DEATH A CHEROKEE INDIAN WHO HAD STOOD BY MY FATHER'S GRAVE
2691-156755-0001 CAPTAIN FRISBIE SPENT MUCH TIME IN SONOMA AFTER COMPANY H WAS DISBANDED AND OBSERVING ONES REMARKED THAT THE ATTRACTION WAS MISS FANNIE VALLEJO YET NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE DID THE GENERAL CONSENT TO PART WITH HIS FIRST BORN DAUGHTER
2691-156755-0002 SHE ANTICIPATED THE COMING EVENT WITH INTEREST AND PLEASURE BECAUSE THE PROLONGED AND BRILLIANT FESTIVITIES WOULD AFFORD HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISPLAY HER FANCY AND TALENT IN BUTTER MODELLING FOR THE WORK SHE DID NOT CHARGE
2691-156755-0003 IN THE EVENINGS AFTER CANDLE LIGHT WE THREE GATHERED HER IMPLEMENTS WERE A CIRCULAR HARDWOOD BOARD A PADDLE A SET OF SMALL WELL POINTED STICKS
2691-156755-0004 SHE TALKED AND MODELLED AND WE LISTENING WATCHED THE FASCINATING PROCESS SAW HER TAKE THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE FASHION A DUCK WITH DUCKLINGS ON A POND A LAMB CURLED UP ASLEEP
2691-156755-0005 AND A COUCHED LION WITH SHAGGY HEAD RESTING UPON HIS FORE PAWS WE WATCHED HER PRESS BEADS OF PROPER SIZE AND COLOR INTO THE EYE SOCKETS SKILFULLY FINISH THE BASE UPON WHICH EACH FIGURE LAY
2691-156755-0006 THEN TWIST A LUMP OF BUTTER INTO A SQUARE OF FINE MUSLIN AND DEFTLY SQUEEZE UNTIL IT CRINKLED THROUGH THE MESHES IN FORM OF FLEECE FOR THE LAMB'S COAT
2691-156755-0007 THEN USE A DIFFERENT MESH TO PRODUCE THE STRANDS FOR THE LION'S MANE AND THE TUFT FOR THE END OF HIS TAIL IN EXUBERANT DELIGHT WE EXCLAIMED OH GRANDMA HOW DID YOU LEARN TO MAKE SUCH WONDERFUL THINGS
2691-156755-0008 I DID NOT LEARN IT IS A GIFT SHE REPLIED THEN SHE SPOKE OF HER MODELLING IN CHILDHOOD AND HER SUBSEQUENT MASTERPIECE WHICH HAD WON THE COMMENDATION OF NAPOLEON AND EMPRESS JOSEPHINE AT THAT AUSPICIOUS TIME SHE WAS BUT EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
2691-156755-0009 AND SECOND COOK IN THE PRINCIPAL TAVERN OF NEUCHATEL SWITZERLAND GEORGIA AND I SAT ENTRANCED AS WITH ANIMATED WORDS AND GESTURES SHE PICTURED THE APPEARANCE OF THE BUGLERS AND HERALDS WHO CAME WEEKS IN ADVANCE
2691-156755-0010 AND EMPRESS WOULD ARRIVE IN THAT TOWN AND DINE AT THE TAVERN THEN THE EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASTIC PREPARATIONS WHICH FOLLOWED
2691-156755-0011 AND WHAT A CENTREPIECE IT WAS IT REQUIRED THE CAREFUL HANDLING OF NO LESS THAN THREE PERSONS TO GET IT IN PLACE ON THE TABLE WHERE THE EMPEROR MIGHT SEE AT A GLANCE THE GROUPS OF FIGURES ALONG THE SPLENDID HIGHWAY
2691-156755-0012 OF THE SNOW WHITE POODLE SNUGGLED CLOSE IN THE EMPRESS'S ARMS THEN SHE TOLD HOW SHE HEARD A HEAVY THUD BY THE KITCHEN FIRE WHICH MADE HER RUSH BACK ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE HEAD COOK HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR IN A FAINT
2691-156755-0013 SHE GAVE THE QUICK CALL WHICH BROUGHT THE FRAU WIRTHIN TO THE SCENE OF CONFUSION WHERE IN MUTE AGONY SHE LOOKED FROM SERVANT TO SERVANT UNTIL WITH HANDS CLASPED AND EYES FULL OF TEARS SHE IMPLORED MARIE
2691-156755-0014 TAKE THE HIGHER PLACE FOR THE DAY AND WITH GOD'S HELP MAKE NO MISTAKE THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT WHILE THE DINNER WAS BEING SERVED THE EMPEROR ADMIRED THE BUTTER PIECE AND ON HEARING THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF A YOUNG MAIDSERVANT IN THE HOUSE
2691-156755-0015 THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS FROM ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES AND NOT DRESSED FOR PRESENTATION CRIED WITH QUIVERING LIPS
2691-156755-0016 THE GREAT EMPEROR ASKS TO SEE THEE AND THOU MUST COME SHE TOLD HOW POOR RED FACED BEWILDERED MARIE DROPPED HER LADLE AND STARED AT THE SPEAKER
2691-156755-0017 THEN ROLLED DOWN HER SLEEVES WHILE THE FRAU WIRTHIN TIED HER OWN BEST WHITE APRON AROUND HER WAIST AT THE SAME TIME INSTRUCTING HER IN THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE MUST HOLD HER DRESS AT THE SIDES BETWEEN THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND SPREAD THE SKIRT WIDE
2691-156755-0018 YET AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER SHE WAS INFORMED THAT THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS HAD SPOKEN KINDLY TO HER AND THAT SHE HERSELF HAD MADE HER BOW AND BACKED OUT OF THE ROOM ADMIRABLY FOR ONE IN HER POSITION
2691-156755-0019 THE EMPEROR AND THE EMPRESS SHE NOW FINISHED HER MODELLING WITH A DAINTY CENTREPIECE FOR THE BRIDE'S TABLE AND LET ME GO WITH HER WHEN SHE CARRIED IT TO THE VALLEJO MANSION IT GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION AND WHILE THE FAMILY AND GUESTS WERE ADMIRING IT
2691-156755-0020 SENORA VALLEJO TOOK ME BY THE HAND SAYING IN HER OWN MUSICAL TONGUE COME LITTLE DAUGHTER AND PLAY WHILE YOU WAIT SHE LED ME TO A ROOM THAT HAD PICTURES ON THE WALLS AND LEFT ME SURROUNDED BY TOYS BUT I COULD NOT PLAY
2691-156755-0021 MY EYES WANDERED ABOUT UNTIL THEY BECAME RIVETED ON ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM WHERE STOOD A CHILD'S CRIB WHICH LOOKED LIKE GOLD ITS HEAD AND FOOT BOARDS WERE EMBELLISHED WITH FIGURES OF ANGELS
2691-156755-0022 AND A CANOPY OF LACE LIKE A FLEECY CLOUD HOVERED OVER THEM THE BED WAS WHITE BUT THE PILLOWS WERE COVERED WITH PINK SILK AND ENCASED IN SLIPS OF LINEN LAWN EXQUISITE WITH RARE NEEDLEWORK
2691-156755-0023 I TOUCHED IT BEFORE I LEFT THE ROOM WONDERING WHAT THE LITTLE GIRL DREAMED IN THAT BEAUTIFUL BED AND ON THE WAY HOME GRANDMA AND I DISCUSSED ALL THESE THINGS
2691-156755-0024 THE LINEN PILLOW SLIPS WERE AS FINE AS THOSE SENORITA ISABELLA FITCH SHOWED ME WHEN SHE GAVE ME THE FEW HIGHLY PRIZED LESSONS IN SIMPLE DRAWN WORK AND HER COUSIN SENORITA LEESE HAD TAUGHT ME HEMMING
2691-156755-0025 THESE YOUNG LADIES WERE RELATED TO THE VALLEJOS AND ALSO LIVED IN LARGE HOUSES FACING THE PLAZA AND WERE ALWAYS KIND TO GEORGIA AND ME IN FACT SOME OF MY SWEETEST MEMORIES OF SONOMA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THREE SPANISH HOMES
2691-156755-0026 THEIR PEOPLE NEVER ASKED UNFEELING QUESTIONS NOR REPEATED HARROWING TALES AND I DID NOT LEARN UNTIL I WAS GROWN THAT THEY HAD BEEN AMONG THE LARGE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND FOR THE RELIEF OF OUR PARTY
2691-156755-0027 I HAVE A FAINT RECOLLECTION OF LISTENING TO THE CHIMES OF THE WEDDING BELLS AND LATER OF HEARING THAT CAPTAIN FRISBIE HAD TAKEN HIS BRIDE AWAY BUT THAT IS ALL FOR ABOUT THAT TIME DEAR OLD JAKIE RETURNED TO US IN ILL HEALTH AND OUR THOUGHTS AND CARE TURNED TO HIM
2691-156755-0028 I HAVE DONE MY BEST WITH THE MEDICINES AT HAND THE ONLY THING THAT REMAINS TO BE TRIED IS A TEA STEEPED FROM THE NETTLE ROOT THAT MAY GIVE RELIEF AS SOON AS WE COULD GET READY AFTER THE DOCTOR UTTERED THOSE WORDS GEORGIA AND I EQUIPPED WITH HOE
2691-156755-0029 WHILE I CUT THEM OFF AND HOED UP THE ROOTS THE PLANTS TOWERED LUXURIANTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS MAKING THE TASK EXTREMELY PAINFUL
2691-156755-0030 NO SOONER WOULD I COMMENCE OPERATIONS THAN THE BRANCHES SLIPPING FROM UNDER THE STICK WOULD BRUSH GEORGIA'S FACE AND STRIKE MY HANDS AND ARMS WITH STINGING FORCE AND BY THE TIME WE HAD SECURED THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF ROOTS WE WERE COVERED WITH FIERY WELTS
2691-156755-0031 THE ONE IN FRONT STAGGERING AND HIS SQUAW BEHIND MAKING FRANTIC MOTIONS TO US TO HURRY OVER THE SNAKE FENCE NEAR BY THIS WE DID AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE AND SUCCEEDED NONE TOO SOON FOR AS WE REACHED THE GROUND ON THE SAFE SIDE HE STOPPED US
2691-156755-0032 AND ANGRILY DEMANDED THE CONTENTS OF OUR BASKET WE OPENED IT AND WHEN HE SAW WHAT IT CONTAINED HE STAMPED HIS WABBLING FOOT AND MOTIONED US TO BE OFF WE OBEYED WITH ALACRITY FOR IT WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A DRUNKEN INDIAN
2691-156755-0033 AND GREATLY ALARMED US THE TEA MAY HAVE EASED JAKIE'S PAIN BUT IT DID NOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE HAD HOPED
2691-156755-0034 AFTER THE LAWYER WENT AWAY GRANDMA TOLD US THAT JAKIE HAD WILLED US EACH FIFTY DOLLARS IN GOLD AND THE REST OF HIS PROPERTY TO GRANDPA AND HERSELF A FEW WEEKS LATER WHEN THE SAP CEASED FLOWING TO THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND THE YELLOW LEAVES WERE FALLING
2691-156755-0035 GRANDPA HAD THE GRAVE ENCLOSED WITH A WHITE PALING AND WE CHILDREN PLANTED CASTILIAN ROSE BUSHES AT THE HEAD AND FOOT OF THE MOUND AND CARRIED WATER TO THEM FROM THE HOUSE AND IN TIME THEIR BRANCHES MET AND THE GRAVE WAS A BED OF FRAGRANT BLOSSOMS
2691-156755-0036 ONE DAY AS I WAS RETURNING FROM IT WITH MY EMPTY PAIL A TIDY BLACK EYED WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID I'M A CHEROKEE INDIAN THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE THREE DROVERS THAT SOLD THE BRUNNERS THEM LONG HORNED CATTLE THAT WAS DELIVERED THE OTHER DAY

2691-156750-0001 EXCITED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN RUSHED TO TOWN IN QUEST OF INFORMATION IT WAS FURNISHED BY
2691-156750-0002 WHO HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY PRIVATELY TWO WEEKS EARLIER AND HAD JUST RETURNED IN A STATE OF GREAT ENTHUSIASM DECLARING THAT GOLD IN DUST GRAINS AND CHUNKS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AT COLOMA NOT MORE THAN A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM SUTTER'S FORT
2691-156750-0003 HOW SOON CAN WE GET THERE BECAME THE ALL ABSORBING PROBLEM OF EAGER LISTENERS THE ONLY HOTEL KEEPER IN THE TOWN SOLD HIS KETTLES AND PANS CLOSED HIS HOUSE AND DEPARTED

2691-156750-0008 THEY WENT NOT WITH CHEERING WORDS ONLY BUT WITH SOMETHING IN STORE FOR THE EMPTY CUPBOARDS
2691-156750-0009 GRANDMA WAS IN SUCH DEMAND THAT SHE HAD LITTLE TIME TO REST FOR THERE WAS NOT A DOCTOR NOR A MEDICINE SHOP IN THE VALLEY AND HER PARCELS OF HERBS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR USES HAD TO SERVE FOR BOTH NIGHTS SHE SET HER SHOES HANDY
2691-156750-0010 SO THAT SHE COULD DRESS QUICKLY WHEN SUMMONED TO THE SICK AND DAWN OF DAY OFTEN MARKED HER HOME COMING GEORGIA AND I WERE LED INTO HER WORK EARLY FOR WE WERE SENT WITH BROTHS AND APPETIZERS TO THE SICK ON CLEARINGS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCES
2691-156750-0011 AND SHE WOULD BID US STAY A WHILE AT DIFFERENT HOUSES WHERE WE COULD BE HELPFUL BUT TO BE SURE AND BRING CAREFUL REPORTS FROM EACH HOME WE ENTERED UNDER SUCH TRAINING WE LEARNED MUCH ABOUT DISEASES AND THE CARE OF THE SUFFERING ANON
2691-156750-0012 WE WOULD FIND IN THE PLAIN WOODEN CRADLE A DAINTY BUNDLE OF SWEETNESS ALL DONE UP IN WHITE
2691-156750-0013 THEN SHE WOULD METE OUT TO US THAT HARDEST OF PUNISHMENTS NAMELY THAT WE WERE NOT TO SPEAK WITH EACH OTHER UNTIL SHE SHOULD FORGIVE OUR OFFENCE FORGIVENESS USUALLY CAME BEFORE TIME TO DRIVE UP THE COWS
2691-156750-0014 FOR SHE KNEW THAT WE WERE NIMBLER FOOTED WHEN SHE STARTED US OFF IN HAPPY MOOD EACH COW WORE A BELL OF DIFFERENT TONE AND KNEW HER OWN NAME YET IT WAS NOT AN EASY TASK EVEN IN PLEASANT WEATHER TO COLLECT THE VARIOUS STRINGS AND GET THEM HOME ON TIME
2691-156750-0015 THEY MIXED AND FED WITH NEIGHBORS CATTLE ON THE RANGE AND HID THEMSELVES BEHIND CLUMPS OF TREES AND OTHER CONVENIENT OBSTRUCTIONS OFTEN GRANDMA WOULD GET HER STRING IN BY THE MAIN TRAIL AND HAVE THEM MILKED
2691-156750-0016 BEFORE WE COULD BRING UP THE LAGGARDS THAT PROVOKINGLY DAWDLED ALONG NIBBLING STRAY BUNCHES OF GRASS WHEN LATE ON THE ROAD WE SAW COYOTES SNEAKING OUT FOR THEIR EVENING MEAL AND HEARD THE FAR AWAY CRY OF THE PANTHER
2691-156750-0017 BUT WE WERE NOT MUCH AFRAID WHEN IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH SO THAT IMAGINATION COULD NOT PICTURE THEM CREEPING STEALTHILY BEHIND US OUR GALLANT COMPANY C OFFICERED BY CAPTAIN BARTLETT AND LIEUTENANTS STONEMAN AND STONE
2691-156750-0018 TO THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND WHEN CAPTAIN JOE HOOKER BROUGHT HIM OUT TO VISIT GRANDMA'S DAIRY SHE TOO WAS GREATLY PLEASED BY HIS SOLDIERLY BEARING AFTER HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD HEARD OF HER INTEREST IN THE COMPANY WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY

2691-156750-0031 AND AS IT CAME TIME FOR THE FUNERAL WE GATHERED WITH OTHERS ON THE PLAZA WHERE THE PROCESSION FORMED WE WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED THE EMIGRANTS UNCOVERED AND BOWED THEIR HEADS REVERENTLY BUT THE SOLDIERS IN LINE WITH GUNS REVERSED
2691-156750-0032 STOOD ERECT AND MOTIONLESS AS FIGURES IN STONE WHILE THE BIER OF THE DEAD WAS BEING CARRIED THROUGH OPEN RANKS TO THE WAITING CAISSON THE COFFIN WAS COVERED WITH A FLAG AND UPON IT LAY HIS CHAPEAU GAUNTLETS SASH AND SWORD

6848-252323-0013 BILLY AT THE SAME MOMENT TOOK OUT HIS FIDDLE AND BEGAN THAT PROCESS OF PREPARATORY SCREWING AND SCRAPING WHICH NO MATTER HOW DISTRESSING TO THE SURROUNDERS SEEMS TO AFFORD INTENSE DELIGHT TO PERFORMERS ON THIS INSTRUMENT IN THE PRESENT CASE
6848-252323-0014 IT IS BUT FAIR TO SAY THERE WAS NEITHER COMMENT NOR IMPATIENCE ON THE CONTRARY THEY SEEMED TO ACCEPT THESE CONVULSIVE THROES OF SOUND AS AN EARNEST OF THE GRAND FLOOD OF MELODY THAT WAS COMING

6848-252323-0018 IN FACT IT POSSESSED THE GREATEST OF ALL CLAIMS TO THEIR ADMIRATION FOR IT WAS PARTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND BY THE ARTFUL INTRODUCTION OF A WORD HERE AND THERE OF WHICH HIS HEARERS KNEW NOTHING
6848-252323-0019 THE POET WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS SECURING THEIR HEARTIEST APPROVAL NOR WAS BILLY INSENSIBLE TO SUCH FLATTERIES THE IRRITABILE GENUS HAS ITS SOFT SIDE AND CAN ENJOY TO THE UTTERMOST ITS OWN SUCCESSES

6848-252323-0023 CHEAP PENKNIVES AND SCISSORS PENCIL CASES BODKINS AND THE LIKE AND I WANDERED ABOUT FOR WEEKS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE LAKE COUNTRY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE
6848-252323-0024 LIKE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN IRELAND MORE WOOD FOREST TIMBER AND BETTER OFF PEOPLE BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT WELL ONE EVENING IT WAS IN AUGUST I CAME DOWN BY A NARROW PATH TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE WHERE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT
6848-252323-0025 RUNNING OUT INTO THE LAKE AND THERE WAS TWO ISLANDS ALL WOODED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND BEHIND ALL IN THE DISTANCE WAS A GREAT MOUNTAIN WITH CLOUDS ON THE TOP AND IT WAS JUST THE SEASON WHEN THE TREES IS BEGINNIN TO CHANGE THEIR COLORS
6848-252323-0026 AND I STRETCHED MYSELF DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING IT'S OFTEN AND OFTEN I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE ELEGANT FANCIES THAT CAME THROUGH MY HEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I THOUGHT I SAW THAT NIGHT OUT ON THE LAKE FORNINT ME
6848-252323-0027 YE SEE I WAS FRESH AND FASTIN I NEVER TASTED A BIT THE WHOLE DAY AND MY BRAIN MAYBE WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR SOMEHOW JANIUS REAL JANIUS THRIVES BEST ON A LITTLE STARVATION AND FROM MUSING
6848-252323-0028 AND BLENDED IN WITH THE SLIGHT SPLASH OF OARS THAT MOVED THROUGH THE WATER CAREFULLY AS THOUGH NOT TO LOSE A WORD OF HIM THAT WAS SPEAKIN IT'S CLEAN BEYOND ME TO TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID AND MAYBE IF I COULD
6848-252323-0029 FOR HE WAS DISCOORSIN ABOUT NIGHT AND THE MOON AND ALL THAT VARIOUS POETS SAID ABOUT THEM YE'D THINK THAT HE HAD BOOKS AND WAS READING OUT OF THEM SO GLIBLY CAME THE VERSES FROM HIS LIPS I NEVER LISTENED TO SUCH A VOICE BEFORE SO SOFT SO SWEET
6848-252323-0030 SO MUSICAL AND THE WORDS CAME DROPPIN DOWN LIKE THE CLEAR WATER FILTERIN OVER A ROCKY LEDGE AND GLITTERIN LIKE LITTLE SPANGLES OVER MOSS AND WILD FLOWERS IT WASN'T ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT SCOTCH BALLADS TOO AND ONCE OR TWICE IN ITALIAN THAT HE RECITED
6848-252323-0031 TILL AT LAST HE GAVE OUT IN ALL THE FULNESS OF HIS LIQUID VOICE THEM ELEGANT LINES OUT OF POPE'S HOMER AS WHEN THE MOON REFULGENT LAMP OF NIGHT O'ER HEAVEN'S CLEAR AZURE SPREADS HER SACRED LIGHT
6848-252323-0032 WHEN NOT A BREATH DISTURBS THE DEEP SERENE AND NOT A CLOUD O'ERCASTS THE SOLEMN SCENE AROUND HER THRONE THE VIVID PLANETS ROLL AND STARS UNNUMBERED GILD THE GLOWING POLE O'ER THE DARK TREES A YELLOWER VERDURE SHED
6848-252323-0033 AND TOP WITH SILVER EVERY MOUNTAIN'S HEAD THEN SHINE THE VALES THE ROCKS IN PROSPECT RISE A FLOOD OF GLORY BURSTS FROM ALL THE SKIES THE CONSCIOUS SWAINS REJOICING IN THE SIGHT
6848-252323-0034 EYE THE BLUE VAULT AND BLESS THE USEFUL LIGHT THE LORD FORGIVE ME BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE LAST WORDS AND SAID USEFUL LIGHT I COULDN'T RESTRAIN MYSELF BUT BROKE OUT THAT'S MIGHTY LIKE A BULL ANYHOW
6848-252323-0035 IS IT YOU SAID HE WITH A QUIET LAUGH THAT ACCUSES POPE OF A BULL IT IS SAYS I AND WHAT'S MORE THERE ISN'T A POET FROM HORACE DOWNWARDS THAT I WON'T SHOW BULLS IN THERE'S BULLS IN SHAKSPEARE AND IN MILTON
6848-252323-0036 THERE'S BULLS IN THE ANCIENTS I LL POINT OUT A BULL IN ARISTOPHANES WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID HE TURNING TO THE OTHERS A POOR CRAYTURE SAYS I LIKE GOLDSMITH'S CHEST OF DRAWERS
6848-252323-0037 WITH BRAINS REDUCED A DOABLE DEBT TO PAY TO DREAM BY NIGHT SELL SHEFFIELD WARE BY DAY WELL WITH THAT HE TOOK A FIT OF LAUGHING AND HANDING THE REST OUT OF THE BOAT
6848-252323-0038 HE MADE ME COME ALONG AT HIS SIDE DISCOORSIN ME ABOUT MY THRAVELS AND ALL I SEEN AND ALL I READ TILL WE REACHED AN ELEGANT LITTLE COTTAGE ON A BANK RIGHT OVER THE LAKE AND THEN HE BROUGHT ME IN AND MADE ME TAKE TAY WITH THE FAMILY AND I SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
6848-252323-0039 AND FOR MANY AN HOUR AFTERWARDS WHEN I JUST THINK OVER THEIR KIND WORDS AND PLEASANT FACES MORE THAN ONE OF THE COMPANY HAD DROPPED OFF ASLEEP DURING BILLY'S NARRATIVE AND OF THE OTHERS THEIR COMPLAISANCE AS LISTENERS APPEARED TAXED TO THE UTMOST
6848-252323-0040 WHILE THE CORPORAL SNORED LOUDLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAD A RIGHT TO INDULGE HIMSELF TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THERE'S THE BELL AGAIN MUTTERED ONE THAT'S FROM THE LORD'S ROOM AND CRAGGS STARTING UP BY THE INSTINCT OF HIS OFFICE HASTENED OFF
6848-76049-0000 TWO GENTLEMEN WERE COMING TOWARDS HER ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WHOSE MINDS IT CHANCED WERE VERY BUSILY OCCUPIED BY HER AFFAIRS ONE OF THESE WAS HER FATHER WHO WAS LYING IN HIS BRASS BED IN HIS COMMODIOUS CABIN ON THE HOLLANDIA
6848-76049-0001 REGRETTING HIS DIMINISHING ABILITY TO SLEEP IN THE EARLY MORNING NOW EVEN WHEN HE WAS IN THE STRONG AND SOOTHING AIR OF MID ATLANTIC AND THINKING OF V V BECAUSE SHE HAD A WAY OF COMING INTO HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS UNDEFENDED
6848-76049-0002 AND THE OTHER WAS MISTER GUNTER LAKE ON THE MEGANTIC ONE DAY OUT FROM SANDY HOOK WHO FOUND HIMSELF EQUALLY SLEEPLESS AND PREOCCUPIED AND ALTHOUGH MISTER LAKE WAS A MAN OF VAST ACTIVITIES AND COMPLICATED ENGAGEMENTS
6848-76049-0003 HE WAS COMING NOW TO EUROPE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF SEEING V V AND HAVING THINGS OUT WITH HER FULLY AND COMPLETELY BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SHE MADE SUCH AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DELAYS IN COMING TO AMERICA
6848-76049-0004 OLD GRAMMONT AS HE APPEARED UPON THE PILLOW OF HIS BED BY THE LIGHT OF A ROSE SHADED BEDSIDE LAMP WAS A SMALL HEADED GREY HAIRED GENTLEMAN WITH A WRINKLED FACE AND SUNKEN BROWN EYES YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
6848-76049-0005 MITIGATED ONLY BY SUCH EXERCISE AS THE GAME OF POKER AFFORDS HAD INTENSIFIED AN INSTINCTIVE INEXPRESSIVENESS UNDER THE MOST SOLITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OLD GRAMMONT WAS STILL INEXPRESSIVE
6848-76049-0006 HE WAS NOT EVEN TRYING TO SLEEP WHY HE MEDITATED HAD V V STAYED ON IN EUROPE SO MUCH LONGER THAN SHE NEED HAVE DONE AND WHY HAD GUNTER LAKE SUDDENLY GOT INTO A STATE OF MIND ABOUT HER
6848-76049-0007 WHY DIDN'T THE GIRL CONFIDE IN HER FATHER AT LEAST ABOUT THESE THINGS WHAT WAS AFOOT SHE HAD THROWN OVER LAKE ONCE AND IT SEEMED SHE WAS GOING TO TURN HIM DOWN AGAIN WELL
6848-76049-0008 WHATEVER ELSE YOU CALLED HER AND NO ONE COULD CALL GRAMMONT BLOOD ALL ORDINARY FLUID OLD GRAMMONT HAD NEVER HAD ANY DELUSIONS ABOUT LAKE IF LAKE'S FATHER HADN'T BEEN A BIG MAN
6848-76049-0009 LAKE WOULD NEVER HAVE COUNTED FOR ANYTHING AT ALL SUPPOSE SHE DID TURN HIM DOWN IN ITSELF THAT WASN'T A THING TO BREAK HER FATHER'S HEART WHAT DID MATTER WAS NOT WHETHER SHE THREW LAKE OVER BUT WHAT SHE THREW HIM OVER FOR
6848-76049-0010 IF IT WAS BECAUSE HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH WELL AND GOOD BUT IF IT WAS FOR SOME OTHER LOVER SOME GOOD LOOKING WORTHLESS IMPOSTOR SOME EUROPEAN TITLE OR SUCHLIKE FOLLY

302-123516-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
302-123516-0001 AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
302-123516-0002 RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
302-123516-0003 HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
302-123516-0004 AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
302-123516-0005 AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
302-123516-0006 I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
302-123516-0007 WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
302-123516-0008 WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
302-123516-0009 WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
302-123516-0010 WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
302-123516-0011 HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
302-123516-0012 I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
302-123516-0013 WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
302-123516-0014 RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
302-123516-0015 FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
302-123516-0016 I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
302-123516-0017 BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
302-123516-0018 BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
302-123516-0019 AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
302-123516-0020 VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
302-123516-0021 BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
302-123516-0022 BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
302-123516-0023 THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
302-123516-0024 THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
302-123516-0025 FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
302-123516-0026 AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
302-123516-0027 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0028 ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
302-123516-0029 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
302-123516-0030 SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
302-123516-0031 I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
302-123516-0032 HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
302-123516-0033 NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
302-123516-0034 BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
302-123516-0035 AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
302-123523-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0001 WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
302-123523-0002 AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0004 AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0006 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0007 AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
302-123523-0008 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0010 FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
302-123523-0011 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0013 I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
302-123523-0014 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0015 WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
302-123523-0016 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0017 AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
302-123523-0018 AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
302-123523-0019 WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
302-123523-0020 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0021 THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
302-123523-0022 WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
302-123523-0023 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0025 AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0027 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0028 SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
302-123523-0029 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0031 CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
302-123523-0032 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
302-123523-0034 FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
302-123523-0035 BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
302-123523-0036 BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
302-123523-0037 BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
302-123523-0038 WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
4853-27671-0000 THERE WERE A FEW STARS DYING OUT IN THE DARK WEST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE I KNEW HE WOULD TURN THE SABLE PALL OVERHEAD INTO BLUENESS THE HULL LAY VERY DEEP
4853-27671-0001 I HAD AT ONE TIME DURING THE BLACK HOURS STRUCK INTO A MOURNFUL CALCULATION AND RECKONED THAT THE BRIG WOULD FLOAT SOME TWO OR THREE HOURS AFTER SUNRISE
4853-27671-0002 AND A DEEP OF ROLLING SAPPHIRE I STARTED WITH SUDDEN TERROR TO OBSERVE HOW CLOSE THE COVERING BOARD SAT UPON THE WATER AND HOW THE HEAD OF EVERY SWELL RAN PAST AS HIGH AS THE BULWARK RAIL
4853-27671-0003 YET FOR A FEW MOMENTS I STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE SCENE OF RUIN IT WAS VISIBLE NOW TO ITS MOST TRIFLING DETAIL THE FOREMAST WAS GONE SMOOTH OFF AT THE DECK IT LAY OVER THE STARBOARD BOW
4853-27671-0004 ONE EXTRAORDINARY STROKE I QUICKLY DETECTED THE JOLLY BOAT HAD LAIN STOWED IN THE LONG BOAT IT WAS THUS WE CARRIED THOSE BOATS THE LITTLE ONE LYING SNUGLY ENOUGH IN THE OTHER THE SEA THAT HAD FLOODED OUR DECKS
4853-27671-0005 HAD FLOATED THE JOLLY BOAT OUT OF THE LONG BOAT AND SWEPT IT BOTTOM UP TO THE GANGWAY WHERE IT LAY AS THOUGH GOD'S MERCY DESIGNED IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR MY USE FOR NOT LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN FLOATED OUT THE BRIG STRUCK THE BERG THE MASTS FELL
4853-27671-0006 AND THERE LAY THE LONG BOAT CRUSHED INTO STAVES THIS SIGNAL AND SURPRISING INTERVENTION FILLED MY HEART WITH THANKFULNESS THOUGH MY SPIRITS SANK AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF MY POOR DROWNED SHIPMATES
4853-27671-0007 AND SO MADE A TACKLE BY THE HELP OF WHICH I TURNED THE JOLLY BOAT OVER I THEN WITH A HANDSPIKE PRISED HER NOSE TO THE GANGWAY SECURED A BUNCH OF ROPE ON EITHER SIDE HER TO ACT AS FENDERS OR BUFFERS
4853-27671-0008 WHEN SHE SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AND LYING ALONGSIDE RAN HER MIDWAY OUT BY THE TACKLE AND ATTACHING A LINE TO A RING BOLT IN HER BOW SHOVED HER OVER THE SIDE AND SHE FELL WITH A SPLASH SHIPPING SCARCE A HATFUL OF WATER
4853-27671-0009 BUT I MET WITH AN OAR THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THIS WITH THE MAST AND SAIL I DROPPED INTO HER THE SWELL LIFTING HER UP TO MY HAND WHEN THE BLUE FOLD SWUNG PAST MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO VICTUAL HER
4853-27671-0010 I RAN TO THE CABIN BUT THE LAZARETTE WAS FULL OF WATER AND NONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN IT TO BE COME AT I THEREUPON RANSACKED THE CABIN AND FOUND A WHOLE DUTCH CHEESE A PIECE OF RAW PORK HALF A HAM
4853-27671-0011 EIGHT OR TEN BISCUITS SOME CANDLES A TINDER BOX SEVERAL LEMONS A LITTLE BAG OF FLOWER AND THIRTEEN BOTTLES OF BEER THESE THINGS I ROLLED UP IN A CLOTH AND PLACED THEM IN THE BOAT
4853-27671-0012 THE HEAVY SLUGGISH SODDEN MOVEMENT OF THE HULL ADVISED ME TO MAKE HASTE SHE WAS NOW BARELY LIFTING TO THE SWELL THAT CAME BRIMMING IN BROAD LIQUID BLUE BROWS TO HER STEM
4853-27671-0013 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ANOTHER TON OF WATER WOULD SINK HER AND IF THE SWELL FELL OVER HER BOWS AND FILLED THE DECKS DOWN SHE WOULD GO I HAD A SMALL PARCEL OF GUINEAS IN MY CHEST AND WAS ABOUT TO FETCH THIS MONEY
4853-27671-0014 WHEN A SORT OF STAGGERING SENSATION IN THE UPWARD SLIDE OF THE HULL GAVE ME A FRIGHT AND WATCHING MY CHANCE I JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND CAST THE LINE THAT HELD HER ADRIFT THE SUN WAS AN HOUR ABOVE THE HORIZON
4853-27671-0015 HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
4853-27671-0016 TILL ALL THAT QUARTER OF THE SEA LOOKED TO BE A MASS OF LEAPING DAZZLE UPON THE EASTERN SEA LINE LAY A RANGE OF WHITE CLOUDS COMPACT AS THE CHALK CLIFFS OF DOVER
4853-27671-0017 SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
4853-27671-0018 WITH US HAD IT DAWNED YESTERDAY INSTEAD OF TO DAY MY COMPANIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND YONDER SINKING RUINED FABRIC A TRIM SHIP CAPABLE OF BEARING US STOUTLY INTO WARM SEAS AND TO OUR HOMES AT LAST
4853-27671-0019 I THREW THE OAR OVER THE STERN OF THE BOAT TO KEEP HER NEAR TO THE BRIG NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE I DESIRED TO SEE THE LAST OF HER
4853-27671-0020 INTO THOSE PRODIGIOUS LEAGUES OF OCEAN WHICH LAY STRETCHED UNDER THE SKY WHILST THE HULL FLOATED SHE WAS SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE EYE AMID THE VASTNESS OF WATER TO REST UPON
4853-27671-0021 AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
4853-27671-0022 AND WHICH SHE DRAGGED DOWN WITH HER ON A SUDDEN WHEN THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MAST HAD DISAPPEARED AND WHEN THE HOLLOWS OF THE WHIRLPOOLS WERE FLATTENING TO THE LEVEL SURFACE OF THE SEA UP ROSE A BODY WITH A SORT OF LEAP
4853-27671-0023 IT WAS THE SAILOR THAT HAD LAIN DROWNED ON THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FORWARD DECK BEING FROZEN STIFF HE ROSE IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH HE HAD EXPIRED THAT IS WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED
4853-27671-0024 SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
4853-27671-0025 AND SUCH WAS THE STATE OF MY MIND THAT IMAGINATION MIGHT QUICKLY HAVE WORKED THE APPARITION HAD IT LINGERED INTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE UNSETTLING OF MY REASON I ROSE FROM THE SEAT ON TO WHICH I HAD SUNK AND LOOSED THE SAIL
4853-27671-0026 AND HAULING THE SHEET AFT PUT THE OAR OVER THE STERN AND BROUGHT THE LITTLE CRAFT'S HEAD TO AN EASTERLY COURSE THE DRAUGHT OF AIR WAS EXTREMELY WEAK AND SCARCE FURNISHED IMPULSE ENOUGH TO THE SAIL TO RAISE A BUBBLE ALONGSIDE
4853-27671-0027 THE BOAT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET LONG
4853-27671-0028 ERE I COULD HEAVE A CIVILIZED COAST OR A HABITABLE ISLAND INTO VIEW AT THE START I HAD A MIND TO STEER NORTH WEST AND BLOW AS THE WIND WOULD SUFFER INTO THE SOUTH SEA
4853-27671-0029 WHERE PERCHANCE I MIGHT MEET A WHALER OR A SOUTHSEAMAN FROM NEW HOLLAND BUT MY HEART SANK AT THE PROSPECT OF THE LEAGUES OF WATER WHICH ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND THE ISLANDS AND THE WESTERN AMERICAN SEABOARD INDEED
4853-27671-0030 I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY ONLY HOPE OF DELIVERANCE LAY IN BEING PICKED UP AND THAT THOUGH BY HEADING EAST I SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE STORMY PARTS I WAS MORE LIKELY TO MEET WITH A SHIP HEREABOUTS
4853-27671-0031 THAN BY SAILING INTO THE GREAT DESOLATION OF THE NORTH WEST THE BURDEN OF MY LONELINESS WEIGHED DOWN UPON ME SO CRUSHINGLY THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER MY SENSES MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DULLED BY SUFFERING
4853-27671-0032 I AM PERSUADED MY HEART MUST HAVE BROKEN AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF FAINTLY AS THE WIND BLEW IT SPEEDILY WAFTED ME OUT OF SIGHT OF THE FLOATING RELICS OF THE WRECK
4853-27671-0033 AND THEN ALL WAS BARE BALD SWELLING SEA AND EMPEARLED SKY DARKENING IN LAGOONS OF AZURE DOWN TO THE SOFT MOUNTAINOUS MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR LYING LIKE THE COAST OF A CONTINENT ON THE LARBOARD HORIZON
4853-27671-0034 BUT ONE LIVING THING THERE WAS BESIDES MYSELF A GREY BREASTED ALBATROSS OF A PRINCELY WIDTH OF PINION I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT TILL THE HULL WENT DOWN AND THEN
4853-27671-0035 LIFTING MY EYES WITH INVOLUNTARY SYMPATHY IN THE DIRECTION POINTED TO BY THE UPRAISED ARMS OF THE SAILOR I OBSERVED THE GREAT ROYAL BIRD HANGING LIKE A SHAPE OF MARBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE FROTHING EDDIES
4853-27671-0036 IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE DEEP HAD TAKEN FORM IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOBLEST OF ALL THE FOWLS OF ITS DOMINIONS AND POISED ON TREMORLESS WINGS
4853-27671-0037 WAS SURVEYING WITH THE COLD CURIOSITY OF AN INTELLIGENCE EMPTY OF HUMAN EMOTION THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THOSE FABRICS WHOSE UNEQUAL CONTESTS AND REPEATED TRIUMPHS HAD PROVOKED ITS HAUGHTY SURPRISE
4853-27671-0038 THE BIRD QUITTED THE SPOT OF THE WRECK AFTER A WHILE AND FOLLOWED ME ITS EYES HAD THE SPARKLING BLOOD RED GLEAM OF RUBIES
4853-27671-0039 IT WAS AS SILENT AS A PHANTOM AND WITH ARCHED NECK AND MOTIONLESS PLUMES SEEMED TO WATCH ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT PRESENTLY GREW INSUFFERABLE SO FAR FROM FINDING ANY COMFORT OF COMPANIONSHIP IN THE CREATURE
4853-27671-0040 IT UTTERED A STRANGE SALT CRY THE VERY NOTE OF A GUST OF WIND SPLITTING UPON A ROPE FLAPPED ITS WINGS AND AFTER A TURN OR TWO
4853-29413-0000 GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A NIGHT OF FEVER A NIGHT WHEN I DID SLUMBER FOR A FEW MINUTES OF HORRID DREAMS THIS WAS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
4853-29413-0001 THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
4853-29413-0002 THE SERVANT ANNOUNCED THAT A MAN WAS WAITING TO SEE ME THE SAME MAN SIR WHO WAS FOUND IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AT YOUR FLOWERS I AT ONCE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE HIM SHOWN UP INTO MY BEDROOM
4853-29413-0003 THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
4853-29413-0004 WITH A FACE OMINOUSLY WRETCHED AS WELL AS UGLY I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF CRISTEL IF YOU BRING ME BAD NEWS I SAID DON'T KEEP ME WAITING FOR IT IT'S NOTHING THAT NEED TROUBLE YOU SIR
4853-29413-0005 I'M DISMISSED FROM MY MASTER'S SERVICE THAT'S ALL IT WAS PLAINLY NOT ALL RELIEVED EVEN BY THAT GUARDED REPLY I POINTED TO A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WELL BY YOU I ASKED
4853-29413-0006 WHAT DID HE DO FLEW INTO A FURIOUS RAGE I DON'T COMPLAIN OF THAT I DARESAY I DESERVED IT PLEASE TO EXCUSE MY GETTING UP AGAIN I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE FACE AND TELL YOU OF IT HE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
4853-29413-0007 EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
4853-29413-0008 IN THIS DIFFICULTY HE CAME BACK TO MY BEDSIDE LOOK HERE SIR WHAT I SAY IS THAT KICK HAS WIPED OUT THE DEBT OF THANKS I OWE HIM YES I SAY THE ACCOUNT BETWEEN US TWO IS SETTLED NOW ON BOTH SIDES
4853-29413-0009 WHAT HIS MASTER HAD NO DOUBT INFERRED WAS WHAT I SAW PLAINLY TOO CRISTEL HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND HAD BEEN DIRECTED HOW TO DO IT BY THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD SUFFERED IN MY CAUSE
4853-29413-0010 WE WILL WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE WE TALK OF SETTING THE LAW IN FORCE I SAID IN THE MEANTIME GLOODY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD TELL THE MAGISTRATE IF I CALLED YOU AS A WITNESS HE CONSIDERED A LITTLE
4853-29413-0011 THE MAGISTRATE WOULD PUT QUESTIONS TO ME WOULDN'T HE SIR VERY GOOD YOU PUT QUESTIONS TO ME AND I'LL ANSWER THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
4853-29413-0012 THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
4853-29413-0013 THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
4853-29413-0014 TO GIVE HIM SOME IDEA OF THE JEALOUS HATRED WITH WHICH THE CUR REGARDED ME HE HAD DONE HIS BEST TO WARN ME WITHOUT ACTUALLY BETRAYING THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED HIM FROM STARVATION OR THE WORKHOUSE AND HE HAD FAILED
4853-29413-0015 BUT HIS RESOLUTION TO DO ME GOOD SERVICE IN RETURN FOR MY KINDNESS TO HIM FAR FROM BEING SHAKEN WAS CONFIRMED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE CHEMICAL STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
4853-29413-0016 GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
4853-29413-0017 A LAPSE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FOLLOWED THE LAST DOSE WAS REPEATED AND THE DOG SOON SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AS LIVELY AS EVER GLOODY WAS THEREUPON TOLD TO SET THE ANIMAL FREE AND WAS INFORMED AT THE SAME TIME
4853-29413-0018 THAT HE WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED IF HE MENTIONED TO ANY LIVING CREATURE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN BY WHAT PROCESS HE ARRIVED AT THE SUSPICION THAT MY SAFETY MIGHT BE THREATENED BY THE EXPERIMENT ON THE DOG HE WAS ENTIRELY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
4853-29413-0019 IT WAS BORNE IN ON MY MIND SIR AND THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU HE SAID I DIDN'T DARE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED ME OR IF YOU DID BELIEVE ME YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR THE POLICE
4853-29413-0020 THE ONE WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO MURDERING MISCHIEF IF MURDERING MISCHIEF IT MIGHT BE WAS TO TRUST MISS CRISTEL THAT SHE WAS FOND OF YOU I DON'T MEAN ANY OFFENCE SIR I PRETTY WELL GUESSED
4853-29413-0021 THAT SHE WAS TRUE AS STEEL AND NOT EASILY FRIGHTENED I DIDN'T NEED TO GUESS I KNEW IT GLOODY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO PREPARE CRISTEL FOR THE TERRIBLE CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD DETERMINED TO REPOSE IN HER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
4853-29413-0022 SHE WAS PLEDGED TO SECRECY UNDER PENALTY OF RUINING THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME AND TO HER PRESENCE OF MIND WAS TRUSTED THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE WHAT A SITUATION FOR A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
4853-29413-0023 WHATEVER SHE SAW HIM DRINK SHE WAS TO INSIST ON YOUR DRINKING IT TOO YOU HEARD ME ASK LEAVE TO MAKE THE TEA YES WELL THAT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALS AGREED ON BETWEEN US
4853-29413-0024 HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
4853-29413-0025 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THIS AFTER WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME MY INTELLIGENCE BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AS I WENT ON AND YOUR ACCIDENT IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS PLANNED OF COURSE I SAID
4853-29413-0026 I SHOULD SAY NO JUDGING BY HIS LOOKS HE TURNED PALE WHEN HE FELT THE FLOOR SHAKEN BY YOUR FALL FOR ONCE IN A WAY HE WAS HONEST HONESTLY FRIGHTENED I NOTICED THE SAME THING SIR WHEN HE PICKED ME UP OFF THE FLOOR
4853-29413-0027 A MAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS COMPLEXION AT WILL IS A MAN WE HAV'N'T HEARD OF YET MISTER ROYLAKE I HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR SOME TIME PAST LONGING TO SEE CRISTEL IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY
4853-29413-0028 IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
4853-29413-0029 WHILE THE DEAF MAN LODGES AT THE COTTAGE HE MEANS MISCHIEF AND HIS EYE IS ON MISS CRISTEL EARLY THIS MORNING SIR I HAPPENED TO BE AT THE BOAT HOUSE SOMEBODY I LEAVE YOU TO GUESS WHO IT IS HAS STOLEN THE OARS
4853-29413-0030 I WAS DRESSED BY THIS TIME AND SO EAGER TO GET TO THE COTTAGE THAT I HAD ALREADY OPENED MY DOOR WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE ROOM AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE BOTH SUSPECTED THE SAME PERSON OF STEALING THE OARS
4853-29413-0031 HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
4853-29413-0032 AND NOTHING MORE THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AND OUGHT TO TELL ME NOTHING SIR
6818-76332-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE STRANGER AT THE DOOR MISSUS COLLINGWOOD REMAINED A LONG TIME UP STAIRS
6818-76332-0001 SO LONG INDEED THAT THE GIRLS BEGAN TO BE RATHER UNEASY FEARING THAT SHE HAD FAINTED OR PERHAPS WAS ILL OR OVERCOME
6818-76332-0002 DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO GO UP ASKED CYNTHIA ANXIOUSLY PERHAPS SHE NEEDS HELP NO I THINK SHE JUST WANTS TO BE BY HERSELF IT WAS FINE OF YOU CYNTHIA TO SEND HER UP ALONE
6818-76332-0003 I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'D HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AT LENGTH THEY HEARD HER COMING SLOWLY DOWN AND PRESENTLY SHE REENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM THEY COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS MUCH MOVED AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CRYING
6818-76332-0004 SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM AT ONCE BUT WENT AND STOOD BY THE MANTEL LOOKING UP LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE TWINS MY BABIES THEY HEARD HER MURMUR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALOUD
6818-76332-0005 AT LAST HOWEVER SHE CAME TO THEM AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BETWEEN THEM ON THE SOFA THEY WONDERED NERVOUSLY WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY MY LITTLE GIRLS SHE BEGAN FORGIVE ME
6818-76332-0006 I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER YOURSELVES ALMOST YOUNG LADIES BUT YOU SEE I AM AN OLD WOMAN I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MY LIFE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ALREADY KNOW MOST OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS
6818-76332-0007 SHE PATTED JOYCE'S HAND THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW AND AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME YOU DESERVE TO I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL
6818-76332-0008 ONLY SEVENTEEN I WAS A SOUTHERNER BUT MY HUSBAND CAME FROM THE NORTH AND BROUGHT ME UP NORTH HERE TO LIVE I ALWAYS HATED IT THIS NORTHERN LIFE AND THOUGH I
6818-76332-0009 LOVED MY HUSBAND DEARLY I HATED HIS DEVOTION TO IT WE NEVER AGREED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN MY TWIN BABIES WERE BORN I SECRETLY DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOUTHERNERS
6818-76332-0010 IN SPIRIT AND ONLY SOUTHERNERS I PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH THEY SHOULD MARRY IN THE SOUTH AND LIVE THERE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THEM
6818-76332-0011 BUT IN THIS LIFE THINGS SELDOM TURN OUT AS WE PLAN MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BEFORE SHE WAS THREE AND I HAD SCARCELY BECOME RECONCILED TO THIS GRIEF
6818-76332-0012 WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM ME SO I CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON MY SON ON FAIRFAX AS HE GREW OLDER HOWEVER AND AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME NEARER
6818-76332-0013 I NOTICED THAT HE TALKED MORE AND MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE NORTH AND THIS DISTRESSED ME TERRIBLY HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT TO HIM FOR HE WAS A HEADSTRONG BOY
6818-76332-0014 AND HAD ALWAYS RESENTED OPPOSITION AND I FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAS OLDER I WISHED TO SEND HIM TO A SOUTHERN COLLEGE BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM TO HARVARD
6818-76332-0015 AS HIS HEART WAS SO SET ON IT I COULDN'T DENY HIM THINKING THAT EVEN THIS WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE END THEN CAME THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS
6818-76332-0016 AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES BUT
6818-76332-0017 I LITTLE KNEW HIM I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED
6818-76332-0018 WE HAD OUR INTERVIEW I HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED THE MOST VIOLENT TEMPER A MORTAL HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH AND IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS WHEN I GOT INTO A RAGE IT BLINDED ME TO EVERYTHING ELSE
6818-76332-0019 TO EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONSIDERATION AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW WELL NEED I SAY IT FAIRFAX WAS SIMPLY IMMOVABLE GENTLE AND LOVING ALWAYS
6818-76332-0020 BUT I COULD NO MORE IMPRESS HIM WITH MY WISHES THAN I COULD HAVE MOVED THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR THE GALLING PART TO ME WAS THAT HE KEPT INSISTING HE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT RIGHT
6818-76332-0021 HOW COULD HE BE RIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL DIRECTLY CONTRARY BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW I HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENTLY WITH THE PASSING SORROWFUL YEARS BUT TO GO BACK
6818-76332-0022 I STOOD IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND THEN I TURNED FROM HIM DISOWNED HIM BADE HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN AND INFORMED HIM THAT I MYSELF WOULD ABANDON THE PLACE ON THE MORROW
6818-76332-0023 AND RETURN TO THE SOUTH HE LEFT ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WENT TO HIS ROOM I IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED THE SERVANTS AND DISMISSED THEM ON THE SPOT GIVING THEM ONLY TIME TO GET THEIR THINGS TOGETHER AND GO
6818-76332-0024 THEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN MY ROOM TILL HE WAS GONE HE CAME SEVERAL TIMES KNOCKED AT MY DOOR AND BEGGED ME TO SEE HIM BUT I WOULD NOT
6818-76332-0025 HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT ON
6818-76332-0026 I NEVER SAW OR KNEW OF IT TILL THIS DAY IF I HAD JUST AT THIS POINT THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD KNOCK COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0027 SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR
6818-76332-0028 I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MISSUS COLLINGWOOD I THINK I DID
6818-76332-0029 I WAS TOO HURRIED AND NERVOUS WHEN I CAME IN TO THINK OF IT THAT'S IT THEN SOME ONE HAS SEEN IT OPEN AND HAS STOPPED TO INQUIRE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT SHE HURRIED AWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0030 AND AFTER AN EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PULLING IT OPEN A MAN A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER STOOD OUTSIDE THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SURPRISE PARDON ME HE SAID
6818-76332-0031 BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY THAT IS NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST JUST TO DAY
6818-76332-0032 OH ER I SEE THE FACT IS THE STRANGER WENT ON I WAS PASSING HERE AND NOTICED THIS OUTER DOOR OPEN WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE QUEER I USED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE VERY WELL INDEED
6818-76332-0033 AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST
6818-76332-0034 THOUGH RATHER VERGING ON THE ELDERLY HIS IRON GRAY HAIR WAS CRISPLY CURLY AND HIS DARK EYES TWINKLED OUT FROM UNDER BUSHY GRAY BROWS HIS SMILE WAS CAPTIVATING
6818-76332-0035 JOYCE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT SHE LIKED HIM OH DID YOU KNOW THE FAMILY THE THE COLLINGWOODS HE SUPPLEMENTED WITH HIS TWINKLING SMILE YES I KNEW THEM QUITE INTIMATELY
6818-76332-0036 MIGHT I PERHAPS IF IT WOULD NOT BE INTRUDING COME IN JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD PLACE THAT IS HE ADDED HASTILY SEEING HER HESITATE ONLY IF IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONVENIENT
6818-76332-0037 I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE TIED WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER
6818-76332-0038 YET HOW WAS SHE TO COMPLY WITH IT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD AND THE ALMOST UNEXPLAINABLE POSITION OF HERSELF AND CYNTHIA WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF IT ALL WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING AN IDEA CAME TO HER
6818-76332-0039 THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO DAY ON ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE
6818-76332-0040 MY NAME IS CALTHORPE BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND I DO NOT WISH TO TROUBLE THEM BUT JOYCE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF AND TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS SHE HEARD THE NAME LEAVING HIM STANDING THERE
6818-76332-0041 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD HOWEVER SHOOK HER HEAD WHEN JOYCE ANNOUNCED WHO WAS OUTSIDE I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY ONE NAMED CALTHORPE AND I SCARCELY FEEL THAT I CAN SEE A STRANGER NOW
6818-76332-0042 BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN
6818-76332-0043 SHE TOOK CYNTHIA'S ARM WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND PARTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WHILE JOYCE WENT OUT TO ADMIT THE STRANGER IF YOU CARE TO LOOK AROUND THE DRAWING ROOM YOU WILL BE MOST WELCOME SHE ANNOUNCED POLITELY
6818-76332-0044 HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION GRATEFULLY AND ENTERED WITH HER AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOWEVER HE STARTED BACK SLIGHTLY AS WITH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE WHY HOW STRANGE HOW VERY SINGULAR HE MURMURED
6818-76332-0045 THESE CANDLES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY DID YOU OFTEN COME HERE INQUIRED JOYCE YOU MUST BE VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE
6818-76332-0046 YES I CAME OFTEN I WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INMATE HE BEGAN TO WANDER SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES IN FRONT OF THE BABY TWINS HE PAUSED A LONG TIME
6818-76332-0047 THEN YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN YOUNG MISTER FAIRFAX VERY WELL SUGGESTED JOYCE THAT'S HE ON THE RIGHT IN THE PICTURE THE STRANGER EYED HER CURIOUSLY WHY YES I KNEW HIM WELL
6818-76332-0048 BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY TELL ME ARE YOU A A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
6818-76332-0049 BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM AN UNHAPPY FAMILY WAS HIS ONLY COMMENT AND HE CONTINUED HIS TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
6818-76332-0050 IN FRONT OF THE OLD SQUARE OPEN PIANO HE PAUSED AGAIN AND FINGERED THE SILK SCARF THAT HAD AT SOME LONG AGO DATE BEEN THROWN CARELESSLY UPON IT THEN HE RAN HIS FINGERS LIGHTLY OVER THE YELLOW KEYS
6818-76332-0051 THE TONES WERE UNBELIEVABLY JANGLING AND DISCORDANT YET JOYCE THOUGHT SHE CAUGHT THE NOTES OF A LITTLE TUNE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE BROKE INTO THE AIR SINGING SOFTLY THE OPENING LINE
6818-76332-0052 HE HAD SUNG NO MORE WHEN THE FACE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY HER EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HER FEATURES ALMOST GRAY IN COLOR
6818-76332-0053 WHO WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN A VOICE SCARCELY LOUDER THAN A WHISPER THE STRANGER GAZED AT HER WITH A FIXED LOOK ARTHUR
6818-76332-0054 ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED NO YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM NO ONE
6818-76332-0055 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE
6818-76332-0056 THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS
200-124140-0000 AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
200-124140-0001 THE NOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ITS CONTENTS AS QUICKLY COMPLIED WITH MISSUS BENNET ACCOMPANIED BY HER TWO YOUNGEST GIRLS REACHED NETHERFIELD SOON AFTER THE FAMILY BREAKFAST HAD SHE FOUND JANE IN ANY APPARENT DANGER
200-124140-0002 SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN THEREFORE TO HER DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL OF BEING CARRIED HOME NEITHER DID THE APOTHECARY WHO ARRIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIME THINK IT AT ALL ADVISABLE AFTER SITTING A LITTLE WHILE WITH JANE
200-124140-0003 ON MISS BINGLEY'S APPEARANCE AND INVITATION THE MOTHER AND THREE DAUGHTERS ALL ATTENDED HER INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR BINGLEY MET THEM WITH HOPES THAT MISSUS BENNET HAD NOT FOUND MISS BENNET WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED
200-124140-0004 INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
200-124140-0005 REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY

200-124140-0007 AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
200-124140-0008 OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
200-124140-0009 IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT A DEEP INTRICATE CHARACTER IS MORE OR LESS ESTIMABLE THAN SUCH A ONE AS YOURS LIZZY CRIED HER MOTHER REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AND DO NOT RUN ON IN THE WILD MANNER THAT YOU ARE SUFFERED TO DO AT HOME
200-124140-0010 I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
200-124140-0011 THEY HAVE AT LEAST THAT ADVANTAGE THE COUNTRY SAID DARCY CAN IN GENERAL SUPPLY BUT A FEW SUBJECTS FOR SUCH A STUDY IN A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU MOVE IN A VERY CONFINED AND UNVARYING SOCIETY
200-124140-0012 BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES ALTER SO MUCH
200-124140-0013 OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
200-124140-0014 TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
200-124140-0015 THEY HAVE EACH THEIR ADVANTAGES AND I CAN BE EQUALLY HAPPY IN EITHER AYE THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DISPOSITION BUT THAT GENTLEMAN LOOKING AT DARCY SEEMED TO THINK THE COUNTRY WAS NOTHING AT ALL
200-124140-0016 INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
200-124140-0017 WHICH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE TRUE CERTAINLY MY DEAR NOBODY SAID THERE WERE BUT AS TO NOT MEETING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBOURHOODS LARGER I KNOW WE DINE WITH FOUR AND TWENTY FAMILIES
200-124140-0018 NOTHING BUT CONCERN FOR ELIZABETH COULD ENABLE BINGLEY TO KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE HIS SISTER WAS LESS DELICATE AND DIRECTED HER EYES TOWARDS MISTER DARCY WITH A VERY EXPRESSIVE SMILE
200-124140-0019 ELIZABETH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT TURN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS NOW ASKED HER IF CHARLOTTE LUCAS HAD BEEN AT LONGBOURN SINCE HER COMING AWAY
200-124140-0020 SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
200-124140-0021 AND NEVER OPEN THEIR MOUTHS QUITE MISTAKE THE MATTER DID CHARLOTTE DINE WITH YOU NO SHE WOULD GO HOME I FANCY SHE WAS WANTED ABOUT THE MINCE PIES
200-124140-0022 FOR MY PART MISTER BINGLEY I ALWAYS KEEP SERVANTS THAT CAN DO THEIR OWN WORK MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT UP VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY IS TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE LUCASES ARE A VERY GOOD SORT OF GIRLS I ASSURE YOU IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT HANDSOME
200-124140-0023 NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
200-124140-0024 I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
200-124140-0025 BUT HOWEVER HE DID NOT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG HOWEVER HE WROTE SOME VERSES ON HER AND VERY PRETTY THEY WERE AND SO ENDED HIS AFFECTION SAID ELIZABETH IMPATIENTLY
200-124140-0026 THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
200-124140-0027 OF A FINE STOUT HEALTHY LOVE IT MAY EVERYTHING NOURISHES WHAT IS STRONG ALREADY BUT IF IT BE ONLY A SLIGHT THIN SORT OF INCLINATION I AM CONVINCED THAT ONE GOOD SONNET WILL STARVE IT ENTIRELY AWAY
200-124140-0028 DARCY ONLY SMILED AND THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH ENSUED MADE ELIZABETH TREMBLE LEST HER MOTHER SHOULD BE EXPOSING HERSELF AGAIN SHE LONGED TO SPEAK BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY
200-124140-0029 AND FORCED HIS YOUNGER SISTER TO BE CIVIL ALSO AND SAY WHAT THE OCCASION REQUIRED SHE PERFORMED HER PART INDEED WITHOUT MUCH GRACIOUSNESS BUT MISSUS BENNET WAS SATISFIED AND SOON AFTERWARDS ORDERED HER CARRIAGE UPON THIS SIGNAL
200-124140-0030 THE YOUNGEST OF HER DAUGHTERS PUT HERSELF FORWARD THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER DURING THE WHOLE VISIT AND THE RESULT OF IT WAS THAT THE YOUNGEST SHOULD TAX MISTER BINGLEY WITH HAVING PROMISED ON HIS FIRST COMING INTO THE COUNTRY TO GIVE A BALL AT NETHERFIELD
200-124140-0031 LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS
200-124140-0032 AND A SORT OF NATURAL SELF CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE OFFICERS TO WHOM HER UNCLE'S GOOD DINNERS AND HER OWN EASY MANNERS RECOMMENDED HER HAD INCREASED INTO ASSURANCE
200-124140-0033 AND ABRUPTLY REMINDED HIM OF HIS PROMISE
200-124140-0034 HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
200-124140-0035 BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
200-124140-0036 AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
200-124140-0037 MISSUS BENNET AND HER DAUGHTERS THEN DEPARTED AND ELIZABETH RETURNED INSTANTLY TO JANE LEAVING HER OWN AND HER RELATIONS BEHAVIOUR TO THE REMARKS OF THE TWO LADIES AND MISTER DARCY THE LATTER OF WHOM HOWEVER
200-124140-0038 COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON TO JOIN IN THEIR CENSURE OF HER IN SPITE OF ALL MISS BINGLEY'S WITTICISMS ON
200-126784-0000 CHAPTER FIVE THROUGH SOLWAY SANDS THROUGH TAROSS MOSS BLINDFOLD HE KNEW THE PATHS TO CROSS BY WILY TURNS BY DESPERATE BOUNDS HAD BAFFLED PERCY'S BEST BLOODHOUNDS
200-126784-0001 IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
200-126784-0002 WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
200-126784-0003 AND THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BEDS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNREFRESHED AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING CLOSED THEIR EYES ON TAKING AN EAGER AND HASTY SURVEY OF THE VALLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THEIR ROOM NOTHING HOWEVER BUT ITS USUAL SERENITY WAS TO BE SEEN
200-126784-0004 COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
200-126784-0005 THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
200-126784-0006 HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
200-126784-0007 THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
200-126784-0008 TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
200-126784-0009 LOOKING AT HIM AFFECTIONATELY MUCH AS I LOVE MY OWN COUNTRY THE APPROACH OF HER TROOPS JUST NOW WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PAIN THE BROTHER MADE NO REPLY BUT RETURNING THE FONDNESS EXPRESSED IN HER EYE BY A LOOK OF FRATERNAL TENDERNESS
200-126784-0010 HE GENTLY PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE WHEN CAESAR WHO HAD PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE ANXIETY OF THE FAMILY AND WHO HAD RISEN WITH THE DAWN AND KEPT A VIGILANT WATCH ON THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AS HE STOOD GAZING FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
200-126784-0011 RUN MASSA HARRY RUN
200-126784-0012 RUN REPEATED THE BRITISH OFFICER GATHERING HIMSELF UP IN MILITARY PRIDE NO MISTER CAESAR RUNNING IS NOT MY TRADE WHILE SPEAKING HE WALKED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
200-126784-0013 WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
200-126784-0014 HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
200-126784-0015 VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MATTERS OF NO TRIFLING CONCERN WERE ON THE CARPET A SHORT COMMUNICATION WITH THE LOQUACIOUS HOUSEKEEPER FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIN BODY OF THE TROOP AND THE ADVANCE PARTY REMOUNTING
200-126784-0016 BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
200-126784-0017 AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
200-126784-0018 THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
200-126784-0019 NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
200-126784-0020 WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
200-126784-0021 AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
200-126784-0022 HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INDICATE AS BELONGING TO HIS NATURE HIS DARK HAIR HUNG AROUND HIS BROW IN PROFUSION THOUGH STAINED WITH POWDER WHICH WAS WORN AT THAT DAY AND HIS FACE WAS NEARLY HID IN THE WHISKERS BY WHICH IT WAS DISFIGURED
200-126784-0023 STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
200-126784-0024 AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
200-126784-0025 MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
200-126784-0026 RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE REPLY HAS THERE BEEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH YOU DURING THE STORM CONTINUED THE DRAGOON SPEAKING WITH INTEREST AND IN SOME DEGREE SHARING IN THE EVIDENT ANXIETY OF THE FATHER
200-126784-0027 AND HAS NOT YET DEPARTED THIS GENTLEMAN REPEATED THE OTHER TURNING TO CAPTAIN WHARTON AND CONTEMPLATING HIS FIGURE FOR A MOMENT
200-126784-0028 HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
200-126784-0029 I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
200-126784-0030 MISTER WHARTON GROANED ALOUD BUT THE LADIES IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR VISITOR'S KNOWLEDGE REMAINED IN TREMBLING YET RIGID SILENCE THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF MOVED HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS HEAD
200-126784-0031 AND DISCOVERED THAT THE TREPIDATION OF HIS SISTERS HAD LEFT SOME OF HIS NATURAL HAIR EXPOSED THE DRAGOON WATCHED THE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTINUED SMILE WHEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF TURNING TO THE FATHER HE PROCEEDED
200-126784-0032 MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
200-126784-0033 TO ME HE WAS A TOTAL STRANGER YOU HAVE BUT LITTLE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS CHARACTER ANSWERED THE DRAGOON DRYLY BUT HE IS GONE HOW WHEN AND WHITHER
200-126784-0034 HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
200-126784-0035 HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
200-126784-0036 GAINING THE LAWN IN EARNEST AND APPARENTLY PLEASED CONVERSATION WITH HIS TWO SUBALTERNS IN A FEW MOMENTS ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE TROOPS AND HORSEMEN LEFT THE VALLEY AT FULL SPEED BY ITS VARIOUS ROADS
200-126784-0037 THE SUSPENSE OF THE PARTY WITHIN WHO WERE ALL HIGHLY INTERESTED WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE
332-128985-0000 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0002 HE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0004 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
332-128985-0005 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
332-128985-0006 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
332-128985-0007 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
332-128985-0008 THAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
332-128985-0010 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
332-128985-0011 THIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOG
332-128985-0012 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
332-128985-0013 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
332-128985-0014 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
332-128985-0016 ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
332-128985-0017 WITH HIS CUTLASS WAVING HIGH IN THE AIR HE WOULD RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET AND TAKE A WHACK AT EVERY ONE WHOM HE MET AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE CITIZENS ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE STREET TO HIMSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY
332-128985-0018 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
332-128985-0019 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
332-128985-0020 IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
332-128985-0021 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
332-128985-0022 BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
332-128985-0023 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
332-128985-0026 DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0029 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
332-128985-0030 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0032 ROC MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS OR PERHAPS HE RELIED SOMEWHAT UPON THE FEAR WHICH HIS VERY PRESENCE EVOKED BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE THIS TIME HE HAD RUN INTO THE LION'S JAW AND THE LION HAD CLOSED HIS TEETH UPON HIM
332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
332-128985-0034 AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
332-128985-0035 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
332-128985-0036 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0038 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
332-128985-0041 HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0044 BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
332-128985-0045 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
332-128985-0046 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
332-128985-0047 THE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN
332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
332-128985-0050 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
332-128985-0051 HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
332-128985-0053 IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
332-128985-0054 AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
332-128985-0055 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
332-128985-0056 WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
332-128985-0057 UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
332-128985-0058 THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
332-128985-0059 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0061 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
332-128985-0062 WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO GAMBLE TO GET DRUNK AND TO RUN AMUCK UP AND DOWN THE DECK BUT HE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL THESE RECREATIONS AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE SUCH AN ABLE BODIED AND WILLING SAILOR
332-128985-0063 THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
332-128985-0064 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
332-128985-0065 THESE FISH HE SOLD TO THE OFFICERS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THIS WAY HE EARNED NO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PERHAPS THAT MANY DOLLARS IF THIS ACCOUNT IS TRUE FISH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY IN THOSE DAYS
332-128985-0066 IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
332-128985-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
332-128985-0069 NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0071 OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
332-128985-0073 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
332-128985-0074 IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
332-128985-0075 AFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDED
332-128985-0076 STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
332-128985-0079 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
332-128985-0080 WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0081 BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0083 WHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMED
332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
332-128985-0085 THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
332-128985-0086 UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
332-128985-0087 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
4195-186237-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR HOME AGAIN THE MAJOR WAS AT THE STATION TO MEET THEM
4195-186237-0001 THE GIRL CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM OUTSIDE THE GATES HIS FACE RED AND BEAMING AS A POPPY IN BLOOM AND HIS SNOWY MOUSTACHE BRISTLING WITH EAGERNESS AT ONCE SHE DROPPED HER BUNDLES AND FLEW TO THE MAJOR'S ARMS
4195-186237-0002 LEAVING THE LITTLE MAN IN HER WAKE TO RESCUE HER BELONGINGS AND FOLLOW AFTER HE COULD HARDLY SEE PATSY AT ALL THE MAJOR WRAPPED HER IN SUCH AN AMPLE EMBRACE BUT BYE AND BYE SHE ESCAPED TO GET HER BREATH AND THEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE MEEK FORM HOLDING HER BUNDLES

4195-186237-0013 DANNY REEVES HIMSELF CAME INSTEAD AND MADE A NICE LITTLE SPEECH SAYING THAT PATSY HAD ALWAYS BROUGHT GOOD LUCK TO THE PLACE AND THIS DINNER WAS HIS TREAT TO WELCOME HER HOME SO THE MAJOR THANKED HIM WITH GRACIOUS DIGNITY AND PATSY KISSED DANNY ON HIS RIGHT CHEEK

4195-186237-0015 THE PLACE WAS SO PLAIN AFTER THE COMPARATIVE LUXURY OF ELMHURST AND ESPECIALLY OF THE ROSE CHAMBER PATSY HAD OCCUPIED THAT THE OLD MAN COULD NOT FAIL TO MARVEL AT THE GIRL'S ECSTATIC JOY TO FIND HERSELF IN THE OLD TENEMENT AGAIN
4195-186237-0016 THERE WAS ONE GOOD SIZED LIVING ROOM WITH AN ANCIENT RAG CARPET PARTIALLY COVERING THE FLOOR A SHEET IRON STOVE A SOFA A TABLE AND THREE OR FOUR OLD FASHIONED CHAIRS THAT HAD PROBABLY COME FROM A SECOND HAND DEALER
4195-186237-0017 OPENING FROM THIS WERE TWO CLOSET LIKE ROOMS CONTAINING EACH A BED AND A CHAIR WITH A WASH BASIN ON A BRACKET SHELF ON THE WAILS WERE A FEW COLORED PRINTS FROM THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPERS AND ONE LARGE AND FINE PHOTOGRAPH OF A GRIZZLED OLD SOLDIER

4195-186238-0013 BUT HE DIDN'T GO AWAY QUIETLY YOU MAY BE SURE MISTER MARVIN AND MISTER ISHAM BOTH ESCORTED THEIR FAMOUS CLIENT TO THE DOOR

4195-186236-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE PATSY ADOPTS AN UNCLE UNCLE JOHN AND MISTER WATSON DID NOT APPEAR AT DINNER BEING CLOSETED IN THE FORMER'S ROOM
4195-186236-0001 BEING SERVED BY THE OLD SERVANTS AS A MERE MATTER OF ROUTINE INDEED THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY CHANGED BY THE DEATH OF ITS MISTRESS AND WITHOUT ANY REAL HEAD TO DIRECT THEM THE SERVANTS WERE PATIENTLY AWAITING THE ADVENT OF A NEW MASTER OR MISTRESS
4195-186236-0002 BUT THERE WERE FEW TEARS SHED FOR JANE MERRICK AND THE NEW REGIME COULD NOT FAIL TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST
4195-186236-0003 BUT BEING UNAWARE OF ITS IMPORT GAVE IT BUT PASSING ATTENTION THE MAIN SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION WAS AUNT JANE'S SURPRISING ACT IN ANNULLING HER LAST WILL AND FORCING PATRICIA TO ACCEPT THE INHERITANCE WHEN SHE DID NOT WANT IT
4195-186236-0004 WHEN ALONE WITH THE THREE COUSINS PROTESTED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR PATSY TO GIVE HIM ALL THE ESTATE BUT AS SHE WAS SO GENEROUS HE WOULD ACCEPT ENOUGH OF HIS UNCLE TOM'S MONEY TO EDUCATE HIM AS AN ARTIST AND PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF AN HUMBLE HOME
4195-186236-0005 LOUISE AND BETH HAVING AT LAST FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR COUSIN'S DESIRE TO INCREASE THEIR BEQUESTS WERE OPENLY VERY GRATEFUL FOR HER GOOD WILL ALTHOUGH SECRETLY THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO RESENT PATSY'S CHOICE OF THE BOY AS THE PROPER HEIR OF HIS UNCLE'S FORTUNE
4195-186236-0006 THE BALANCE OF POWER SEEMED TO BE IN PATRICIA'S HANDS HOWEVER
4195-186236-0007 TO OFFEND HER ALTOGETHER THEY WERE ALL BETTER PROVIDED FOR THAN THEY HAD FEARED WOULD BE THE CASE SO THE LITTLE PARTY SPENT A PLEASANT EVENING AND SEPARATED EARLY BETH AND LOUISE TO GO TO THEIR ROOMS AND CANVASS QUIETLY THE EVENTS OF THE DAY

4195-186236-0010 AND THE SUBSEQUENT FINDING OF THE WILL

7148-82991-0023 FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND HIS COMPANIONS DREW THEIR SWORDS AND WOULD HAVE INSTANTLY FALLEN UPON THE STURDY OFFENDER IF MORGAN FENWOLF WHO WITH THE EARL OF SURREY WAS STANDING AMONG THE SPECTATORS HAD NOT RUSHED FORWARD AND CLOSING

7148-82991-0028 HAD ISSUED FROM THE HOSTEL AND JOINED THE EARL AND THEY WALKED TOGETHER AFTER THE CROWD IN A FEW MINUTES THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH REACHED HENRY THE EIGHTH'S GATE WHERE HE SHOUTED TO A SENTINEL AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
7148-82991-0029 AFTER SOME DELAY A WICKET IN THE GATE WAS OPENED AND THE CHIEF PERSONS OF THE PARTY WERE ALLOWED TO PASS THROUGH IT WITH THE PRISONER WHO WAS ASSIGNED TO THE CUSTODY OF A COUPLE OF ARQUEBUSIERS BY THIS TIME AN OFFICER HAD ARRIVED AND IT WAS AGREED
7148-82991-0030 AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE DUKE OF SHOREDITCH TO TAKE THE OFFENDER TO THE CURFEW TOWER ACCORDINGLY THEY CROSSED THE LOWER WARD AND PASSING BENEATH AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE SEMICIRCULAR RANGE OF HABITATIONS ALLOTTED TO THE PETTY CANONS
7148-82991-0031 TRAVERSED THE SPACE BEFORE THE WEST END OF SAINT GEORGE'S CHAPEL AND DESCENDING A SHORT FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AT THE LEFT AND THREADING A NARROW PASSAGE PRESENTLY ARRIVED AT THE ARCHED ENTRANCE IN THE CURFEW
7148-82991-0032 WHOSE HOARY WALLS SHONE BRIGHTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT THEY HAD TO KNOCK FOR SOME TIME AGAINST THE STOUT OAK DOOR BEFORE ANY NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THE SUMMONS AT LENGTH
7148-82991-0033 THE ROOF OF WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF STOUT PLANKS CROSSED BY HEAVY OAKEN RAFTERS AND SUPPORTED BY BEAMS OF THE SAME MATERIAL ON THE LEFT A STEEP LADDER LIKE FLIGHT OF WOODEN STEPS LED TO AN UPPER ROOM
7148-82991-0034 CAME TO A LOW STRONG DOOR WHICH THEY UNLOCKED AND OBTAINED ADMISSION TO A LARGE OCTANGULAR CHAMBER WITH A VAULTED ROOF AND DEEP EMBRASURES TERMINATED BY NARROW LOOPHOLES
7148-82991-0035 WITH THIS THE PARTY WITHDREW AND THE DOOR WAS FASTENED UPON THE PRISONER AN ARQUEBUSIER WAS STATIONED AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
7148-82991-0036 HAVING FULLY SATISFIED THEIR CURIOSITY SHAPED THEIR COURSE TOWARDS THE CASTLE GATE ON THEIR WAY THITHER THE EARL LOOKED ABOUT FOR MORGAN FENWOLF BUT COULD NOWHERE DISCERN HIM
7148-7763-0000 CRISIS IN MY MENTAL HISTORY ONE STAGE ONWARD FOR SOME YEARS AFTER THIS TIME I WROTE VERY LITTLE AND NOTHING REGULARLY FOR PUBLICATION AND GREAT WERE THE ADVANTAGES WHICH I DERIVED FROM THE INTERMISSION
7148-7763-0001 IT WAS OF NO COMMON IMPORTANCE TO ME AT THIS PERIOD TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST AND MATURE MY THOUGHTS FOR MY OWN MIND ONLY WITHOUT ANY IMMEDIATE CALL FOR GIVING THEM OUT IN PRINT HAD I GONE ON WRITING
7148-7763-0002 MIGHT TRULY BE CALLED AN OBJECT IN LIFE TO BE A REFORMER OF THE WORLD MY CONCEPTION OF MY OWN HAPPINESS WAS ENTIRELY IDENTIFIED WITH THIS OBJECT THE PERSONAL SYMPATHIES I WISHED FOR WERE THOSE OF FELLOW LABOURERS
7148-7763-0003 IN THIS ENTERPRISE I ENDEAVOURED TO PICK UP AS MANY FLOWERS AS I COULD BY THE WAY
7148-7763-0004 BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
7148-7763-0005 THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
7148-7763-0006 AS FROM A DREAM IT WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX I WAS IN A DULL STATE OF NERVES SUCH AS EVERYBODY IS OCCASIONALLY LIABLE TO UNSUSCEPTIBLE TO ENJOYMENT OR PLEASURABLE EXCITEMENT ONE OF THOSE MOODS
7148-7763-0007 IN THIS FRAME OF MIND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO PUT THE QUESTION DIRECTLY TO MYSELF SUPPOSE THAT ALL YOUR OBJECTS IN LIFE WERE REALIZED THAT ALL THE CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONS AND OPINIONS WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
7148-7763-0008 THE WHOLE FOUNDATION ON WHICH MY LIFE WAS CONSTRUCTED FELL DOWN ALL MY HAPPINESS WAS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE CONTINUAL PURSUIT OF THIS END THE END HAD CEASED TO CHARM AND HOW COULD THERE EVER AGAIN BE ANY INTEREST IN THE MEANS
7148-7763-0009 I AWOKE TO A RENEWED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WOFUL FACT I CARRIED IT WITH ME INTO ALL COMPANIES INTO ALL OCCUPATIONS HARDLY ANYTHING HAD POWER TO CAUSE ME EVEN A FEW MINUTES OBLIVION OF IT
7148-7763-0010 FOR SOME MONTHS THE CLOUD SEEMED TO GROW THICKER AND THICKER THE LINES IN COLERIDGE'S DEJECTION I WAS NOT THEN ACQUAINTED WITH THEM EXACTLY DESCRIBE MY CASE A GRIEF WITHOUT A PANG VOID
7148-7763-0011 IN VAIN I SOUGHT RELIEF FROM MY FAVOURITE BOOKS THOSE MEMORIALS OF PAST NOBLENESS AND GREATNESS FROM WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO DRAWN STRENGTH AND ANIMATION I READ THEM NOW WITHOUT FEELING
7148-7763-0012 OR WITH THE ACCUSTOMED FEELING MINUS ALL ITS CHARM AND I BECAME PERSUADED THAT MY LOVE OF MANKIND AND OF EXCELLENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE HAD WORN ITSELF OUT
7148-7763-0013 I SOUGHT NO COMFORT BY SPEAKING TO OTHERS OF WHAT I FELT IF I HAD LOVED ANYONE SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE CONFIDING MY GRIEFS A NECESSITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE CONDITION I WAS
7148-7763-0014 I FELT TOO THAT MINE WAS NOT AN INTERESTING OR IN ANY WAY RESPECTABLE DISTRESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO ATTRACT SYMPATHY ADVICE
7148-7763-0015 AND I SAW NO USE IN GIVING HIM THE PAIN OF THINKING THAT HIS PLANS HAD FAILED WHEN THE FAILURE WAS PROBABLY IRREMEDIABLE AND AT ALL EVENTS BEYOND THE POWER OF
7148-7763-0016 HIS REMEDIES OF OTHER FRIENDS I HAD AT THAT TIME NONE TO WHOM I HAD ANY HOPE OF MAKING MY CONDITION INTELLIGIBLE IT WAS HOWEVER ABUNDANTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO MYSELF
7148-7763-0017 AND THE MORE I DWELT UPON IT THE MORE HOPELESS IT APPEARED MY COURSE OF STUDY
7148-7763-0018 WHETHER OF A GOOD OR OF A BAD KIND WERE THE RESULTS OF ASSOCIATION THAT WE LOVE ONE THING AND HATE ANOTHER TAKE PLEASURE IN ONE SORT OF ACTION OR CONTEMPLATION
7148-7763-0019 WITH ALL THINGS BENEFICIAL TO THE GREAT WHOLE
7148-7763-0020 ALL THINGS HURTFUL TO IT THIS DOCTRINE APPEARED INEXPUGNABLE BUT IT NOW SEEMED TO ME ON RETROSPECT THAT MY TEACHERS HAD OCCUPIED THEMSELVES
7148-7763-0021 SALUTARY ASSOCIATIONS THEY SEEMED TO HAVE TRUSTED ALTOGETHER TO THE OLD FAMILIAR INSTRUMENTS PRAISE AND BLAME REWARD AND PUNISHMENT NOW
7148-7763-0022 I DID NOT DOUBT THAT BY THESE MEANS BEGUN EARLY AND APPLIED UNREMITTINGLY INTENSE ASSOCIATIONS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE ESPECIALLY OF PAIN MIGHT BE CREATED
7148-7763-0023 AND MIGHT PRODUCE DESIRES AND AVERSIONS CAPABLE OF LASTING UNDIMINISHED TO THE END OF LIFE BUT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL AND CASUAL IN ASSOCIATIONS THUS PRODUCED
7148-7763-0024 WHAT I HAD ALWAYS BEFORE RECEIVED WITH INCREDULITY THAT THE HABIT OF ANALYSIS HAS A TENDENCY TO WEAR AWAY THE FEELINGS AS INDEED IT HAS WHEN NO OTHER MENTAL HABIT IS CULTIVATED
7148-7763-0025 AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
7148-7763-0026 THAT IT ENABLES US MENTALLY TO SEPARATE IDEAS WHICH HAVE ONLY CASUALLY CLUNG TOGETHER AND NO ASSOCIATIONS WHATEVER COULD ULTIMATELY RESIST THIS DISSOLVING FORCE
7148-7763-0027 WERE IT NOT THAT WE OWE TO ANALYSIS OUR CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERMANENT SEQUENCES IN NATURE THE REAL CONNEXIONS BETWEEN THINGS NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR WILL AND FEELINGS NATURAL LAWS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IN MANY CASES
7148-7763-0028 ONE THING IS INSEPARABLE FROM ANOTHER IN FACT WHICH LAWS IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND IMAGINATIVELY REALIZED CAUSE OUR IDEAS OF THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS JOINED TOGETHER IN NATURE
7148-7763-0029 TO COHERE MORE AND MORE CLOSELY IN OUR THOUGHTS ANALYTIC HABITS MAY THUS EVEN STRENGTHEN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CAUSES AND EFFECTS MEANS AND ENDS BUT TEND ALTOGETHER TO WEAKEN THOSE WHICH ARE
7148-7763-0030 TO SPEAK FAMILIARLY A MERE MATTER OF FEELING THEY ARE THEREFORE I THOUGHT FAVOURABLE TO PRUDENCE AND CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS BUT A PERPETUAL WORM AT THE ROOT BOTH OF THE PASSIONS AND OF THE VIRTUES
7148-7763-0031 OF THE ENTIRE INSUFFICIENCY OF WHICH TO MAKE LIFE DESIRABLE NO ONE HAD A STRONGER CONVICTION THAN I HAD THESE WERE THE LAWS OF HUMAN NATURE BY WHICH AS IT SEEMED TO ME
7148-7763-0032 HAD MADE PRECOCIOUS AND PREMATURE ANALYSIS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF MY MIND I WAS THUS AS I SAID TO MYSELF LEFT STRANDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY VOYAGE WITH A WELL EQUIPPED SHIP
7148-7763-0033 AND A RUDDER BUT NO SAIL WITHOUT ANY REAL DESIRE FOR THE ENDS WHICH I HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY FITTED OUT TO WORK FOR NO DELIGHT IN VIRTUE OR THE GENERAL GOOD
7148-7763-0034 THE FOUNTAINS OF VANITY AND AMBITION SEEMED TO HAVE DRIED UP WITHIN ME AS COMPLETELY AS THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE I HAD HAD AS I REFLECTED SOME GRATIFICATION OF VANITY AT TOO EARLY AN AGE
7148-7763-0035 AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
1363-139304-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE AWAKENING BUT WARMING WAS WRONG IN THAT AN AWAKENING CAME WHAT A WONDERFULLY COMPLEX THING THIS SIMPLE SEEMING UNITY
1363-139304-0001 THE SELF WHO CAN TRACE ITS REINTEGRATION AS MORNING AFTER MORNING WE AWAKEN THE FLUX AND CONFLUENCE OF ITS COUNTLESS FACTORS INTERWEAVING REBUILDING THE DIM FIRST STIRRINGS OF THE SOUL
1363-139304-0002 THE GROWTH AND SYNTHESIS OF THE UNCONSCIOUS TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS THE SUBCONSCIOUS TO DAWNING CONSCIOUSNESS UNTIL AT LAST WE RECOGNISE OURSELVES AGAIN AND AS IT HAPPENS TO MOST OF US AFTER THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
1363-139304-0003 SO IT WAS WITH GRAHAM AT THE END OF HIS VAST SLUMBER A DIM CLOUD OF SENSATION TAKING SHAPE A CLOUDY DREARINESS AND HE FOUND HIMSELF VAGUELY SOMEWHERE RECUMBENT FAINT BUT ALIVE
1363-139304-0004 THE PILGRIMAGE TOWARDS A PERSONAL BEING SEEMED TO TRAVERSE VAST GULFS TO OCCUPY EPOCHS GIGANTIC DREAMS THAT WERE TERRIBLE REALITIES AT THE TIME
1363-139304-0005 LEFT VAGUE PERPLEXING MEMORIES STRANGE CREATURES STRANGE SCENERY AS IF FROM ANOTHER PLANET THERE WAS A DISTINCT IMPRESSION TOO OF A MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION OF A NAME
1363-139304-0006 HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
1363-139304-0007 THE EFFORT OF A MAN NEAR DROWNING IN DARKNESS THEN CAME A PANORAMA OF DAZZLING UNSTABLE CONFLUENT SCENES GRAHAM BECAME AWARE THAT HIS EYES WERE OPEN
1363-139304-0008 AND REGARDING SOME UNFAMILIAR THING IT WAS SOMETHING WHITE THE EDGE OF SOMETHING A FRAME OF WOOD HE MOVED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF THIS SHAPE
1363-139304-0009 IT WENT UP BEYOND THE TOP OF HIS EYES HE TRIED TO THINK WHERE HE MIGHT BE DID IT MATTER SEEING HE WAS SO WRETCHED
1363-139304-0010 HE FELT THE FEATURELESS MISERY OF ONE WHO WAKES TOWARDS THE HOUR OF DAWN HE HAD AN UNCERTAIN SENSE OF WHISPERS AND FOOTSTEPS HASTILY RECEDING
1363-139304-0011 THE MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD INVOLVED A PERCEPTION OF EXTREME PHYSICAL WEAKNESS HE SUPPOSED HE WAS IN BED IN THE HOTEL AT THE PLACE IN THE VALLEY BUT HE COULD NOT RECALL THAT WHITE EDGE HE MUST HAVE SLEPT
1363-139304-0012 HE REMEMBERED NOW THAT HE HAD WANTED TO SLEEP HE RECALLED THE CLIFF AND WATERFALL AGAIN AND THEN RECOLLECTED SOMETHING ABOUT TALKING TO A PASSER BY HOW LONG HAD HE SLEPT
1363-139304-0013 WHAT WAS THAT SOUND OF PATTERING FEET AND THAT RISE AND FALL LIKE THE MURMUR OF BREAKERS ON PEBBLES HE PUT OUT A LANGUID HAND TO REACH HIS WATCH FROM THE CHAIR WHEREON IT WAS HIS HABIT TO PLACE IT
1363-139304-0014 AND TOUCHED SOME SMOOTH HARD SURFACE LIKE GLASS THIS WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT STARTLED HIM EXTREMELY QUITE SUDDENLY HE ROLLED OVER STARED FOR A MOMENT AND STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSITION
1363-139304-0015 THE EFFORT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT AND IT LEFT HIM GIDDY AND WEAK AND AMAZED HE RUBBED HIS EYES THE RIDDLE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS WAS CONFUSING
1363-139304-0016 BUT HIS MIND WAS QUITE CLEAR EVIDENTLY HIS SLEEP HAD BENEFITED HIM HE WAS NOT IN A BED AT ALL AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORD BUT LYING NAKED ON A VERY SOFT AND YIELDING MATTRESS
1363-139304-0017 IN A TROUGH OF DARK GLASS THE MATTRESS WAS PARTLY TRANSPARENT A FACT HE OBSERVED WITH A SENSE OF INSECURITY AND BELOW IT WAS A MIRROR REFLECTING HIM GREYLY
1363-139304-0018 ABOUT HIS ARM AND HE SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HIS SKIN WAS STRANGELY DRY AND YELLOW WAS BOUND A CURIOUS APPARATUS OF RUBBER BOUND SO CUNNINGLY
1363-139304-0019 THAT IT SEEMED TO PASS INTO HIS SKIN ABOVE AND BELOW AND THIS BED WAS PLACED IN A CASE OF GREENISH COLOURED GLASS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM A BAR IN THE WHITE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH HAD FIRST ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0020 IN THE CORNER OF THE CASE WAS A STAND OF GLITTERING AND DELICATELY MADE APPARATUS FOR THE MOST PART QUITE STRANGE APPLIANCES THOUGH A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETER WAS RECOGNISABLE
1363-139304-0021 THE SLIGHTLY GREENISH TINT OF THE GLASS LIKE SUBSTANCE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM ON EVERY HAND OBSCURED WHAT LAY BEHIND BUT HE PERCEIVED IT WAS A VAST APARTMENT OF SPLENDID APPEARANCE
1363-139304-0022 AND WITH A VERY LARGE AND SIMPLE WHITE ARCHWAY FACING HIM CLOSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CAGE WERE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE A TABLE COVERED WITH A SILVERY CLOTH SILVERY LIKE THE SIDE OF A FISH
1363-139304-0023 A COUPLE OF GRACEFUL CHAIRS AND ON THE TABLE A NUMBER OF DISHES WITH SUBSTANCES PILED ON THEM A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES HE REALISED THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HUNGRY HE COULD SEE NO ONE
1363-139304-0024 AND AFTER A PERIOD OF HESITATION SCRAMBLED OFF THE TRANSLUCENT MATTRESS AND TRIED TO STAND ON THE CLEAN WHITE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE APARTMENT HE HAD MISCALCULATED HIS STRENGTH HOWEVER
1363-139304-0025 AND STAGGERED AND PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE GLASS LIKE PANE BEFORE HIM TO STEADY HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT IT RESISTED HIS HAND BENDING OUTWARD LIKE A DISTENDED BLADDER THEN IT BROKE WITH A SLIGHT REPORT
1363-139304-0026 AND VANISHED A PRICKED BUBBLE HE REELED OUT INTO THE GENERAL SPACE OF THE HALL GREATLY ASTONISHED HE CAUGHT AT THE TABLE TO SAVE HIMSELF KNOCKING ONE OF THE GLASSES TO THE FLOOR
1363-139304-0027 IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
1363-139304-0028 WITH A PLEASING FAINT AROMA AND TASTE AND A QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND STIMULUS HE PUT DOWN THE VESSEL AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
1363-139304-0029 THE APARTMENT LOST NONE OF ITS SIZE AND MAGNIFICENCE NOW THAT THE GREENISH TRANSPARENCY THAT HAD INTERVENED WAS REMOVED THE ARCHWAY HE SAW LED TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS GOING DOWNWARD WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATION OF A DOOR
1363-139304-0030 TO A SPACIOUS TRANSVERSE PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE RAN BETWEEN POLISHED PILLARS OF SOME WHITE VEINED SUBSTANCE OF DEEP ULTRAMARINE AND ALONG IT CAME THE SOUND OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS
1363-139304-0031 AND VOICES AND A DEEP UNDEVIATING DRONING NOTE HE SAT NOW FULLY AWAKE LISTENING ALERTLY FORGETTING THE VIANDS IN HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0032 THEN WITH A SHOCK HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS NAKED AND CASTING ABOUT HIM FOR COVERING SAW A LONG BLACK ROBE THROWN ON ONE OF THE CHAIRS BESIDE HIM THIS HE WRAPPED ABOUT HIM AND SAT DOWN AGAIN TREMBLING
1363-139304-0033 HIS MIND WAS STILL A SURGING PERPLEXITY CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT AND HAD BEEN REMOVED IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHERE AND WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE THE DISTANT CROWD BEYOND THE DEEP BLUE PILLARS
1363-139304-0034 BOSCASTLE HE POURED OUT AND PARTIALLY DRANK ANOTHER GLASS OF THE COLOURLESS FLUID WHAT WAS THIS PLACE THIS PLACE THAT TO HIS SENSES SEEMED SUBTLY QUIVERING LIKE A THING ALIVE
1363-139304-0035 HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL FORM OF THE APARTMENT UNSTAINED BY ORNAMENT AND SAW THAT THE ROOF WAS BROKEN IN ONE PLACE BY A CIRCULAR SHAFT FULL OF LIGHT
1363-139304-0036 AND AS HE LOOKED A STEADY SWEEPING SHADOW BLOTTED IT OUT AND PASSED AND CAME AGAIN AND PASSED BEAT BEAT THAT SWEEPING SHADOW HAD A NOTE OF ITS OWN IN THE SUBDUED TUMULT THAT FILLED THE AIR
1363-139304-0037 HE WOULD HAVE CALLED OUT BUT ONLY A LITTLE SOUND CAME INTO HIS THROAT THEN HE STOOD UP AND WITH THE UNCERTAIN STEPS OF A DRUNKARD MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY HE STAGGERED DOWN THE STEPS
1363-139304-0038 TRIPPED ON THE CORNER OF THE BLACK CLOAK HE HAD WRAPPED ABOUT HIMSELF AND SAVED HIMSELF BY CATCHING AT ONE OF THE BLUE PILLARS THE PASSAGE RAN DOWN A COOL VISTA OF BLUE AND PURPLE
1363-139304-0039 AND ENDED REMOTELY IN A RAILED SPACE LIKE A BALCONY BRIGHTLY LIT AND PROJECTING INTO A SPACE OF HAZE A SPACE LIKE THE INTERIOR OF SOME GIGANTIC BUILDING BEYOND AND REMOTE
1363-139304-0040 WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
1363-139304-0041 WERE THREE FIGURES RICHLY DRESSED IN LOOSE AND EASY GARMENTS OF BRIGHT SOFT COLOURINGS THE NOISE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE POURED UP OVER THE BALCONY AND ONCE IT SEEMED
1363-139304-0042 THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH
1363-139304-0043 THERE WAS A REITERATION OF WAKE HE HEARD SOME INDISTINCT SHRILL CRY AND ABRUPTLY THESE THREE MEN BEGAN LAUGHING HA HA HA LAUGHED ONE
1363-139304-0044 A RED HAIRED MAN IN A SHORT PURPLE ROBE WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES WHEN HE TURNED HIS EYES FULL OF MERRIMENT ALONG THE PASSAGE HIS FACE CHANGED THE WHOLE MAN CHANGED
1363-139304-0045 BECAME RIGID THE OTHER TWO TURNED SWIFTLY AT HIS EXCLAMATION AND STOOD MOTIONLESS THEIR FACES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF CONSTERNATION AN EXPRESSION THAT DEEPENED INTO AWE
403-216-0000 A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
403-216-0001 IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED A SOMETHING OF LANGUID INDIFFERENCE OR OF THAT BOASTED ABSENCE OF MIND WHICH CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE WOULD OCCASIONALLY COME ACROSS HER BUT HAD NOTHING WORSE APPEARED
403-216-0002 THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER IN PUBLIC ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE OFFERED
403-216-0003 BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
403-216-0004 AND SHE THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP ROOM HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0005 SHE WISHED BY A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION AND MAKE HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE EITHER OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER
403-216-0006 IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
403-216-0007 AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART BUT HIS OWN BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH
403-216-0008 WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0009 MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
403-216-0010 THE LONGER HE STAYS THE WORSE IT WILL BE FOR HIM AT LAST PRAY ADVISE HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE TO LEAVE BATH DIRECTLY ABSENCE WILL IN TIME MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AGAIN BUT HE CAN HAVE NO HOPE HERE
403-216-0011 HENRY SMILED AND SAID I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND BUT PARDON ME
403-216-0012 I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
403-216-0013 NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME SO BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING YES VERY SURE IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE
403-216-0014 OR MISS THORPE'S ADMISSION OF THEM THAT GIVES THE PAIN
403-216-0015 I THINK MISTER MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE NO MAN IS OFFENDED BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND AND SAID
403-216-0016 ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
403-216-0017 YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
403-216-0018 AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
403-216-0019 IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
403-216-0020 YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
403-216-0021 WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
403-216-0022 AFTER SOME MOMENTS CONSIDERATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS AT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENTIONS FROM ALL THIS BUT I AM SURE I CANNOT BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT
403-216-0023 SURE IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO HIM HE WOULD GO MY DEAR MISS MORLAND SAID HENRY IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR BROTHER'S COMFORT MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN
403-216-0024 ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
403-216-0025 IS HE SAFE ONLY IN SOLITUDE OR IS HER HEART CONSTANT TO HIM ONLY WHEN UNSOLICITED BY ANYONE ELSE HE CANNOT THINK THIS AND YOU MAY BE SURE
403-216-0026 PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
403-216-0027 HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
403-216-0028 THE MESS ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S PASSION FOR A MONTH CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT
403-128339-0000 PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND DETERMINED JURY SAT EVERY DAY THEIR LISTS WENT FORTH EVERY EVENING
403-128339-0001 COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
403-128339-0002 CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
403-128339-0003 AND TWO HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILLOTINED AND FORGOTTEN THE LIST WAS READ IN THE VAULTED CHAMBER WHERE DARNAY HAD SEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRISONERS ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD PERISHED IN THE MASSACRE
403-128339-0004 EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
403-128339-0005 AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
403-128339-0006 WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
403-128339-0007 BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
403-128339-0008 AND ALL OF US HAVE LIKE WONDERS HIDDEN IN OUR BREASTS ONLY NEEDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO EVOKE THEM THE PASSAGE TO THE CONCIERGERIE WAS SHORT AND DARK
403-128339-0009 THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
403-128339-0010 SOME DAGGERS SOME ATE AND DRANK AS THEY LOOKED ON MANY KNITTED AMONG THESE LAST WAS ONE WITH A SPARE PIECE OF KNITTING UNDER HER ARM AS SHE WORKED SHE WAS IN A FRONT ROW BY THE SIDE OF A MAN
403-128339-0011 BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
403-128339-0012 AND THEY LOOKED AT THE JURY BUT AT NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT SAT DOCTOR MANETTE IN HIS USUAL QUIET DRESS AS WELL AS THE PRISONER COULD SEE HE AND MISTER LORRY WERE THE ONLY MEN THERE UNCONNECTED WITH THE TRIBUNAL
403-128339-0013 WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
403-128339-0014 WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
403-128339-0015 HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN FRANCE AND HIS HEAD WAS DEMANDED TAKE OFF HIS HEAD CRIED THE AUDIENCE AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO SILENCE THOSE CRIES
403-128339-0016 UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS WAS HE NOT AN EMIGRANT THEN WHAT DID HE CALL HIMSELF NOT AN EMIGRANT HE HOPED WITHIN THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT DESIRED TO KNOW
403-128339-0017 BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
403-128339-0018 TO LIVE BY HIS OWN INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND RATHER THAN ON THE INDUSTRY OF THE OVERLADEN PEOPLE OF FRANCE WHAT PROOF HAD HE OF THIS HE HANDED IN THE NAMES OF TWO WITNESSES THEOPHILE GABELLE AND ALEXANDRE MANETTE
403-128339-0019 THE PRESIDENT REMINDED HIM TRUE BUT NOT AN ENGLISH WOMAN A CITIZENESS OF FRANCE YES BY BIRTH HER NAME AND FAMILY
403-128339-0020 LUCIE MANETTE ONLY DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MANETTE THE GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO SITS THERE THIS ANSWER HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE CRIES IN EXALTATION OF THE WELL KNOWN GOOD PHYSICIAN RENT THE HALL
403-128339-0021 ON THESE FEW STEPS OF HIS DANGEROUS WAY CHARLES DARNAY HAD SET HIS FOOT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MANETTE'S REITERATED INSTRUCTIONS THE SAME CAUTIOUS COUNSEL DIRECTED EVERY STEP THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
403-128339-0022 AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
403-128339-0023 WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
403-128339-0024 HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
403-128339-0025 NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
403-128339-0026 THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
403-128339-0027 BUT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WOULD BE FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS THEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN CARE THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE HAD ASSURED HIM THAT IT WOULD BE THERE
403-128339-0028 THAT IN THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS IMPOSED ON THE TRIBUNAL BY THE MULTITUDE OF ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WHICH IT HAD TO DEAL HE HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED IN HIS PRISON OF THE ABBAYE IN FACT
403-128339-0029 BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
403-128339-0030 BUT AS HE PROCEEDED AS HE SHOWED THAT THE ACCUSED WAS HIS FIRST FRIEND ON HIS RELEASE FROM HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT THAT THE ACCUSED HAD REMAINED IN ENGLAND ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF IN THEIR EXILE THAT
403-128339-0031 SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
403-128339-0032 AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
403-128339-0033 HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
403-128339-0034 THE JURYMEN VOTED ALOUD AND INDIVIDUALLY THE POPULACE SET UP A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE ALL THE VOICES WERE IN THE PRISONER'S FAVOUR AND THE PRESIDENT DECLARED HIM FREE
403-128339-0035 THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
403-128339-0036 OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
403-128339-0037 WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
403-128339-0038 THAT AFTER HIS LONG AND UNWHOLESOME CONFINEMENT HE WAS IN DANGER OF FAINTING FROM EXHAUSTION NONE THE LESS BECAUSE HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE CARRIED BY ANOTHER CURRENT WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT HIM WITH THE VERY SAME INTENSITY
403-128339-0039 TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
403-128339-0040 FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
403-128339-0041 THAT THESE FIVE CAME DOWN TO HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE CONDEMNED TO DIE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FIRST OF THEM TOLD HIM SO WITH THE CUSTOMARY PRISON SIGN OF DEATH A RAISED FINGER AND THEY ALL ADDED IN WORDS
403-128339-0042 LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
403-128339-0043 IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
403-128339-0044 UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
403-128339-0045 IN WINDING AND TRAMPING THROUGH THEM AS THEY HAD REDDENED THEM BELOW THE SNOW WITH A DEEPER DYE THEY CARRIED HIM THUS INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HER FATHER HAD GONE ON BEFORE TO PREPARE HER
403-128339-0046 AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
403-128339-0047 SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
403-128339-0048 AFTER GRASPING THE DOCTOR'S HAND AS HE STOOD VICTORIOUS AND PROUD BEFORE HIM AFTER GRASPING THE HAND OF MISTER LORRY
403-128339-0049 AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
403-128339-0050 LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
403-128339-0051 NO OTHER MAN IN ALL THIS FRANCE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON HER FATHER'S BREAST AS SHE HAD LAID HIS POOR HEAD ON HER OWN BREAST LONG LONG AGO HE WAS HAPPY IN THE RETURN HE HAD MADE HER
403-128339-0052 HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
229-130880-0000 RIGHT OFF I OBSERVED A CLUSTER OF MOUNTAINS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH WHOSE SHAPES WERE VERY WHIMSICALLY SCULPTED AFTER OUR POSITION FIX I REENTERED THE LOUNGE AND WHEN OUR BEARINGS WERE REPORTED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE OFF THE ISLAND OF CEYLON
229-130880-0001 THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE
229-130880-0002 REENTERING THE LOUNGE I FIRST NOTED THE BEARINGS OF CEYLON ON WHICH ANTIQUITY LAVISHED SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES
229-130880-0003 ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
229-130880-0004 IN OTHER WORDS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT OF IRELAND JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED THE CAPTAIN GLANCED AT THE CHART THEN TURNING TO ME THE ISLAND OF CEYLON HE SAID
229-130880-0005 IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
229-130880-0006 CERTAINLY CAPTAIN FINE IT'S EASILY DONE ONLY WHEN WE SEE THE FISHERIES WE'LL SEE NO FISHERMEN
229-130880-0007 AND WE'LL ARRIVE THERE LATE TONIGHT
229-130880-0008 WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
229-130880-0009 I FOUND IT BY THE NINTH PARALLEL OFF THE NORTHWESTERN SHORES OF CEYLON
229-130880-0010 TO REACH IT WE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO THEN TOLD ME THERE ARE PEARL FISHERIES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
229-130880-0011 THE SEAS OF CHINA AND JAPAN PLUS THOSE SEAS SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE GULF OF PANAMA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S OFF CEYLON THAT SUCH FISHING REAPS ITS RICHEST REWARDS NO DOUBT WE'LL BE ARRIVING A LITTLE EARLY
229-130880-0012 ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME THREE HUNDRED BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS
229-130880-0013 DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID
229-130880-0014 THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
229-130880-0015 ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
229-130880-0016 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
229-130880-0017 THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
229-130880-0018 I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
229-130880-0019 I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE TIME UNDERWATER THAT THESE FISHERMEN CAN TOLERATE IS THIRTY SECONDS DURING WHICH THEY HASTILY STUFF THEIR LITTLE NETS WITH ALL THE PEARL OYSTERS THEY CAN TEAR LOOSE
229-130880-0020 THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION
229-130880-0021 AND ONE THAT EXISTS ONLY TO GRATIFY THE WHIMS OF FASHION BUT TELL ME CAPTAIN HOW MANY OYSTERS CAN A BOAT FISH UP IN A WORKDAY
229-130880-0022 IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP SEVENTY SIX MILLION OYSTERS
229-130880-0023 THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
229-130880-0024 ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
229-130880-0025 AND IF BY CHANCE SOME EAGER FISHERMAN ARRIVES EARLY WELL WE CAN WATCH HIM AT WORK THAT SUITS ME CAPTAIN BY THE WAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF SHARKS ARE YOU SHARKS I EXCLAIMED
229-130880-0026 THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM
229-130880-0027 THE REST OF US CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE TOO ANYHOW WE'LL BE ARMED AND ON OUR WAY WE MIGHT HUNT A MAN EATER OR TWO IT'S A FASCINATING SPORT SO PROFESSOR I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
229-130880-0028 BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW
229-130880-0029 IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY HA NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
229-130880-0030 YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE ACCEPTING AS FOR ME I PASSED A HAND OVER MY BROW WHERE BEADS OF COLD SWEAT WERE BUSY FORMING LET'S THINK THIS OVER I SAID TO MYSELF AND LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
229-130880-0031 HUNTING OTTERS IN UNDERWATER FORESTS AS WE DID IN THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND IS AN ACCEPTABLE ACTIVITY
229-130880-0032 THAT'S ANOTHER STORY I KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS NEGROES DON'T HESITATE TO ATTACK SHARKS DAGGER IN ONE HAND AND NOOSE IN THE OTHER
229-130880-0033 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY WHO FACE THOSE FEARSOME ANIMALS DON'T COME BACK ALIVE BESIDES I'M NOT A NEGRO AND EVEN IF I WERE A NEGRO IN THIS INSTANCE I DON'T THINK A LITTLE HESITATION ON MY PART WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE
229-130880-0034 AND THERE I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT SHARKS ENVISIONING HUGE JAWS ARMED WITH MULTIPLE ROWS OF TEETH AND CAPABLE OF CUTTING A MAN IN HALF I COULD ALREADY FEEL A DEFINITE PAIN AROUND MY PELVIC GIRDLE
229-130880-0035 AND HOW I RESENTED THE OFFHAND MANNER IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS DEPLORABLE INVITATION
229-130880-0036 THANK HEAVENS I SAID TO MYSELF CONSEIL WILL NEVER WANT TO COME ALONG AND THAT'LL BE MY EXCUSE FOR NOT GOING WITH THE CAPTAIN AS FOR NED LAND I ADMIT I FELT LESS CONFIDENT OF HIS WISDOM
229-130880-0037 DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE OPEN JAWS

229-130880-0044 FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER
229-130880-0045 CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT

229-130880-0055 THAT VALUABLE SHELLFISH PEARLS RESULT SIMPLY FROM MOTHER OF PEARL SOLIDIFYING INTO A GLOBULAR SHAPE EITHER THEY STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL OR THEY BECOME EMBEDDED IN THE CREATURE'S FOLDS
229-130880-0056 ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND
229-130880-0057 AROUND WHICH THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS DEPOSITED IN THIN CONCENTRIC LAYERS OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN SUCCESSION CAN ONE FIND SEVERAL PEARLS IN THE SAME OYSTER CONSEIL ASKED YES MY BOY
229-130880-0058 THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS
229-130880-0059 NED LAND YELPED DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY I MEANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEARLS SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
229-130880-0060 BUT WILL MASTER NOW TELL US HOW ONE GOES ABOUT EXTRACTING THESE PEARLS ONE PROCEEDS IN SEVERAL WAYS AND OFTEN WHEN PEARLS STICK TO THE VALVES FISHERMEN EVEN PULL THEM LOOSE WITH PLIERS
229-130880-0061 THUS THEY DIE IN THE OPEN AIR AND BY THE END OF TEN DAYS THEY'VE ROTTED SUFFICIENTLY NEXT THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HUGE TANKS OF SALT WATER THEN THEY'RE OPENED UP AND WASHED AT THIS POINT THE SORTERS BEGIN THEIR TWOFOLD TASK
229-130880-0062 FIRST THEY REMOVE THE LAYERS OF MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY BY THE NAMES LEGITIMATE SILVER BASTARD WHITE OR BASTARD BLACK
229-130880-0063 THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED
229-130880-0064 BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAPE THEIR WATER IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COLOR AND THEIR ORIENT IN OTHER WORDS THAT DAPPLED SHIMMERING GLOW THAT MAKES THEM SO DELIGHTFUL TO THE EYE THE FINEST PEARLS ARE CALLED VIRGIN PEARLS OR PARAGONS
229-130880-0065 THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR SHAPED THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
229-130880-0066 THE PEAR SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER
229-130880-0067 THE SMALLEST PEARLS ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME SEED PEARLS THEY'RE PRICED BY THE MEASURING CUP AND ARE USED MAINLY IN THE CREATION OF EMBROIDERY FOR CHURCH VESTMENTS BUT IT MUST BE A LONG HARD JOB SORTING OUT THESE PEARLS BY SIZE
229-130880-0068 THE CANADIAN SAID NO MY FRIEND THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
229-130880-0069 THOSE NOT SLIPPING THROUGH THE SIEVES PIERCED WITH ONE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED HOLES ARE IN THE SECOND ORDER FINALLY THOSE PEARLS FOR WHICH ONE USES STRAINERS PIERCED WITH NINE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND HOLES MAKE UP THE SEED PEARLS
229-130880-0070 HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
229-130880-0071 THESE CEYLON FISHERIES ARE FARMED ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL PROFIT OF THREE MILLION MAN EATERS FRANCS CONSEIL REBUKED YES FRANCS THREE MILLION FRANCS I WENT ON
229-130880-0072 BUT I DON'T THINK THESE FISHERIES BRING IN THE RETURNS THEY ONCE DID SIMILARLY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FISHERIES
229-130880-0073 BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
229-130880-0074 HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
229-130880-0075 I'VE EVEN HEARD STORIES THE CANADIAN SAID ABOUT SOME LADY IN ANCIENT TIMES WHO DRANK PEARLS IN VINEGAR CLEOPATRA CONSEIL SHOT BACK IT MUST HAVE TASTED PRETTY BAD NED LAND ADDED ABOMINABLE NED MY FRIEND
229-130880-0076 CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHEN A LITTLE GLASS OF VINEGAR IS WORTH ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ITS TASTE IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
229-130880-0077 NED LAND MARRIED TO CLEOPATRA CONSEIL EXCLAIMED BUT I WAS ALL SET TO TIE THE KNOT CONSEIL THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
229-130880-0078 I EVEN BOUGHT A PEARL NECKLACE FOR MY FIANCEE KATE TENDER BUT SHE MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE INSTEAD
229-130880-0079 BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG
229-130880-0080 MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
229-130880-0081 THAT ESSENCE OF ORIENT MUST SELL FOR QUITE A LARGE SUM AS LITTLE AS ZERO IT COMES FROM THE SCALES OF A EUROPEAN CARP IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SILVER SUBSTANCE THAT COLLECTS IN THE WATER AND IS PRESERVED IN AMMONIA IT'S WORTHLESS
229-130880-0082 MAYBE THAT'S WHY KATE TENDER MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE REPLIED MISTER LAND PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT I SAID GETTING BACK TO PEARLS OF GREAT VALUE I DON'T THINK ANY SOVEREIGN EVER POSSESSED ONE SUPERIOR TO THE PEARL OWNED BY CAPTAIN NEMO
229-130880-0083 THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE EXACTLY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT TWO MILLION UH FRANCS
229-130880-0084 CONSEIL SAID QUICKLY YES I SAID TWO MILLION FRANCS AND NO DOUBT ALL IT COST OUR CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFORT TO PICK IT UP HA NED LAND EXCLAIMED DURING OUR STROLL TOMORROW WHO SAYS WE WON'T RUN INTO ONE JUST LIKE IT

229-130880-0086 SHAKING HIS HEAD IN FACT I SAID MISTER LAND IS RIGHT AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT
229-130880-0087 THE CANADIAN SAID BUT SAID CONSEIL WHO PERPETUALLY RETURNED TO THE DIDACTIC SIDE OF THINGS IS THIS PEARL FISHING EVER DANGEROUS NO I REPLIED QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF ONE TAKES CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS

1334-135589-0014 AND A SEVERE ACTION WAS FOUGHT IN THE STREETS OF THE SUBURB OF SAINT ANTOINE IN WHICH NEITHER PARTY HAD THE ADVANTAGE
1334-135589-0015 AND NOT RECEIVING THE ASSISTANCE HE EXPECTED FROM THE SPANIARDS HE FELL BACK TO THE FRONTIERS OF CHAMPAGNE PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE FROM PARIS EDWARD HAD RECEIVED HUMPHREY'S LETTER EXPLAINING AWAY THE INTENDANT'S CONDUCT
1334-135589-0016 AND THE CONTENTS REMOVED A HEAVY LOAD FROM EDWARD'S MIND BUT HE NOW THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT WAR AND ALTHOUGH HE CHERISHED THE IDEA OF PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE HE WAS RESOLVED TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF THE PRINCE AS LONG AS HE COULD
1334-135589-0017 HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE INTENDANT THANKING HIM FOR HIS KIND FEELINGS AND INTENTIONS TOWARD HIM AND HE TRUSTED THAT HE MIGHT ONE DAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM AGAIN HE DID NOT HOWEVER THINK IT ADVISABLE TO MENTION THE NAME OF HIS DAUGHTER
1334-135589-0018 EXCEPT IN INQUIRING AFTER HER HEALTH AND SENDING HIS RESPECTS IT MAY BE YEARS BEFORE I SEE HER AGAIN THOUGHT EDWARD AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN
1334-135589-0019 AND EDWARD WITH HIS FRIENDS FOLLOWED HIS FORTUNES AND GAINED HIS GOOD WILL THEY WERE RAPIDLY PROMOTED TIME FLEW ON AND IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR THE COURT OF FRANCE CONCLUDED AN ALLIANCE WITH CROMWELL

1334-135589-0022 EDWARD WHO BUT RARELY HEARD FROM HUMPHREY WAS NOW ANXIOUS TO QUIT THE ARMY AND GO TO THE KING WHO WAS IN SPAIN BUT TO LEAVE HIS COLORS WHILE THINGS WERE ADVERSE WAS IMPOSSIBLE
1334-135589-0023 AFTER THE PEACE AND THE PARDON OF CONDE BY THE FRENCH KING THE ARMIES WERE DISBANDED AND THE THREE ADVENTURERS WERE FREE THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE OF THE PRINCE WHO THANKED THEM FOR THEIR LONG AND MERITORIOUS SERVICES

1334-135589-0047 AND FEEL THAT ALL HE ASSERTED TO HUMPHREY IS TRUE STILL I DO NOT LIKE THAT I SHOULD BE INDEBTED TO HIM FOR A PROPERTY WHICH IS MINE AND THAT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO GIVE I ACKNOWLEDGE HIS GENEROSITY
1334-135589-0048 BUT I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HIS RIGHT OF POSSESSION NAY MUCH AS I ADMIRE AND I MAY SAY FOND AS I AM FOR TIME HAS NOT EFFACED THE FEELING OF HIS DAUGHTER IT STILL APPEARS TO ME THAT

1334-135589-0052 HE CAN NOT REFUSE IT PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES BROTHER REPLIED ALICE I DOUBT IF THE KING OR HIS COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE TO MAKE SO MANY DISCONTENTED
1334-135589-0053 WHICH HAS BEEN SO LONG HELD BY OTHERS
1334-135589-0054 RECOLLECT ALSO THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW SIR ASHLEY COOPER HAVE DONE THE KING MUCH MORE SERVICE THAN YOU EVER HAVE OR CAN DO THEY HAVE BEEN MOST IMPORTANT AGENTS IN HIS RESTORATION
1334-135589-0055 AND THE KING'S OBLIGATIONS TO THEM ARE MUCH GREATER THAN THEY ARE TO YOU BESIDES MERELY FOR WHAT MAY BE CALLED A POINT OF HONOR FOR IT IS NO MORE IN WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION WILL YOU PUT HIS MAJESTY
1334-135589-0056 AT ALL EVENTS EDWARD RECOLLECT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE INTENTIONS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE PROFFERS FIRST BUT MY DEAR SISTER IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE EVIDENT
1334-135589-0057 WHY HAS HE REBUILT ARNWOOD HE IS NOT GOING TO SURRENDER MY PROPERTY AND MAKE ME A PRESENT OF THE HOUSE
1334-135589-0058 YOU WERE AT THE WARS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT RETURN HE SAID THIS TO HUMPHREY WHO HAS ALL ALONG BEEN ACTING AS HIS FACTOTUM IN THE BUSINESS AND RECOLLECT AT THE TIME THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE COMMENCED THE REBUILDING OF THE MANSION
1334-135589-0059 WHAT PROSPECT WAS THERE OF THE RESTORATION OF THE KING OR OF YOUR EVER BEING IN A POSITION TO APPLY FOR THE RESTORATION OF YOUR PROPERTY I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT HUMPHREY KNOWS MORE OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS THAN HE HAS MADE KNOWN TO US
1334-135589-0060 AND I THEREFORE SAY AGAIN MY DEAR EDWARD MAKE NO APPLICATION TILL YOU ASCERTAIN WHAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS MAY BE YOUR ADVICE IS GOOD MY DEAR ALICE AND I WILL BE GUIDED BY IT REPLIED EDWARD
1334-135589-0061 AND NOW LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE FOR YOUR FRIENDS MASTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE THAT MUCH OF THEIR PROPERTY HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND PUT INTO OTHER HANDS I KNOW AND PROBABLY THEY EXPECT IT WILL BE RESTORED UPON THEIR APPLICATION TO THE KING
1334-135589-0062 THOSE WHO HOLD THE PROPERTY THINK SO TOO AND SO FAR IT IS FORTUNATE NOW FROM WISER HEADS THAN MINE
1334-135589-0063 BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY WERE TO MEET THE PARTIES AND CLOSE WITH THEM AT ONCE BEFORE THE KING'S INTENTIONS ARE KNOWN THEY WOULD RECOVER THEIR PROPERTY AT A THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE VALUE NOW IS THEIR TIME
1334-135589-0064 EVEN A FEW DAYS DELAY MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THEY CAN EASILY OBTAIN A DELAY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE MONEYS IMPRESS THAT UPON THEM MY DEAR EDWARD
1334-135589-0065 AND MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT IS ADVICE WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED REPLIED EDWARD WE MUST GO NOW AND I WILL NOT FAIL TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THEM THIS VERY NIGHT WE MAY AS WELL HERE INFORM THE READER
1334-135589-0066 THAT THE ADVICE WAS IMMEDIATELY ACTED UPON AND THAT CHALONER AND GRENVILLE RECOVERED ALL THEIR ESTATES AT ABOUT FIVE YEARS PURCHASE EDWARD REMAINED AT COURT SEVERAL DAYS HE HAD WRITTEN TO HUMPHREY AND HAD DISPATCHED A MESSENGER WITH THE LETTER
1334-135589-0067 BUT THE MESSENGER HAD NOT YET RETURNED
1334-135589-0068 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRAWING ROOM WAS TO BE HELD AND EDWARD'S SISTERS WERE TO BE PRESENTED EDWARD WAS STANDING WITH MANY OTHERS OF THE SUIT BEHIND THE CHAIR OF THE KING AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THE PRESENTATIONS AS THEY TOOK PLACE
1334-135589-0069 AND WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SISTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE WERE NOT WITH HIM THEY HAD OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE OBJECT WE HAVE BEFORE REFERRED TO WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT ADVANCING TOWARD THE KING
1334-135589-0070 MISTER HEATHERSTONE WHO LED HIS DAUGHTER PATIENCE THAT THEY HAD NOT PERCEIVED HIM WAS EVIDENT INDEED HER EYES WERE NOT RAISED ONCE FROM THE NATURAL TIMIDITY FELT BY A YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY
1334-135589-0071 EDWARD HALF CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE MIGHT GAZE UPON HER WITHOUT RESERVE
1334-135589-0072 BUT LITTLE ALTERED EXCEPT HAVING GROWN TALLER AND MORE ROUNDED AND PERFECT IN HER FIGURE AND HER COURT DRESS DISPLAYED PROPORTIONS WHICH HER HUMBLE COSTUME AT THE NEW FOREST HAD CONCEALED OR WHICH TIME HAD NOT MATURED
1334-135589-0073 THERE WAS THE SAME PENSIVE SWEET EXPRESSION IN HER FACE WHICH HAD ALTERED LITTLE BUT THE BEAUTIFUL ROUNDED ARMS
1334-135589-0074 AND THE PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE FIGURE WAS A SURPRISE TO HIM AND EDWARD IN HIS OWN MIND AGREED THAT SHE MIGHT WELL BE THE REIGNING TOAST OF THE DAY MISTER HEATHERSTONE ADVANCED AND MADE HIS OBEISANCE
1334-135589-0075 AND THEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS LED FORWARD AND INTRODUCED BY A LADY UNKNOWN TO EDWARD AFTER HE HAD SALUTED HER THE KING SAID LOUD ENOUGH FOR EDWARD TO HEAR
1334-135589-0076 I TRUST THAT THE DAUGHTER WILL OFTEN GRACE OUR COURT PATIENCE MADE NO REPLY BUT PASSED ON AND SOON AFTERWARD EDWARD LOST SIGHT OF HER IN THE CROWD
1334-135589-0077 AND TIME AND ABSENCE HAVE THEIR EFFECT UPON THE MOST ARDENT OF LOVERS THE SIGHT OF HER SO RESPLENDENT IN BEAUTY ACTED UPON HIM LIKE MAGIC AND HE WAS UNEASY TILL THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND HE WAS ENABLED TO GO TO HIS SISTERS
1334-135589-0078 WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE ARMS OF HUMPHREY WHO HAD ARRIVED WITH THE MESSENGER AFTER THE GREETINGS WERE OVER EDWARD SAID ALICE AND I HAVE SEEN PATIENCE AND I FEAR I MUST SURRENDER AT DISCRETION
1334-135589-0079 MISTER HEATHERSTONE MAY MAKE HIS OWN TERMS I MUST WAVE ALL PRIDE RATHER THAN LOSE HER I THOUGHT THAT I HAD MORE CONTROL OVER MYSELF BUT I HAVE SEEN HER AND FEEL THAT MY FUTURE HAPPINESS DEPENDS UPON OBTAINING HER AS A WIFE
1334-135589-0080 LET HER FATHER BUT GIVE ME HER AND ARNWOOD WILL BE BUT A TRIFLE IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU ARE TO POSSESS ARNWOOD SAID HUMPHREY I CAN INFORM YOU WHAT THEY ARE
1334-135589-0081 THEY ARE WHOLLY UNSHACKLED FURTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE TO REPAY BY INSTALLMENTS THE MONEY EXPENDED IN THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE THIS I AM EMPOWERED TO STATE TO YOU AND I THINK YOU WILL ALLOW THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE
1334-135589-0082 HAS FULLY ACTED UP TO WHAT HE STATED WERE HIS VIEWS WHEN HE FIRST OBTAINED A GRANT OF THE PROPERTY HE HAS INDEED REPLIED EDWARD AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER EDWARD YOU HAVE YET TO WIN HER AND WEAR HER
1334-135589-0083 AS THE SAYING IS HER FATHER WILL RESIGN THE PROPERTY TO YOU AS YOURS BY RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NO PROPERTY IN HIS DAUGHTER AND I SUSPECT THAT SHE WILL NOT BE QUITE SO EASILY HANDED OVER TO YOU
1334-135589-0084 BUT WHY SHOULD YOU SAY SO HUMPHREY HAVE WE NOT BEEN ATTACHED FROM OUR YOUTH YES IT WAS A YOUTHFUL PASSION I GRANT BUT RECOLLECT NOTHING CAME OF IT AND YEARS HAVE PASSED AWAY
1334-135589-0085 IT IS NOW SEVEN YEARS SINCE YOU QUITTED THE FOREST AND IN YOUR LETTERS TO MISTER HEATHERSTONE YOU MADE NO REMARK UPON WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND PATIENCE SINCE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER CORRESPONDED OR SENT ANY MESSAGES
1334-135589-0086 AND YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT THAT A GIRL FROM THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR WILL CHERISH THE IMAGE OF ONE WHO TO SAY THE LEAST HAD TREATED HER WITH INDIFFERENCE THAT IS MY VIEW OF THE MATTER EDWARD IT MAY BE WRONG
1334-135589-0087 AND IT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED EDWARD MOURNFULLY WELL
1334-135589-0088 YOU KNOW HUMPHREY HOW MANY OFFERS PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE HAS HAD AND HAS EVERY DAY I MAY SAY
1334-135589-0089 TO A PROUD BROTHER OF MINE WHO DOES NOT DESERVE HER IT MAY BE SO EDITH REPLIED HUMPHREY WOMEN ARE RIDDLES I ONLY ARGUED UPON THE COMMON SENSE OF THE THING MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT WOMEN
1334-135589-0090 REPLIED EDITH TO BE SURE YOU DO NOT MEET MANY IN THE NEW FOREST WHERE YOU HAVE LIVED ALL YOUR LIFE VERY TRUE MY DEAR SISTER PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON THAT THE NEW FOREST HAS HAD SUCH CHARMS FOR ME

1334-135589-0095 TELL HIM THAT I HAVE JUST MADE KNOWN TO YOU HIS NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED CONDUCT YOU ARE RIGHT I WILL I FEAR HOWEVER HUMPHREY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND EDITH WRONG AS REGARDS HIS DAUGHTER
1334-135589-0096 NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
1334-135589-0097 ON MISTER HEATHERSTONE REPEATING TO HIM HIS INTENTIONS RELATIVE TO ARNWOOD EXPRESSED HIS SENSE OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT SIMPLY ADDING YOU MAY THINK ME IMPETUOUS SIR BUT I TRUST YOU WILL BELIEVE ME GRATEFUL
1334-135589-0098 PATIENCE COLORED UP AND TREMBLED WHEN EDWARD FIRST SAW HER EDWARD DID NOT REFER TO THE PAST FOR SOME TIME AFTER THEY HAD RENEWED THEIR ACQUAINTANCE HE WOOED HER AGAIN AND WON HER
1334-135589-0099 THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE RESTORATION THERE WAS A FETE AT HAMPTON COURT GIVEN IN HONOR OF THREE MARRIAGES TAKING PLACE EDWARD BEVERLEY TO PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE CHALONER
1334-135589-0100 TO ALICE AND GRENVILLE TO EDITH AND AS HIS MAJESTY HIMSELF SAID AS HE GAVE AWAY THE BRIDES COULD LOYALTY BE BETTER REWARDED BUT OUR YOUNG READERS WILL NOT BE CONTENT IF THEY DO NOT HEAR
1334-135589-0101 SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE OTHER PERSONAGES WHO HAVE APPEARED IN OUR LITTLE HISTORY HUMPHREY MUST TAKE THE FIRST PLACE HIS LOVE OF FARMING CONTINUED EDWARD GAVE HIM A LARGE FARM RENT FREE
1334-135589-0102 AND IN A FEW YEARS HUMPHREY SAVED UP SUFFICIENT TO PURCHASE A PROPERTY FOR HIMSELF HE THEN MARRIED CLARA RATCLIFFE WHO HAS NOT APPEARED LATELY ON THE SCENE OWING TO HER HAVING BEEN ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE RESTORATION
1334-135589-0103 CLAIMED BY AN ELDERLY RELATION WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND WHOSE INFIRM STATE OF HEALTH DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO QUIT THE HOUSE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY TO CLARA ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO HUMPHREY
1334-135589-0104 THE COTTAGE IN THE NEW FOREST WAS HELD BY AND EVENTUALLY MADE OVER TO PABLO WHO BECAME A VERY STEADY CHARACTER AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME MARRIED A YOUNG GIRL FROM ARNWOOD AND HAD A HOUSEFUL OF YOUNG GIPSIES
1334-135589-0105 OSWALD SO SOON AS EDWARD CAME DOWN TO ARNWOOD GAVE UP HIS PLACE IN THE NEW FOREST AND LIVED ENTIRELY WITH EDWARD AS HIS STEWARD AND PHOEBE ALSO WENT TO ARNWOOD AND LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE
1334-135589-0106 IN THE CAPACITY OF HOUSEKEEPER HER TEMPER BECOMING RATHER WORSE THAN BETTER AS SHE ADVANCED IN YEARS THIS IS ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT RELATIVE TO THE SEVERAL PARTIES
4830-25904-0000 BEING ALONE IN LONDON YET WISHING TO CELEBRATE THE DAY I DECIDED TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE LIONS AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS A LOVELY PLACE IT WAS AND I ENJOYED MYSELF IMMENSELY FOR MAY DAY IN ENGLAND IS JUST WHAT IT SHOULD BE
4830-25904-0001 MILD SUNNY FLOWERY AND SPRING LIKE AS I WALKED ALONG THE WELL KEPT PATHS BETWEEN WHITE AND ROSY HAWTHORN HEDGES I KEPT COMING UPON NEW AND CURIOUS SIGHTS
4830-25904-0002 FOR THE BIRDS AND BEASTS ARE SO SKILFULLY ARRANGED THAT IT IS MORE LIKE TRAVELLING THROUGH A STRANGE AND PLEASANT COUNTRY THAN VISITING A MENAGERIE THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS A GREAT AMERICAN BISON
4830-25904-0003 AND I WAS SO GLAD TO MEET WITH ANY ONE FROM HOME THAT I'D HAVE PATTED HIM WITH PLEASURE IF HE HAD SHOWN ANY CORDIALITY TOWARD ME HE DIDN'T HOWEVER
4830-25904-0004 AND PUT DOWN HIS IMMENSE HEAD WITH A SULLEN SNORT AS IF HE'D HAVE TOSSED ME WITH GREAT SATISFACTION I DID NOT BLAME HIM FOR THE POOR FELLOW WAS HOMESICK DOUBTLESS FOR HIS OWN WIDE PRAIRIES AND THE FREE LIFE HE HAD LOST
4830-25904-0005 SO I THREW HIM SOME FRESH CLOVER AND WENT ON TO THE PELICANS I NEVER KNEW BEFORE WHAT HANDSOME BIRDS THEY WERE NOT GRACEFUL BUT WITH SUCH SNOWY PLUMAGE TINGED WITH PALE PINK AND FAINT YELLOW
4830-25904-0006 THEY HAD JUST HAD THEIR BATH AND STOOD ARRANGING THEIR FEATHERS WITH THEIR GREAT BILLS
4830-25904-0007 WHEN FED THEY GOBBLED UP THE FISH NEVER STOPPING TO SWALLOW IT TILL THE POUCHES UNDER THEIR BILLS WERE FULL THEN THEY LEISURELY EMPTIED THEM AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEIR LUNCH WITH THE GRAVE DELIBERATION OF REGULAR ENGLISHMEN
4830-25904-0008 AND THERE FOUND A SPLENDID SIGHT SIX LIONS AND LIONESSES IN THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT CAGES SITTING OR STANDING IN DIGNIFIED ATTITUDES AND EYEING THE SPECTATORS WITH A MILD EXPRESSION IN THEIR FINE EYES
4830-25904-0009 ONE LIONESS WAS ILL AND LAY ON HER BED LOOKING VERY PENSIVE WHILE HER MATE MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT HER EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND MUCH AFFLICTED BY HER SUFFERING
4830-25904-0010 I LIKED THIS LION VERY MUCH FOR THOUGH THE BIGGEST HE WAS VERY GENTLE AND HAD A NOBLE FACE THE TIGERS WERE RUSHING ABOUT AS TIGERS USUALLY ARE SOME CREEPING NOISELESSLY TO AND FRO
4830-25904-0011 SOME LEAPING UP AND DOWN AND SOME WASHING THEIR FACES WITH THEIR VELVET PAWS ALL LOOKED AND ACTED SO LIKE CATS THAT I WASN'T AT ALL SURPRISED TO HEAR ONE OF THEM PURR WHEN THE KEEPER SCRATCHED HER HEAD
4830-25904-0012 IT WAS A VERY LOUD AND LARGE PURR BUT NO FIRESIDE PUSSY COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER AND EVERY ONE LAUGHED AT THE SOUND THERE WERE PRETTY SPOTTED LEOPARDS PANTHERS AND SMALLER VARIETIES OF THE SAME SPECIES
4830-25904-0013 I SAT WATCHING THEM A LONG TIME LONGING TO LET SOME OF THE WILD THINGS OUT FOR A GOOD RUN THEY SEEMED SO UNHAPPY BARRED IN THOSE SMALL DENS SUDDENLY THE LIONS BEGAN TO ROAR THE TIGERS TO SNARL
4830-25904-0014 AND ALL TO GET VERY MUCH EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING SNIFFING AT THE OPENINGS THRUSTING THEIR PAWS THROUGH THE BARS AND LASHING THEIR TAILS IMPATIENTLY I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS TILL
4830-25904-0015 THIS WAS THEIR DINNER AND AS THEY WERE FED BUT ONCE A DAY THEY WERE RAVENOUS SUCH ROARS AND HOWLS AND CRIES AS AROSE WHILE THE MAN WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE LINE
4830-25904-0016 GAVE ONE A GOOD IDEA OF THE SOUNDS TO BE HEARD IN INDIAN FORESTS AND JUNGLES THE LIONS BEHAVED BEST FOR THEY ONLY PACED UP AND DOWN WITH AN OCCASIONAL CRY BUT THE TIGERS WERE QUITE FRANTIC
4830-25904-0017 FOR THEY TUMBLED ONE OVER THE OTHER SHOOK THE CAGES AND TRIED TO REACH THE BYSTANDERS
4830-25904-0018 ONE LADY HAD A FRIGHT FOR THE WIND BLEW THE END OF HER SHAWL WITHIN REACH OF A TIGER'S GREAT CLAW AND HE CLUTCHED IT TRYING TO DRAG HER NEARER THE SHAWL CAME OFF AND THE POOR LADY RAN AWAY SCREAMING
4830-25904-0019 AS IF A WHOLE FAMILY OF WILD BEASTS WERE AFTER HER
4830-25904-0020 THE TIGERS SNARLED AND FOUGHT AND TORE AND GOT SO SAVAGE I WAS VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY WERE SAFELY SHUT UP IN A FEW MINUTES NOTHING BUT WHITE BONES REMAINED AND THEN THEY HOWLED FOR MORE
4830-25904-0021 ONE LITTLE LEOPARD WAS BETTER BRED THAN THE OTHERS FOR HE WENT UP ON A SHELF IN THE CAGE AND ATE HIS DINNER IN A QUIET PROPER MANNER WHICH WAS AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST THE LIONS ATE IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE
4830-25904-0022 ALL BUT MY FAVOURITE WHO CARRIED HIS SHARE TO HIS SICK MATE AND BY EVERY GENTLE MEANS IN HIS POWER TRIED TO MAKE HER EAT SHE WAS TOO ILL HOWEVER AND TURNED AWAY WITH A PLAINTIVE MOAN WHICH SEEMED TO GRIEVE HIM SADLY
4830-25904-0023 HE WOULDN'T TOUCH HIS DINNER BUT LAY DOWN NEAR HER WITH THE LUMP BETWEEN HIS PAWS AS IF GUARDING IT FOR HER AND THERE I LEFT HIM PATIENTLY WAITING IN SPITE OF HIS HUNGER TILL HIS MATE COULD SHARE IT WITH HIM
4830-25904-0024 AS I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT HIS FINE OLD FACE I NAMED HIM DOUGLAS AND WALKED AWAY HUMMING TO MYSELF THE LINES OF THE BALLAD DOUGLAS DOUGLAS TENDER AND TRUE
4830-25904-0025 AS A CONTRAST TO THE WILD BEASTS I WENT TO SEE THE MONKEYS WHO LIVED IN A FINE LARGE HOUSE ALL TO THEMSELVES HERE WAS EVERY VARIETY FROM THE GREAT UGLY CHIMPANZEE TO THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOWS
4830-25904-0026 WHO PLAYED LIKE BOYS AND CUT UP ALL SORTS OF CAPERS A MAMMA SAT TENDING HER BABY AND LOOKING SO LIKE A LITTLE OLD WOMAN THAT I LAUGHED TILL THE GRAY MONKEY WITH THE BLUE NOSE SCOLDED AT ME
4830-25904-0027 HE WAS A CROSS OLD PARTY AND SAT HUDDLED UP IN THE STRAW SCOWLING AT EVERY ONE LIKE AN ILL TEMPERED OLD BACHELOR HALF A DOZEN LITTLE ONES TEASED HIM CAPITALLY BY DROPPING BITS OF BREAD
4830-25904-0028 NUT SHELLS AND STRAWS DOWN ON HIM FROM ABOVE AS THEY CLIMBED ABOUT THE PERCHES OR SWUNG BY THEIR TAILS ONE POOR LITTLE CHAP HAD LOST THE CURLY END OF HIS TAIL I'M AFRAID THE GRAY ONE BIT IT OFF
4830-25904-0029 AND KEPT TRYING TO SWING LIKE THE OTHERS FORGETTING THAT THE STRONG CURLY END WAS WHAT HE HELD ON WITH HE WOULD RUN UP THE BARE BOUGHS AND GIVE A JUMP EXPECTING TO CATCH AND SWING BUT THE LAME TAIL WOULDN'T HOLD HIM AND DOWN HE'D GO
4830-25904-0030 BOUNCE ON TO THE STRAW AT FIRST HE'D SIT AND STARE ABOUT HIM AS IF MUCH AMAZED TO FIND HIMSELF THERE THEN HE'D SCRATCH HIS LITTLE ROUND HEAD AND BEGIN TO SCOLD VIOLENTLY WHICH SEEMED TO DELIGHT THE OTHER MONKEYS
4830-25904-0031 AND FINALLY HE'D EXAMINE HIS POOR LITTLE TAIL AND APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM THE FUNNY EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS IRRESISTIBLE AND I ENJOYED SEEING HIM VERY MUCH
4830-25904-0032 AND GAVE HIM A BUN TO COMFORT HIM WHEN I WENT AWAY THE SNAKE HOUSE CAME NEXT AND I WENT IN ON MY WAY TO VISIT THE RHINOCEROS FAMILY I RATHER LIKE SNAKES
4830-25904-0033 SINCE I HAD A TAME GREEN ONE WHO LIVED UNDER THE DOOR STEP AND WOULD COME OUT AND PLAY WITH ME ON SUNNY DAYS THESE SNAKES I FOUND VERY INTERESTING ONLY THEY GOT UNDER THEIR BLANKETS AND WOULDN'T COME OUT AND I WASN'T ALLOWED TO POKE THEM
4830-25904-0034 AND BLINKED AT ME THROUGH THE GLASS LOOKING QUITE AS DANGEROUS AS HE WAS THERE WERE BIG AND LITTLE SNAKES BLACK BROWN AND SPECKLED LIVELY AND LAZY PRETTY AND PLAIN ONES BUT I LIKED THE GREAT BOA
4830-25904-0035 BEST WHEN I CAME TO HIS CAGE I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT THE BRANCH OF A TREE SUCH AS I HAD SEEN IN OTHER CAGES FOR THE SNAKES TO WIND UP AND DOWN WHERE IS HE I WONDER I HOPE HE HASN'T GOT
4830-25904-0036 OUT I SAID TO MYSELF THINKING OF A STORY I READ ONCE OF A PERSON IN A MENAGERIE WHO TURNED SUDDENLY AND SAW A GREAT BOA GLIDING TOWARDS HIM
4830-25904-0037 AS I STOOD WONDERING IF THE BIG WORM COULD BE UNDER THE LITTLE FLAT BLANKET BEFORE ME THE BRANCH BEGAN TO MOVE ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A START I SAW A LIMB SWING DOWN TO STARE AT ME WITH THE BOA'S GLITTERING EYES
4830-25904-0038 AND LAY SO STILL I HAD NOT SEEN HIM TILL HE CAME TO TAKE A LOOK AT ME A VERY VILLAINOUS LOOKING REPTILE HE WAS AND I FELT GRATEFUL THAT I DIDN'T LIVE IN A COUNTRY
4830-25904-0039 WHERE SUCH UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOURS MIGHT POP IN UPON YOU UNEXPECTEDLY HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE A PROMENADE AND SHOW ME HIS SIZE WHICH SEEMED IMMENSE AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF
4830-25904-0040 AND THEN KNOTTED HIS ROUGH GRAYISH BODY INTO A GREAT LOOP WITH THE FIERY EYED HEAD IN THE MIDDLE HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE LARGEST KIND BUT I WAS QUITE SATISFIED AND LEFT HIM TO HIS DINNER OF RABBITS
4830-25904-0041 WHICH I HADN'T THE HEART TO STAY AND SEE HIM DEVOUR ALIVE I WAS WALKING TOWARD THE CAMEL'S PAGODA WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A LONG DARK CURLING THING CAME OVER MY SHOULDER AND I FELT WARM BREATH IN MY FACE IT'S THE BOA I THOUGHT
4830-25904-0042 MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT OF SOME CHILDREN RIDING ON THE ELEPHANT WHOSE TRUNK HAD FRIGHTENED ME HE HAD POLITELY TRIED TO TELL ME TO CLEAR THE WAY WHICH I CERTAINLY HAD DONE WITH ALL SPEED PICKING MYSELF OUT OF THE HEDGE
4830-25904-0043 I WALKED BESIDE HIM EXAMINING HIS CLUMSY FEET AND PEERING UP AT HIS SMALL INTELLIGENT EYE I'M VERY SURE HE WINKED AT ME AS IF ENJOYING THE JOKE AND KEPT POKING HIS TRUNK INTO MY POCKET
4830-25904-0044 HOPING TO FIND SOMETHING EATABLE I FELT AS IF I HAD GOT INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY AS I LOOKED ABOUT ME AND SAW ELEPHANTS AND CAMELS WALKING AMONG THE TREES FLOCKS OF SNOW WHITE CRANES STALKING OVER THE GRASS
4830-25904-0045 ON THEIR LONG SCARLET LEGS STRIPED ZEBRAS RACING IN THEIR PADDOCK QUEER KANGAROOS HOPPING ABOUT WITH LITTLE ONES IN THEIR POUCHES PRETTY ANTELOPES CHASING ONE ANOTHER
4830-25904-0046 AND IN AN IMMENSE WIRE COVERED AVIARY ALL SORTS OF BRILLIANT BIRDS WERE FLYING ABOUT AS GAILY AS IF AT HOME ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES WAS A SEA COW WHO LIVED IN A TANK OF SALT WATER
4830-25904-0047 AND CAME AT THE KEEPER'S CALL TO KISS HIM AND FLOUNDER ON ITS FLIPPERS ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE TANK AFTER A FISH IT WAS VERY LIKE A SEAL ONLY MUCH LARGER AND HAD FOUR FINS INSTEAD OF TWO
4830-25904-0048 ITS EYES WERE LOVELY SO DARK AND SOFT AND LIQUID BUT ITS MOUTH WAS NOT PRETTY AND I DECLINED ONE OF THE DAMP KISSES WHICH IT WAS READY TO DISPENSE AT WORD OF COMMAND
4830-25904-0049 THE GREAT POLAR BEAR LIVED NEXT DOOR AND SPENT HIS TIME SPLASHING IN AND OUT OF A POOL OF WATER OR SITTING ON A BLOCK OF ICE PANTING AS IF THE MILD SPRING DAY WAS BLAZING MIDSUMMER
4830-25904-0050 HE LOOKED VERY UNHAPPY AND I THOUGHT IT A PITY THAT THEY DIDN'T INVENT A BIG REFRIGERATOR FOR HIM THESE ARE NOT HALF OF THE WONDERFUL CREATURES I SAW
7226-86965-0000 WE HAD BREAKFAST IN THE TAVERN KITCHEN
7226-86965-0001 WAS A SHORT SMOOTH FACED VOLUBLE OVERGROWN BOY SORT OF MAN THE MOTHER WAS DUMPY COARSE AND GOOD NATURED THEY HAD A GREASY EASY TEMPERED DAUGHTER OF EIGHTEEN WITH A FROWSY HEAD AND A FACE LIKE A FULL MOON
7226-86965-0002 WHILE THE HEIR OF THE HOUSEHOLD SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WAS A GAPING GRINNING YOUTH OF THE SIMPLE SIMON ORDER WHO SHOVELLED MASHED POTATOES INTO HIS MOUTH ALTERNATELY WITH KNIFE AND FORK AND TOOK BITES OF BREAD LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RAVENOUS DOG
7226-86965-0003 THE OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH A FACE LIKE PARCHMENT AND ONE GLEAMING EYE SAT IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR BY THE STOVE CROONING OVER A CORN COB PIPE AND USING THE WOOD BOX FOR A CUSPADORE SHE HAD A VINEGARY SLANGY TONGUE
7226-86965-0004 AND BEING SOMEWHAT DEAF WOULD BREAK IN UPON THE CONVERSATION WITH REMARKS SHARPER THAN THEY WERE PAT WITH OUR HOST A GLIB AND RAPID TALKER IN A SWAGGERING TONE ONE COULD NOT BUT BE MUCH AMUSED
7226-86965-0005 AS HE EXHIBITED A DEGREE OF SELF APPRECIATION THAT WAS DECIDEDLY REFRESHING HE HAD BEEN A VETERAN IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION HE PROUDLY ASSURED US AND POINTED WITH HIS KNIFE TO HIS DISCHARGE PAPER WHICH WAS HUNG UP IN AN OLD LOOKING GLASS FRAME
7226-86965-0006 BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS
7226-86965-0007 JOE MY BOY YOU GO NOW AN DO SOME'N FER YER COUNTRY A CRACK SHOT LIKE YOU IS JOE SAYS I TO MYSELF AS KIN HIT A DUCK ON THE WING EVERY TIME AN NO MISTAKE
7226-86965-0008 AN SO I JINED AN I STUCK HER OUT GEMMEN TILL THE THING WAS DONE THEY AIN'T NO COWARD BOUT ME
7226-86965-0009 NOW HE SAYS HOLD ON A MINUTE YOU DIDN'T HEV SHAKES AFORE THE WAR SAYS HE NOT AS MUCH I SAYS NOT KNOWIN WHAT THE FELLER WAS DRIVIN AT BUT SOME I WAS A KID THEN AND KIDS DON'T SHAKE MUCH SAYS I
7226-86965-0010 WELL GEMMEN SURE NOUGH WHEN I KEM TO THINK THINGS OVER AND TALK IT UP WITH THE DOCTOR CHAP I LOWED HE WAS RIGHT THEN HE LET ON HE WAS A CLAIM AGINT AN I LET HIM TRY HIS HAND ON WORKIN UP A PENSION FOR ME
7226-86965-0011 AN I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY SHOW IS BUT I OUGHT TO HEV A PENSION AN NO MISTAKE GEMMEN THEY WA'N'T NO FELLERS DID HARDER WORK N ME IN THE WAR EF I DO SAY IT MYSELF W VENTURED TO ASK WHAT BATTLES OUR HOST HAD BEEN IN
7226-86965-0012 WHAT I WANTED WAS TO GIT A BEAD ON OL WADE HIMSELF AN EF I DO SAY IT MYSELF THE OL MAN WOULD A HUNTED HIS HOLE GEMMEN WHEN I GET A SIGHT ON A DUCK GEMMEN THAT DUCK'S MINE AN NO MISTAKE
7226-86965-0013 AN EF I'D A SIGHTED WADE HAMPTIN THEN GOOD BY WADE I TOL THE CAP'N WHAT I WANTED BUT HE SAID AS HOW I WAS MORE USE A TAKIN KEER OF THE SUPPLIES THAT CAP'N HADN'T NO ENTERPRISE BOUT HIM
7226-86965-0014 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0015 I SAID TO OUR LANDLORD BY WAY OF HELPING ALONG THE CONVERSATION THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE BROKEN BY SIMPLE SIMON WHO WIPED HIS KNIFE ON HIS TONGUE AND MADE A WILD ATTACK ON THE BUTTER DISH PA HE DRUV A MULE TEAM FOR GOV'MENT
7226-86965-0016 WITH A BIG AMMERNITION WAGIN ON BEHIND
7226-86965-0017 THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE VETERAN'S CLAIM TO GLORY AND A PENSION PUT A DAMPER UPON HIS REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR AND GIVING THE INNOCENT SIMON A SAVAGE LEER
7226-86965-0018 HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
7226-86965-0019 IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE BREAKFAST WE WERE EATING WAS A SPECIAL SPREAD IN HONOR OF PROBABLY THE ONLY GUESTS THE QUONDAM TAVERN HAD HAD THESE MANY MONTHS CANOEISTS MUST NOT BE TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE FARE SET BEFORE THEM BUT ON THIS OCCASION
7226-86965-0020 WE WERE ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT A FEW MOUTHFULS OF THE REPAST AND OUR LUNCH BASKET WAS DRAWN ON AS SOON AS WE WERE ONCE MORE AFLOAT IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SO MANY FARMERS WIVES ARE THE WRETCHED COOKS THEY ARE
7226-86965-0021 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0022 SOUR DOUGHY BREAD POTATOES WHICH IF BOILED ARE BUT HALF COOKED AND IF MASHED ARE FLOATED WITH ABOMINABLE BUTTER OR PASTEY FLOUR GRAVY SALT PORK EITHER SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF GREASE OR FRIED TO A LEATHERY CHIP
7226-86965-0023 TEA AND COFFEE EXTREMELY WEAK OR STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL AN OX AS CHANCE MAY DICTATE AND INEVITABLY ADULTERATED BEYOND RECOGNITION
7226-86965-0024 EGGS THAT ARE SPOILED BY BEING FRIED TO THE CONSISTENCY OF RUBBER IN A PAN OF FAT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT DOUGHNUTS WHILE THE BISCUITS ARE YELLOW AND BITTER WITH SALERATUS THIS BILL OF FARE WARRANTED TO DESTROY THE BEST OF APPETITES
7226-86965-0025 WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY TOO MANY OF MY READERS AS THAT TO BE FOUND AT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FARM HOUSE ALTHOUGH WE ALL DOUBTLESS KNOW OF SOME MAGNIFICENT EXCEPTIONS WHICH ONLY PROVE THE RULE WE ESTABLISH PUBLIC COOKING SCHOOLS IN OUR CITIES
7226-86965-0026 AND ECONOMISTS LIKE EDWARD ATKINSON AND HYGIENISTS LIKE THE LATE DIO LEWIS ASSIDUOUSLY EXPLAIN TO THE METROPOLITAN POOR THEIR PROCESSES OF MAKING A TEMPTING MEAL OUT OF NOTHING
7226-86965-0027 BUT OUR MOST CRYING NEED IN THIS COUNTRY TO DAY IS A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR RURAL HOUSEWIVES WHERE THEY MAY BE TAUGHT TO EVOLVE A RESPECTABLE AND ECONOMICAL SPREAD OUT OF THE GREAT ABUNDANCE WITH WHICH THEY ARE SURROUNDED
7226-86965-0028 IT IS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY BOYS DRIFT TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY CAN OBTAIN PROPERLY COOKED FOOD AND LIVE LIKE RATIONAL BEINGS THE RIVER CONTINUES TO WIDEN AS WE APPROACH THE JUNCTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THIRTY NINE MILES BELOW ERIE
7226-86965-0029 AND TO ASSUME THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT RIVER INTO WHICH IT POURS ITS FLOOD THE ISLANDS INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN SIZE SOME OF THEM BEING OVER A MILE IN LENGTH BY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN BREADTH
7226-86965-0030 THE BOTTOMS FREQUENTLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO WIDE MORASSES THICKLY STUDDED WITH GREAT ELMS MAPLES AND COTTON WOODS AMONG WHICH THE SPRING FLOOD HAS WROUGHT DIREFUL DESTRUCTION THE SCENE BECOMES PECULIARLY DESOLATE
7226-86965-0031 AND MOURNFUL OFTEN GIVING ONE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING FAR REMOVED FROM CIVILIZATION THREADING THE COURSE OF SOME HITHERTO UNEXPLORED STREAM PENETRATE THE DEEP FRINGE OF FOREST AND MORASS ON FOOT HOWEVER AND SMILING PRAIRIES ARE FOUND BEYOND
7226-86965-0032 OF BEING EITHER GROUNDED OR CAPSIZED NOW AND THEN THE BANKS BECOME FIRMER WITH CHARMING VISTAS OF HIGH WOODED HILLS COMING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BROAD SAVANNAS INTERVENE DECKED OUT WITH VARIEGATED FLORA
7226-86965-0033 THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
7226-86965-0034 AND THERE ARE EVIDENCES THAT THE STREAM HAS OCCASIONALLY CHANGED ITS COURSE THROUGH THE SUNBAKED BANKS OF ASHY GRAY MUD IN YEARS LONG PAST AT CLEVELAND A STAID LITTLE VILLAGE ON AN OPEN PLAIN WHICH WE REACHED SOON AFTER THE DINNER HOUR
7226-86965-0035 THERE IS AN UNUSED MILL DAM GOING TO DECAY IN THE CENTRE THE MAIN CURRENT HAS WASHED OUT A BREADTH OF THREE OR FOUR RODS THROUGH WHICH THE PENT UP STREAM RUSHES WITH A ROAR AND A HUNDRED WHIRLPOOLS IT IS AN UGLY CREVASSE
7226-86965-0036 BUT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION SHOWED THE PASSAGE TO BE FEASIBLE SO WE RETREATED AN EIGHTH OF A MILE UP STREAM TOOK OUR BEARINGS AND WENT THROUGH WITH A SPEED THAT NEARLY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY AND APPEARED TO GREATLY ASTONISH A HALF DOZEN FISHERMEN
7226-86965-0037 IDLY ANGLING FROM THE DILAPIDATED APRON ON EITHER SIDE IT WAS LIKE GOING THROUGH CLEVELAND ON THE FAST MAIL FOURTEEN MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK IS THE CHICAGO BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD BRIDGE WITH CARBON CLIFF ON THE NORTH
7226-86965-0038 AND COLOMA ON THE SOUTH EACH ONE MILE FROM THE RIVER THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK WITH OCCASIONAL SLIGHT SHOWERS AND A STIFF HEAD WIND SO THAT PROGRESS HAD BEEN SLOW WE BEGAN TO DEEM IT WORTH WHILE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE MOUTH
7226-86965-0039 STOPPING TO QUESTION THEM WE FOUND THEM BOTH WELL INFORMED AS TO THE RAILWAY TIME TABLES OF THE VICINITY AND THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER RIVER THEY TOLD US THAT THE SCENERY FOR THE NEXT FOURTEEN MILES WAS SIMILAR IN ITS DARK DESOLATION TO THAT WHICH WE HAD PASSED THROUGH DURING THE DAY
7226-86965-0040 ALSO THAT OWING TO THE GREAT NUMBER OF ISLANDS AND THE LABYRINTH OF CHANNELS BOTH IN THE ROCK AND ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI WE SHOULD FIND IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE LATTER WE SHOULD DOUBTLESS PROCEED SEVERAL MILES BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0041 BEFORE WE NOTICED THAT THE CURRENT WAS SETTING PERSISTENTLY SOUTH AND THEN WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN RETRACING OUR COURSE AND PULLING UP STREAM TO OUR DESTINATION ROCK ISLAND WHICH IS SIX MILES NORTH OF THE DELTA OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7226-86965-0043 AND MILAN WAS FARTHER FROM ROCK ISLAND THAN EITHER CARBON CLIFF OR COLOMA WITH LESS FREQUENT RAILWAY SERVICE FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THIS ADVICE AND TO SHIP FROM COLOMA
7226-86965-0044 TAKING A FINAL SPURT DOWN TO A FERRY LANDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEYOND ON THE SOUTH BANK
7226-86965-0045 HAVING VOYAGED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILES IN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AND A HALF LEAVING W TO GOSSIP WITH THE FERRYMAN'S WIFE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE BANK WITH AN ARMFUL OF SMILING TWINS TO VIEW A CRAFT SO STRANGE TO HER VISION
7226-86965-0046 I WENT UP INTO THE COUNTRY TO ENGAGE A TEAM TO TAKE OUR BOAT UPON ITS LAST PORTAGE AFTER HAVING BEEN GRUFFLY REFUSED BY A CHURLISH FARMER WHO DOUBTLESS RECOGNIZED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CANOEIST AND A TRAMP
7226-86965-0047 I STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH A NEGRO CULTIVATING A CORNFIELD WITH A SPAN OF COAL BLACK MULES AND IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS AT THE FERRY LANDING WITH A WAGON WASHING OUT THE CANOE AND CHAINING IN THE OARS AND PADDLE WE LIFTED IT INTO THE WAGON BOX
7226-86965-0048 PILED OUR BAGGAGE ON TOP AND SET OFF OVER THE HILLS AND FIELDS TO COLOMA
7226-86965-0049 ANKLE DEEP IN MUD FOR THE LATE RAINS HAD WELL MOISTENED THE BLACK PRAIRIE SOIL IT WAS A UNIQUE AND PICTURESQUE PROCESSION
2436-2481-0000 DOCTOR FRANK'S FACE HAD GONE WHITE SNAP STOOD LIKE A STATUE OF HORROR THE DECK HERE WAS PATCHED AS ALWAYS WITH SILVER RADIANCE FROM THE DECK PORTS THE EMPTY DECK CHAIRS STOOD ABOUT THE SCREAM

911-130578-0008 AND IN TRUTH HER CHEEKS WERE BADLY SWOLLEN THEN HE TOLD HER THAT A GOOD CURE FOR TOOTHACHE WAS TO BITE ON A WHITE STONE AND SHE BELIEVED HIM AND THE NEXT MORNING GOT A PIECE OF WHITE QUARTZ AND BEGAN TO BITE ON IT
911-130578-0009 BUT THIS ONLY BROKE HER TEETH AND MADE HER MOUTH BLEED SO THAT THE PAIN WAS WORSE THAN BEFORE THEN THE BOY JEERED AT HER AND SAID DID YOU THINK GRANNIE THAT YOU COULD BITE MY IRON BOW AND ARROWS SO SAYING HE LEFT HER
911-130578-0010 AND CONTINUED THE SEARCH FOR HIS FATHER
911-130578-0011 HE CAME TO A LAKE AND HE SAT DOWN BY IT TO EAT WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE PROVISIONS HE HAD BROUGHT AS HE SAT HE SUDDENLY SAW SOME COW BISON COMING DOWN TO THE LAKE AT THIS HE CAUGHT UP HIS BOW AND ARROWS IN A HURRY
911-130578-0012 AND CLIMBED UP A TALL SAL TREE FROM THE TREE HE WATCHED THE BISON GO DOWN TO THE WATER TO DRINK AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE JUNGLE AND AFTER THEM TIGERS AND BEARS CAME DOWN TO THE WATER
911-130578-0013 THE SIGHT OF THEM FRIGHTENED HIM AND HE SANG DRINK YOUR FILL TIGER I SHALL NOT SHOOT YOU
911-130578-0014 AND THEY DRANK AND WENT AWAY THEN VARIOUS KINDS OF BIRDS CAME
911-130578-0015 AND AMONG THEM WAS ONE WHICH HAD THE DRIED UP BODY OF THE BOY'S FATHER STUCK ON ITS HORN THE BOY WAS RATHER FRIGHTENED AND SANG
911-130578-0016 HE PUT AN ARROW THROUGH IT AND IT TURNED A SOMERSAULT AND FELL OVER DEAD
911-130578-0017 AND RAN AWAY THEN THE BOY CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE TREE AND PULLED THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FATHER OFF THE HORN OF THE DEAD ANIMAL AND LAID IT DOWN AT THE FOOT OF A TREE AND BEGAN TO WEEP OVER IT AS HE WEPT
911-130578-0018 A MAN SUDDENLY STOOD BEFORE HIM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WHEN HE HEARD SAID CRY NO MORE TAKE A CLOTH AND WET IT IN THE LAKE AND COVER YOUR FATHER'S BODY WITH IT
911-130578-0019 AND THEN WHIP THE BODY WITH A MERAL TWIG AND HE WILL COME TO LIFE SO SAYING THE STRANGER SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND THE BOY OBEYED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND BEHOLD HIS FATHER SAT UP ALIVE AND RUBBING HIS EYES SAID
911-130578-0020 I MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP A VERY LONG TIME THEN HIS SON EXPLAINED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND GAVE HIM SOME FOOD
5163-39921-0000 WHY MISTER CROPPER CHANGED HIS MIND WELL MISS MAXWELL HOW DID YOU GET ALONG TODAY ASKED MISTER BAXTER AFFABLY WHEN THE NEW TEACHER CAME TO THE TABLE SHE WAS A SLIGHT DARK GIRL RATHER PLAIN LOOKING
5163-39921-0001 BUT WITH A SMART ENERGETIC WAY MISTER BAXTER APPROVED OF HER HE LIKED HER STYLE AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID THE SUMMER TERM HAD JUST OPENED IN THE MAITLAND DISTRICT ESTHER MAXWELL WAS A STRANGER
5163-39921-0002 BUT SHE WAS A CAPABLE GIRL AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HER OWN ABILITY TO GET AND KEEP THE SCHOOL IN GOOD WORKING ORDER SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY AT MISTER BAXTER VERY WELL FOR A BEGINNING THE CHILDREN SEEM BRIGHT AND TEACHABLE
5163-39921-0003 AND NOT HARD TO CONTROL MISTER BAXTER NODDED THERE ARE NO BAD CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL EXCEPT THE CROPPER BOYS AND THEY CAN BE GOOD ENOUGH IF THEY LIKE RECKON THEY WEREN'T THERE TODAY NO
5163-39921-0004 WELL MISS MAXWELL I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THOSE BOYS WHEN THEY DO COME FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED YOU KNOW MISTER CROPPER WAS OPPOSED TO OUR HIRING YOU
5163-39921-0005 NOT OF COURSE THAT HE HAD ANY PERSONAL OBJECTION TO YOU BUT HE IS SET AGAINST FEMALE TEACHERS AND WHEN A CROPPER IS SET THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH CAN CHANGE HIM HE SAYS FEMALE TEACHERS CAN'T KEEP ORDER
5163-39921-0006 THEY KNOW HE'LL BACK THEM UP IN SECRET NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO JUST TO PROVE HIS OPINIONS CROPPER IS SLY AND SLIPPERY AND IT IS HARD TO CORNER HIM ARE THE BOYS BIG QUERIED ESTHER ANXIOUSLY
5163-39921-0007 YES THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN AND BIG FOR THEIR AGE YOU CAN'T WHIP EM THAT IS THE TROUBLE A MAN MIGHT BUT THEY'D TWIST YOU AROUND THEIR FINGERS YOU'LL HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL I'M AFRAID
5163-39921-0008 BUT MAYBE THEY'LL BEHAVE ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL MISTER BAXTER PRIVATELY HAD NO HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BUT ESTHER HOPED FOR THE BEST SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT MISTER CROPPER WOULD CARRY HIS PREJUDICES INTO A PERSONAL APPLICATION
5163-39921-0009 THIS CONVICTION WAS STRENGTHENED WHEN HE OVERTOOK HER WALKING FROM SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY AND DROVE HER HOME HE WAS A BIG HANDSOME MAN WITH A VERY SUAVE POLITE MANNER HE ASKED INTERESTEDLY ABOUT HER SCHOOL AND HER WORK
5163-39921-0010 HOPED SHE WAS GETTING ON WELL AND SAID HE HAD TWO YOUNG RASCALS OF HIS OWN TO SEND SOON ESTHER FELT RELIEVED SHE THOUGHT THAT MISTER BAXTER HAD EXAGGERATED MATTERS A LITTLE THAT PLUM TREE OF MISSUS CHARLEY'S IS LOADED WITH FRUIT AGAIN THIS YEAR
5163-39921-0011 REMARKED MISTER BAXTER AT THE TEA TABLE THAT EVENING I CAME PAST IT TODAY ON MY WAY CROSS LOTS HOME FROM THE WOODS THERE WILL BE BUSHELS OF PLUMS ON IT
5163-39921-0012 I DON'T SUPPOSE POOR MISSUS CHARLEY WILL GET ONE OF THEM ANY MORE THAN SHE EVER HAS SAID MISSUS BAXTER INDIGNANTLY IT'S A BURNING SHAME THAT'S WHAT IT IS I JUST WISH SHE COULD CATCH THE CROPPERS ONCE
5163-39921-0013 YOU HAVEN'T ANY PROOF THAT IT IS REALLY THEM MARY OBJECTED HER HUSBAND AND YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE RECKLESS ACCUSATIONS BEFORE FOLKS I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS THEM
5163-39921-0014 AND MISSUS CHARLEY KNOWS IT TOO ALTHOUGH SHE CAN'T PROVE IT MORE'S THE PITY I DON'T SAY ISAAC CROPPER STEALS THOSE PLUMS WITH HIS OWN HANDS BUT HE KNOWS WHO DOES AND THE PLUMS GO INTO MEHITABLE CROPPER'S PRESERVING KETTLE
5163-39921-0015 THERE'S NOTHING SURER YOU SEE MISS MAXWELL IT'S THIS WAY EXPLAINED MISTER BAXTER TURNING TO ESTHER MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HUSBAND WAS ISAAC'S BROTHER
5163-39921-0016 THEY NEVER GOT ON WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN CHARLEY DIED THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS FUSS ABOUT THE PROPERTY ISAAC ACTED MEAN AND SCANDALOUS CLEAR THROUGH AND PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN DOWN ON HIM EVER SINCE
5163-39921-0017 BUT MISSUS CHARLEY IS A PRETTY SMART WOMAN AND HE DIDN'T GET THE BETTER OF HER IN EVERYTHING THERE WAS A STRIP OF DISPUTED LAND BETWEEN THE TWO FARMS AND SHE SECURED IT THERE'S A BIG PLUM TREE GROWING ON IT CLOSE TO THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0018 IT'S THE FINEST ONE IN MAITLAND BUT MISSUS CHARLEY NEVER GETS A PLUM FROM IT
5163-39921-0019 ASKED ESTHER THEY DISAPPEAR SAID MISTER BAXTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT NOD WHEN THE PLUMS ARE ANYTHING LIKE RIPE MISSUS CHARLEY DISCOVERS SOME DAY THAT THERE ISN'T ONE LEFT ON THE TREE
5163-39921-0020 SHE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET A SCRAP OF PROOF AS TO WHO TOOK THEM OR SHE'D MAKE IT HOT FOR THEM BUT NOBODY IN MAITLAND HAS ANY DOUBT IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ISAAC CROPPER KNOWS WHERE THOSE PLUMS GO
5163-39921-0021 I DON'T THINK MISTER CROPPER WOULD STEAL PROTESTED ESTHER WELL HE DOESN'T CONSIDER IT STEALING YOU KNOW HE CLAIMS THE LAND AND SAYS THE PLUMS ARE HIS
5163-39921-0022 I DON'T DOUBT THAT HE IS QUITE CLEAR IN HIS OWN MIND THAT THEY ARE AND HE DOES HATE MISSUS CHARLEY I'D GIVE CONSIDERABLE TO SEE THE OLD SINNER FAIRLY CAUGHT BUT HE IS TOO DEEP
5163-39921-0023 I THINK MISTER BAXTER IS TOO HARD ON MISTER CROPPER SAID ESTHER TO HERSELF LATER ON HE HAS PROBABLY SOME PRIVATE PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM BUT A MONTH LATER SHE HAD CHANGED HER OPINION
5163-39921-0024 DURING THAT TIME THE CROPPER BOYS HAD COME TO SCHOOL AT FIRST ESTHER HAD BEEN INCLINED TO LIKE THEM THEY WERE HANDSOME LADS WITH THE SAME SMOOTH WAY THAT CHARACTERIZED THEIR FATHER AND SEEMED BRIGHT AND INTELLIGENT
5163-39921-0025 FOR A FEW DAYS ALL WENT WELL AND ESTHER FELT DECIDEDLY RELIEVED BUT BEFORE LONG A SUBTLE SPIRIT OF INSUBORDINATION BEGAN TO MAKE ITSELF FELT IN THE SCHOOL ESTHER FOUND HERSELF POWERLESS TO COPE WITH IT
5163-39921-0026 THE CROPPERS NEVER OPENLY DEFIED HER BUT THEY DID PRECISELY AS THEY PLEASED THE OTHER PUPILS THOUGHT THEMSELVES AT LIBERTY TO FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME POOR ESTHER HAD COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF HER LITTLE KINGDOM
5163-39921-0027 SOME COMPLAINTS WERE HEARD AMONG THE RATEPAYERS AND EVEN MISTER BAXTER LOOKED DUBIOUS SHE KNEW THAT UNLESS SHE COULD REGAIN HER AUTHORITY SHE WOULD BE REQUESTED TO HAND IN HER RESIGNATION
5163-39921-0028 BUT SHE WAS BAFFLED BY THE ELUSIVE SYSTEM OF DEFIANCE WHICH THE CROPPER BOYS HAD ORGANIZED ONE DAY SHE RESOLVED TO GO TO MISTER CROPPER HIMSELF AND APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE IF HE HAD ANY
5163-39921-0029 IT HAD BEEN AN ESPECIALLY HARD DAY IN SCHOOL WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT AT THE NOON HOUR ALL THE DESKS IN THE SCHOOLROOM HAD BEEN PILED IN A PYRAMID ON THE FLOOR BOOKS AND SLATES INTERCHANGED AND VARIOUS OTHER PRANKS PLAYED
5163-39921-0030 WHEN QUESTIONED EVERY PUPIL DENIED HAVING DONE OR HELPED TO DO IT ALFRED AND BOB CROPPER LOOKED HER SQUARELY IN THE EYES AND DECLARED THEIR INNOCENCE IN THEIR USUAL GENTLEMANLY FASHION YET ESTHER FELT SURE THAT THEY WERE THE GUILTY ONES
5163-39921-0031 SHE ALSO KNEW WHAT EXAGGERATED ACCOUNTS OF THE AFFAIR WOULD BE TAKEN HOME TO MAITLAND TEA TABLES AND SHE FELT LIKE SITTING DOWN TO CRY BUT SHE DID NOT INSTEAD SHE SET HER MOUTH FIRMLY HELPED THE CHILDREN RESTORE THE ROOM TO ORDER
5163-39921-0032 AND AFTER SCHOOL WENT UP TO ISAAC CROPPER'S HOUSE THAT GENTLEMAN HIMSELF CAME IN FROM THE HARVEST FIELD LOOKING AS COURTLY AS USUAL EVEN IN HIS ROUGH WORKING CLOTHES HE SHOOK HANDS HEARTILY TOLD HER HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER

5163-39921-0039 WHEN I SEND MY BOYS TO SCHOOL I NATURALLY EXPECT THAT THE TEACHER WILL BE CAPABLE OF DOING THE WORK SHE HAS BEEN HIRED TO DO THEN YOU REFUSE TO HELP ME SAID ESTHER IN A TREMBLING VOICE
5163-39921-0040 WHY MY DEAR YOUNG LADY WHAT CAN I DO BOYS SOON KNOW WHEN THEY CAN DISOBEY A TEACHER WITH IMPUNITY NO DOUBT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE A SCHOOL EASIER TO CONTROL AND WILL DO GOOD WORK

5163-39921-0042 SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST GET AWAY AT ONCE OR SHE WOULD BURST INTO HEARTSICK TEARS UNDER THOSE STEELY BLAND BLUE EYES WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER ROOM AND CRIED THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HER TO DO BUT RESIGN SHE THOUGHT DISMALLY
5163-39921-0043 ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY ESTHER WENT FOR AN AFTERNOON WALK CARRYING HER KODAK WITH HER IT WAS A BRILLIANTLY FINE AUTUMN DAY AND WOODS AND FIELDS WERE BASKING IN A MELLOW HAZE ESTHER WENT ACROSS LOTS TO MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HOUSE INTENDING TO MAKE A CALL
5163-39921-0044 BUT THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP AND EVIDENTLY DESERTED SO SHE RAMBLED PAST IT TO THE BACK FIELDS PASSING THROUGH A GROVE OF MAPLES SHE CAME OUT AMONG LEAFY YOUNG SAPLINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST BEYOND HER WITH ITS LADEN BOUGHS HANGING OVER THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0045 WAS THE FAMOUS PLUM TREE ESTHER LOOKED AT IT FOR A MOMENT THEN AN ODD SMILE GLEAMED OVER HER FACE AND SHE LIFTED HER KODAK MONDAY EVENING ESTHER CALLED ON MISTER CROPPER AGAIN
5163-39921-0046 AFTER THE PRELIMINARY REMARKS IN WHICH HE INDULGED SHE SAID WITH SEEMING IRRELEVANCE THAT SATURDAY HAD BEEN A FINE DAY THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT LIGHT FOR SNAPSHOTS SHE WENT ON COOLLY
5163-39921-0047 I HAVE BROUGHT YOU UP A PROOF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT SHE ROSE AND PLACED THE PROOF ON THE TABLE BEFORE MISTER CROPPER THE PLUM TREE CAME OUT CLEARLY
5163-39921-0048 BOB AND ALF CROPPER WERE UP AMONG THE BOUGHS PICKING THE PLUMS ON THE GROUND BENEATH THEM STOOD THEIR FATHER WITH A BASKET OF FRUIT IN HIS HAND MISTER CROPPER LOOKED AT THE PROOF AND FROM IT TO ESTHER
5163-39921-0049 HIS EYES HAD LOST THEIR UNCONCERNED GLITTER BUT HIS VOICE WAS DEFIANT THE PLUMS ARE MINE BY RIGHT HE SAID PERHAPS SAID ESTHER CALMLY BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO DO NOT THINK SO
5163-39921-0050 MISSUS CHARLEY FOR INSTANCE SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROOF I THINK DON'T SHOW IT TO HER CRIED MISTER CROPPER HASTILY I TELL YOU MISS MAXWELL THE PLUMS ARE MINE BUT I AM TIRED OF FIGHTING OVER THEM
5163-39921-0051 AND I HAD DECIDED BEFORE THIS THAT I'D LET HER HAVE THEM AFTER THIS IT'S ONLY A TRIFLE ANYHOW AND ABOUT THAT LITTLE MATTER WE WERE DISCUSSING THE OTHER NIGHT MISS MAXWELL I HAVE BEEN THINKING IT OVER AND
5163-39921-0052 I ADMIT I WAS SOMEWHAT UNREASONABLE I'LL TALK TO ALFRED AND ROBERT AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO VERY WELL SAID ESTHER QUIETLY THE MATTER OF THE PLUMS ISN'T MY BUSINESS
5163-39921-0053 AND I DON'T WISH TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR FAMILY FEUDS ESPECIALLY AS YOU SAY THAT YOU MEAN TO ALLOW MISSUS CHARLEY TO ENJOY HER OWN IN FUTURE AS FOR THE SCHOOL WE WILL HOPE THAT MATTERS WILL IMPROVE
5163-39921-0054 YOU'LL LEAVE THE PROOF WITH ME WON'T YOU SAID MISTER CROPPER EAGERLY OH CERTAINLY SAID ESTHER SMILING I HAVE THE NEGATIVE STILL YOU KNOW FROM THAT TIME OUT THE CROPPER BOYS WERE MODELS OF GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND THE OTHER TURBULENT SPIRITS
5163-39921-0055 HAVING LOST THEIR LEADERS WERE SOON QUELLED COMPLAINT DIED AWAY AND AT THE END OF THE TERM ESTHER WAS RE ENGAGED YOU SEEM TO HAVE WON OLD CROPPER OVER TO YOUR SIDE ENTIRELY MISTER BAXTER TOLD HER THAT NIGHT
5163-39921-0056 I NEVER KNEW ISAAC CROPPER TO CHANGE HIS OPINIONS SO HANDSOMELY ESTHER SMILED
3374-298032-0000 THE CHILDREN ARE JUSTIFIED WHEN THEY PEEP SO CURIOUSLY AND TIMIDLY AT A COMPANY OF UNKNOWN FACES EACH INDIVIDUAL ATOM OF EVERLASTING TIME IS CAPABLE OF COMPRISING A WORLD OF JOY
3374-298032-0001 AND AT THE SAME TIME OF OPENING UP A FATHOMLESS ABYSS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING
3374-298032-0002 I UNDERSTAND NOW THE OLD FAIRY TALE ABOUT THE MAN WHOM THE SORCERER ALLOWED TO LIVE A GREAT MANY YEARS IN A FEW MOMENTS FOR I KNOW BY MY OWN EXPERIENCE THE TERRIBLE OMNIPOTENCE OF THE FANTASY
3374-298032-0003 SINCE THE LAST LETTER FROM YOUR SISTER IT IS THREE DAYS NOW I HAVE UNDERGONE THE SUFFERINGS OF AN ENTIRE LIFE FROM THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OF GLOWING YOUTH TO THE PALE MOONLIGHT OF SAGACIOUS OLD AGE
3374-298032-0004 EVERY LITTLE DETAIL SHE WROTE ABOUT YOUR SICKNESS TAKEN WITH WHAT I HAD ALREADY GLEANED FROM THE DOCTOR AND HAD OBSERVED MYSELF CONFIRMED MY SUSPICION THAT IT WAS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN YOU THOUGHT
3374-298032-0005 INDEED NO LONGER DANGEROUS BUT DECIDED PAST HOPE LOST IN THIS THOUGHT AND MY STRENGTH ENTIRELY EXHAUSTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HURRYING TO YOUR SIDE
3374-298032-0006 MY STATE OF MIND WAS REALLY VERY DISCONSOLATE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY WAS BEING NEW BORN BY THE JOYFUL NEWS THAT YOU ARE WELL AGAIN
3374-298032-0007 I DID NOT THINK OF IT AS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OR EVEN IN THE PRESENT EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY PAST FOR A LONG TIME YOU HAD BEEN WRAPT IN THE BOSOM OF THE COLD EARTH
3374-298032-0008 FLOWERS HAD STARTED TO GROW ON THE BELOVED GRAVE AND MY TEARS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FLOW MORE GENTLY MUTE AND ALONE I STOOD AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE FEATURES I HAD LOVED AND THE SWEET GLANCES OF THE EXPRESSIVE EYES
3374-298032-0009 NOW AND THEN THE PALE FACE SMILED AND SEEMED ASLEEP JUST AS IT HAD LOOKED THE LAST TIME I SAW IT THEN OF A SUDDEN THE DIFFERENT MEMORIES ALL BECAME CONFUSED
3374-298032-0010 WITH UNBELIEVABLE RAPIDITY THE OUTLINES CHANGED REASSUMED THEIR FIRST FORM AND TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THE WILD VISION VANISHED
3374-298032-0011 ONLY YOUR HOLY EYES REMAINED IN THE EMPTY SPACE AND HUNG THERE MOTIONLESS EVEN AS THE FRIENDLY STARS SHINE ETERNALLY OVER OUR POVERTY
3374-298032-0012 NOW A PIERCING PAIN FROM DARK SUNS BURNED ME WITH AN INSUPPORTABLE GLARE NOW A BEAUTIFUL RADIANCE HOVERED ABOUT AS IF TO ENTICE ME THEN I SEEMED TO FEEL A FRESH BREATH OF MORNING AIR FAN ME
3374-298032-0013 I HELD MY HEAD UP AND CRIED ALOUD
3374-298032-0014 WHY SHOULD YOU TORMENT YOURSELF IN A FEW MINUTES YOU CAN BE WITH HER
3374-298032-0015 I WAS ALREADY HASTENING TO YOU WHEN SUDDENLY A NEW THOUGHT HELD ME BACK AND I SAID TO MY SPIRIT
3374-298032-0016 UNWORTHY MAN YOU CANNOT EVEN ENDURE THE TRIFLING DISSONANCES OF THIS ORDINARY LIFE AND YET YOU REGARD YOURSELF AS READY FOR AND WORTHY OF A HIGHER LIFE GO AWAY AND DO AND SUFFER AS YOUR CALLING IS
3374-298032-0017 AND THEN PRESENT YOURSELF AGAIN WHEN YOUR ORDERS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
3374-298032-0018 IS IT NOT TO YOU ALSO REMARKABLE HOW EVERYTHING ON THIS EARTH MOVES TOWARD THE CENTRE HOW ORDERLY EVERYTHING IS HOW INSIGNIFICANT AND TRIVIAL SO IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME
3374-298032-0019 AND FOR THAT REASON I SUSPECT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I HAVE ALREADY IMPARTED MY SUSPICION TO YOU THAT THE NEXT LIFE WILL BE LARGER AND IN THE GOOD AS WELL AS IN THE BAD STRONGER WILDER BOLDER AND MORE TREMENDOUS
3374-298032-0020 AS WHEN A PERSON SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE MIDST OF IMMEASURABLE MOUNTAINS OF ICE EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND IN ME WAS COLD AND STRANGE AND EVEN MY TEARS FROZE
3374-298032-0021 WONDERFUL WORLDS APPEARED AND VANISHED BEFORE ME IN MY UNEASY DREAM I WAS SICK AND SUFFERED GREAT PAIN BUT I LOVED MY SICKNESS AND WELCOMED THE SUFFERING
3374-298032-0022 I HATED EVERYTHING EARTHLY AND WAS GLAD TO SEE IT ALL PUNISHED AND DESTROYED I FELT SO ALONE AND SO STRANGELY
3374-298032-0023 AND AS A DELICATE SPIRIT OFTEN GROWS MELANCHOLY IN THE VERY LAP OF HAPPINESS OVER ITS OWN JOY AND AT THE VERY ACME OF ITS EXISTENCE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF THE FUTILITY OF IT ALL
3374-298032-0024 SO DID I REGARD MY SUFFERING WITH MYSTERIOUS PLEASURE I REGARDED IT AS THE SYMBOL OF LIFE IN GENERAL I BELIEVED THAT I WAS SEEING AND FEELING THE EVERLASTING DISCORD
3374-298032-0025 AND THE LOVELY FORMS OF REFINED CULTURE SEEMED DEAD AND TRIVIAL TO ME IN COMPARISON WITH THIS MONSTROUS WORLD OF INFINITE STRENGTH AND OF UNENDING STRUGGLE AND WARFARE
3374-298032-0026 EVEN INTO THE MOST HIDDEN DEPTHS OF EXISTENCE ON ACCOUNT OF THIS REMARKABLE FEELING SICKNESS ACQUIRED THE CHARACTER OF A PECULIAR WORLD COMPLETE IN ITSELF
3374-298032-0027 I FELT THAT ITS MYSTERIOUS LIFE WAS RICHER AND DEEPER THAN THE VULGAR HEALTH OF THE DREAMING SLEEP WALKERS ALL AROUND ME AND WITH THE SICKLINESS WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL UNPLEASANT
3374-298032-0028 THIS FEELING ALSO CLUNG TO ME AND COMPLETELY SEPARATED ME FROM OTHER MEN JUST AS I WAS SUNDERED FROM THE EARTH BY THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR NATURE AND MY LOVE HAD BEEN TOO SACRED
3374-298032-0029 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ALL WAS RIGHT SO AND THAT YOUR UNAVOIDABLE DEATH WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A GENTLE AWAKENING AFTER A LIGHT SLEEP I TOO THOUGHT THAT I WAS AWAKE WHEN I SAW YOUR PICTURE
3374-298032-0030 WHICH EVERMORE TRANSFIGURED ITSELF INTO A CHEERFUL DIFFUSED PURITY SERIOUS AND YET CHARMING QUITE YOU AND YET NO LONGER YOU THE DIVINE FORM IRRADIATED BY A WONDERFUL LIGHT
3374-298032-0031 NOW IT WAS LIKE THE TERRIBLE GLEAM OF VISIBLE OMNIPOTENCE NOW LIKE A SOFT RAY OF GOLDEN CHILDHOOD
3374-298032-0032 BECAUSE EVERY EARTHLY SENTIMENT WAS ENTIRELY STRANGE TO ME AND THE FEELING NEVER LEFT ME THAT I WAS CONSECRATED TO DEATH
3374-298032-0033 THE YEARS PASSED SLOWLY BY AND DEEDS AND WORKS ADVANCED LABORIOUSLY TO THEIR GOAL ONE AFTER THE OTHER A GOAL THAT SEEMED AS LITTLE MINE AS THE DEEDS AND WORKS SEEMED TO BE WHAT THEY ARE CALLED
3374-298032-0034 TO ME THEY WERE MERELY HOLY SYMBOLS AND EVERYTHING BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY ONE BELOVED
3374-298032-0035 AND THE ONE ETERNAL AND INDIVISIBLE HUMANITY ALL EXISTENCE WAS AN UNINTERRUPTED DIVINE SERVICE OF SOLITARY LOVE
3374-298032-0036 FINALLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS NOW NEARLY OVER THE BROW WAS NO LONGER SMOOTH AND THE LOCKS WERE BECOMING GRAY MY CAREER WAS ENDED BUT NOT COMPLETED
3374-298032-0037 THE BEST STRENGTH OF LIFE WAS GONE AND STILL ART AND VIRTUE
3374-298032-0038 STOOD EVER UNATTAINABLE BEFORE ME I SHOULD HAVE DESPAIRED HAD I NOT PERCEIVED AND IDOLIZED BOTH IN YOU GRACIOUS MADONNA AND YOU AND YOUR GENTLE GODLINESS IN MYSELF
3374-298032-0039 THEN YOU APPEARED TO ME BECKONING WITH THE SUMMONS OF DEATH
3374-298032-0040 AN EARNEST LONGING FOR YOU AND FOR FREEDOM SEIZED ME I YEARNED FOR MY DEAR OLD FATHERLAND AND WAS ABOUT TO SHAKE OFF THE DUST OF TRAVEL WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY CALLED BACK TO LIFE BY THE PROMISE AND REASSURANCE OF YOUR RECOVERY
3374-298032-0041 AND ONLY IN THAT WAY DOES A HUMAN BEING BECOME ONE AND A COMPLETE ENTITY THAT IS BY REGARDING AND POETICALLY CONCEIVING HIMSELF AS THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING AND THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD
3374-298032-0042 BUT WHY POETICALLY CONCEIVE SINCE WE FIND THE GERM OF EVERYTHING IN OURSELVES AND YET REMAIN FOREVER ONLY A FRAGMENT OF OURSELVES
3374-298026-0000 IT LOOKS AT ME JOYOUSLY OUT OF ITS DEEP EYES AND OPENS ITS ARMS TO EMBRACE MY SPIRIT
3374-298026-0001 THE HOLIEST AND MOST EVANESCENT OF THOSE DELICATE TRAITS AND UTTERANCES OF THE SOUL WHICH TO ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE HIGHEST SEEM LIKE BLISS ITSELF
3374-298026-0002 ARE MERELY THE COMMON ATMOSPHERE OF OUR SPIRITUAL BREATH AND LIFE THE WORDS ARE WEAK AND VAGUE
3374-298026-0003 FURTHERMORE IN THIS THRONG OF IMPRESSIONS I COULD ONLY REPEAT ANEW THE ONE INEXHAUSTIBLE FEELING OF OUR ORIGINAL HARMONY A GREAT FUTURE BECKONS ME ON INTO THE IMMEASURABLE
3374-298026-0004 EACH IDEA DEVELOPS A COUNTLESS PROGENY
3374-298026-0005 I REMEMBER EVERYTHING EVEN THE GRIEFS AND ALL MY THOUGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE TO BE
3374-298026-0006 THE BLOOD RUSHES WILDLY THROUGH MY SWOLLEN VEINS MY MOUTH THIRSTS FOR THE CONTACT OF YOUR LIPS AND MY FANCY SEEKS VAINLY AMONG THE MANY FORMS OF JOY FOR ONE
3374-298026-0007 WHICH MIGHT AT LAST GRATIFY MY DESIRE AND GIVE IT REST AND THEN AGAIN I SUDDENLY AND SADLY BETHINK ME OF THE GLOOMY TIME WHEN I WAS ALWAYS WAITING WITHOUT HOPE
3374-298026-0008 AND MADLY LOVING WITHOUT KNOWING IT WHEN MY INNERMOST BEING OVERFLOWED WITH A VAGUE LONGING WHICH IT BREATHED FORTH BUT RARELY IN HALF SUPPRESSED SIGHS
3374-298026-0009 OH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL A FAIRY TALE THAT THERE COULD BE SUCH JOY SUCH LOVE AS I NOW FEEL AND SUCH A WOMAN WHO COULD BE MY MOST TENDER BELOVED MY BEST COMPANION AND AT THE SAME TIME
3374-298026-0010 A PERFECT FRIEND FOR IT WAS IN FRIENDSHIP ESPECIALLY THAT I SOUGHT FOR WHAT I WANTED AND FOR WHAT I NEVER HOPED TO FIND IN ANY WOMAN IN YOU I FOUND IT ALL AND MORE THAN I COULD WISH FOR
3374-298026-0011 YOU KNOW NOTHING THE WOMANLINESS OF YOUR SOUL ASIDE FROM MINOR PECULIARITIES CONSISTS IN ITS REGARDING LIFE AND LOVE AS THE SAME THING FOR YOU ALL FEELING IS INFINITE AND ETERNAL
3374-298026-0012 YOU RECOGNIZE NO SEPARATIONS YOUR BEING IS AN INDIVISIBLE UNITY THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SO SERIOUS AND SO JOYOUS WHY YOU REGARD EVERYTHING IN SUCH A LARGE AND INDIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0013 THAT IS WHY YOU LOVE ME ALL OF ME AND WILL SURRENDER NO PART OF ME TO THE STATE TO POSTERITY OR TO MANLY PLEASURES I AM ALL YOURS WE ARE CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER
3374-298026-0014 AND WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER YOU ACCOMPANY ME THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF MANHOOD FROM THE UTMOST WANTONNESS TO THE MOST REFINED SPIRITUALITY IN YOU ALONE I FIRST SAW TRUE PRIDE
3374-298026-0015 AND TRUE FEMININE HUMILITY THE MOST EXTREME SUFFERING IF IT IS ONLY SURROUNDED WITHOUT SEPARATING US
3374-298026-0016 WOULD SEEM TO ME NOTHING BUT A CHARMING ANTITHESIS TO THE SUBLIME FRIVOLITY OF OUR MARRIAGE WHY SHOULD WE NOT TAKE THE HARSHEST WHIM OF CHANCE FOR AN EXCELLENT JEST AND A MOST FROLICSOME CAPRICE SINCE WE
3374-298026-0017 LIKE OUR LOVE ARE IMMORTAL I CAN NO LONGER SAY MY LOVE AND YOUR LOVE THEY ARE BOTH ALIKE IN THEIR PERFECT MUTUALITY MARRIAGE IS THE EVERLASTING UNITY AND ALLIANCE OF OUR SPIRITS
3374-298026-0018 AS THAT LAST GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE WE DRANK TOGETHER WHEN I SAID AND SO LET US DRINK OUT THE REST OF OUR LIVES
3374-298026-0019 AND SO I SAY AGAIN LET US LIVE AND LOVE I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SURVIVE ME YOU WOULD RATHER FOLLOW YOUR DYING HUSBAND INTO HIS COFFIN GLADLY AND LOVINGLY WOULD YOU DESCEND INTO THE BURNING ABYSS
3374-298026-0020 EVEN AS THE WOMEN OF INDIA DO IMPELLED BY A MAD LAW THE CRUEL CONSTRAINING PURPOSE OF WHICH DESECRATES AND DESTROYS THE MOST DELICATE SANCTITIES OF THE WILL
3374-298026-0021 ON THE OTHER SIDE PERHAPS LONGING WILL BE MORE COMPLETELY REALIZED I OFTEN WONDER OVER IT EVERY THOUGHT AND WHATEVER ELSE IS FASHIONED WITHIN US
3374-298026-0022 SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE IN ITSELF AS SINGLE AND INDIVISIBLE AS A PERSON ONE THING CROWDS OUT ANOTHER AND THAT WHICH JUST NOW WAS NEAR AND PRESENT SOON SINKS BACK INTO OBSCURITY
3374-298026-0023 AND THEN AGAIN COME MOMENTS OF SUDDEN AND UNIVERSAL CLARITY WHEN SEVERAL SUCH SPIRITS OF THE INNER WORLD COMPLETELY FUSE TOGETHER INTO A WONDERFUL WEDLOCK AND MANY A FORGOTTEN BIT OF OUR EGO SHINES FORTH IN A NEW LIGHT
3374-298026-0024 AND EVEN ILLUMINATES THE DARKNESS OF THE FUTURE WITH ITS BRIGHT LUSTRE AS IT IS IN A SMALL WAY
3374-298026-0025 I THINK IN A LARGE WAY THAT WHICH WE CALL A LIFE IS FOR THE COMPLETE INNER IMMORTAL MAN ONLY A SINGLE IDEA AN INDIVISIBLE FEELING
3374-298026-0026 AND FOR HIM THERE COME TOO MOMENTS OF THE PROFOUNDEST AND FULLEST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN ALL LIVES FALL TOGETHER AND MINGLE AND SEPARATE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0027 THE TIME IS COMING WHEN WE TWO SHALL BEHOLD IN ONE SPIRIT THAT WE ARE BLOSSOMS OF ONE PLANT OR PETALS OF ONE FLOWER WE SHALL THEN KNOW WITH A SMILE
3374-298026-0028 THAT WHAT WE NOW CALL MERELY HOPE WAS REALLY MEMORY DO YOU KNOW HOW THE FIRST SEED OF THIS IDEA GERMINATED IN MY SOUL BEFORE YOU AND TOOK ROOT IN YOURS
3374-298026-0029 WEAVE OUR LOVE EVER AND EVER MORE CLOSELY AND FIRMLY TOGETHER JUST AS A CHILD LIKE AN ECHO DOUBLES THE HAPPINESS OF ITS GENTLE PARENTS NOTHING CAN PART US
3374-298026-0030 AND CERTAINLY ANY SEPARATION WOULD ONLY DRAW ME MORE POWERFULLY TO YOU I BETHINK ME HOW AT OUR LAST EMBRACE YOU VEHEMENTLY RESISTING I BURST INTO SIMULTANEOUS TEARS AND LAUGHTER
3374-298026-0031 I TRIED TO CALM MYSELF AND IN A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS SEPARATED FROM YOU UNTIL THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS CONVINCED ME OF IT AGAINST MY WILL
3374-298026-0032 BUT THEN MY LONGING GREW AGAIN IRRESISTIBLE UNTIL ON ITS WINGS I SANK BACK INTO YOUR ARMS SUPPOSE WORDS OR A HUMAN BEING TO CREATE A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
3374-298026-0033 THE POIGNANT GRIEF WOULD BE TRANSIENT AND QUICKLY RESOLVE ITSELF INTO COMPLETE HARMONY HOW COULD SEPARATION SEPARATE US WHEN PRESENCE ITSELF IS TO US AS IT WERE TOO PRESENT
3374-298026-0034 WE HAVE TO COOL AND MITIGATE THE CONSUMING FIRE WITH JESTS AND THUS FOR US THE MOST WITTY OF THE FORMS AND SITUATIONS OF JOY IS ALSO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
3374-298026-0035 IT IS NOT MERELY THE DELIGHT OF EXHAUSTION OR THE ANTICIPATION OF REVENGE I SEE IN IT A WONDERFUL AND PROFOUNDLY SIGNIFICANT ALLEGORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND WOMAN
3374-298026-0036 INTO COMPLETE HUMANITY THAT WAS MY DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE LOVELIEST SITUATION IN THE LOVELIEST OF WORLDS I KNOW RIGHT WELL WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF IT
3374-298026-0037 AND HOW YOU TOOK IT AT THAT TIME AND I THINK I KNOW JUST AS WELL WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF IT AND HOW YOU WILL TAKE IT HERE HERE IN THIS LITTLE BOOK IN WHICH YOU EXPECT TO FIND GENUINE HISTORY PLAIN TRUTH AND CALM REASON
3374-298026-0038 YES EVEN MORALITY THE CHARMING MORALITY OF LOVE
3374-298026-0039 HOW CAN A MAN WISH TO WRITE ANYTHING WHICH IT IS SCARCELY PERMISSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE FELT
3374-298026-0040 I REPLIED
3374-298026-0041 A MAN FEELS IT HE MUST WISH TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WHAT A MAN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT HE MAY WRITE
3374-298026-0042 I WANTED FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU THAT THERE EXISTS IN THE ORIGINAL AND ESSENTIAL NATURE OF MAN A CERTAIN AWKWARD ENTHUSIASM WHICH LIKES TO UTTER BOLDLY THAT WHICH IS DELICATE AND HOLY
3374-298026-0043 AND SOMETIMES FALLS HEADLONG OVER ITS OWN HONEST ZEAL AND SPEAKS A WORD THAT IS DIVINE TO THE POINT OF COARSENESS THIS APOLOGY WOULD INDEED SAVE ME
3374-298026-0044 BUT PERHAPS ONLY AT THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE OF MY MANHOOD ITSELF FOR WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF MY MANHOOD IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE NEVERTHELESS A GREAT DEAL AGAINST THE SEX IN GENERAL
3374-298026-0045 MEANTIME I WILL BY NO MEANS MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH THEM BUT WILL RATHER EXCUSE AND DEFEND MY LIBERTY AND AUDACITY BY MEANS OF THE EXAMPLE OF THE LITTLE INNOCENT WILHELMINA
3374-298026-0046 SINCE SHE TOO IS A LADY WHOM I LOVE MOST TENDERLY
4680-16041-0000 THESE MELANCHOLY OPENINGS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE GLOOM BEFORE DESPAIR ARE TEMPTING MARIUS THRUST ASIDE THE BAR WHICH HAD SO OFTEN ALLOWED HIM TO PASS EMERGED FROM THE GARDEN AND SAID I WILL GO
4680-16041-0001 MAD WITH GRIEF NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING FIXED OR SOLID IN HIS BRAIN INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING ANYTHING THENCEFORTH OF FATE AFTER THOSE TWO MONTHS PASSED IN THE INTOXICATION OF YOUTH AND LOVE
4680-16041-0002 OVERWHELMED AT ONCE BY ALL THE REVERIES OF DESPAIR HE HAD BUT ONE DESIRE REMAINING TO MAKE A SPEEDY END OF ALL HE SET OUT AT RAPID PACE HE FOUND HIMSELF MOST OPPORTUNELY ARMED
4680-16041-0003 BY THE BOULEVARD TRAVERSED THE ESPLANADE AND THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES
4680-16041-0004 AND REACHED THE RUE DE RIVOLI THE SHOPS WERE OPEN THERE
4680-16041-0005 WOMEN WERE MAKING THEIR PURCHASES IN THE STALLS PEOPLE WERE EATING ICES IN THE CAFE LAITER AND NIBBLING SMALL CAKES AT THE ENGLISH PASTRY COOK'S SHOP
4680-16041-0006 AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CROWD INCREASED IN DENSITY FOR THE PASSERS BY NOW AMOUNTED TO A CROWD NO ONE COULD BE SEEN TO SPEAK IN THIS THRONG AND YET THERE AROSE FROM IT A DULL DEEP MURMUR
4680-16041-0007 NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF THE ARBRE SEC THERE WERE ASSEMBLAGES MOTIONLESS AND GLOOMY GROUPS WHICH WERE TO THOSE WHO WENT AND CAME AS STONES IN THE MIDST OF RUNNING WATER AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES
4680-16041-0008 THERE WERE HARDLY ANY BLACK COATS OR ROUND HATS NOW BUT SMOCK FROCKS BLOUSES CAPS AND BRISTLING AND CADAVEROUS HEADS THIS MULTITUDE UNDULATED CONFUSEDLY IN THE NOCTURNAL GLOOM
4680-16041-0009 ITS WHISPERINGS HAD THE HOARSE ACCENT OF A VIBRATION ALTHOUGH NOT ONE OF THEM WAS WALKING A DULL TRAMPLING WAS AUDIBLE IN THE MIRE BEYOND THIS DENSE PORTION OF THE THRONG IN THE RUE DU ROULE IN THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES
4680-16041-0010 ONLY THE SOLITARY AND DIMINISHING ROWS OF LANTERNS COULD BE SEEN VANISHING INTO THE STREET IN THE DISTANCE THE LANTERNS OF THAT DATE RESEMBLED LARGE RED STARS HANGING TO ROPES AND SHED UPON THE PAVEMENT A SHADOW
4680-16041-0011 WHICH HAD THE FORM OF A HUGE SPIDER THESE STREETS WERE NOT DESERTED THERE COULD BE DESCRIED PILES OF GUNS MOVING BAYONETS AND TROOPS BIVOUACKING NO CURIOUS OBSERVER PASSED THAT LIMIT THERE CIRCULATION CEASED
4680-16041-0012 THERE THE RABBLE ENDED AND THE ARMY BEGAN MARIUS WILLED WITH THE WILL OF A MAN WHO HOPES NO MORE HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED HE MUST GO HE FOUND A MEANS TO TRAVERSE THE THRONG
4680-16041-0013 HE SHUNNED THE PATROLS HE AVOIDED THE SENTINELS HE MADE A CIRCUIT REACHED THE RUE DE BETHISY

4680-16041-0017 IT HAD PASSED AND VANISHED PROCEEDING FROM CIRCUIT TO CIRCUIT HE REACHED A LANE WHICH HE JUDGED TO BE THE RUE DE LA POTERIE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET
4680-16041-0018 IT WAS AN OVERTURNED WAGON HIS FOOT RECOGNIZED POOLS OF WATER GULLIES AND PAVING STONES SCATTERED AND PILED UP
4680-16041-0019 HE CLIMBED OVER THE STONES AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRIER HE WALKED VERY NEAR THE STREET POSTS AND GUIDED HIMSELF ALONG THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES A LITTLE BEYOND THE BARRICADE IT SEEMED TO HIM
4680-16041-0020 MARIUS LEFT THE HORSES BEHIND HIM AS HE WAS APPROACHING A STREET WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE THE RUE DU CONTRAT SOCIAL A SHOT COMING NO ONE KNOWS WHENCE AND TRAVERSING THE DARKNESS AT RANDOM WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIM
4680-16041-0021 THE WHOLE OF THIS ITINERARY
4680-16041-0022 WHICH IS LIKE A CITY WITHIN A CITY
4680-16041-0023 HOLLOWED OUT IN THE CENTRE OF PARIS THERE THE GLANCE FELL INTO AN ABYSS THANKS TO THE BROKEN LANTERNS THANKS TO THE CLOSED WINDOWS THERE ALL RADIANCE ALL LIFE ALL SOUND ALL MOVEMENT CEASED
4680-16041-0024 THE INVISIBLE POLICE OF THE INSURRECTION WERE ON THE WATCH EVERYWHERE AND MAINTAINED ORDER THAT IS TO SAY NIGHT THE NECESSARY TACTICS OF INSURRECTION ARE TO DROWN SMALL NUMBERS IN A VAST OBSCURITY
4680-16041-0025 TO MULTIPLY EVERY COMBATANT BY THE POSSIBILITIES WHICH THAT OBSCURITY CONTAINS AT DUSK EVERY WINDOW WHERE A CANDLE WAS BURNING RECEIVED A SHOT THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED SOMETIMES THE INHABITANT WAS KILLED HENCE
4680-16041-0026 NOTHING WAS STIRRING THERE WAS NOTHING BUT FRIGHT MOURNING STUPOR IN THE HOUSES AND IN THE STREETS A SORT OF SACRED HORROR NOT EVEN THE LONG ROWS OF WINDOWS AND STORES THE INDENTATIONS OF THE CHIMNEYS AND THE ROOFS
4680-16041-0027 AND THE VAGUE REFLECTIONS WHICH ARE CAST BACK BY THE WET AND MUDDY PAVEMENTS WERE VISIBLE AN EYE CAST UPWARD AT THAT MASS OF SHADOWS MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE HERE AND THERE AT INTERVALS
4680-16041-0028 OF INDISTINCT GLEAMS WHICH BROUGHT OUT BROKEN AND ECCENTRIC LINES AND PROFILES OF SINGULAR BUILDINGS SOMETHING LIKE THE LIGHTS WHICH GO AND COME IN RUINS IT WAS AT SUCH POINTS THAT THE BARRICADES WERE SITUATED
4680-16041-0029 THE REST WAS A LAKE OF OBSCURITY FOGGY HEAVY AND FUNEREAL ABOVE WHICH IN MOTIONLESS AND MELANCHOLY OUTLINES ROSE THE TOWER OF SAINT JACQUES
4680-16041-0030 AND WHERE A FEW STREET LANTERNS STILL BURNED THE AERIAL OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE DISTINGUISHED THE METALLIC GLEAM OF SWORDS AND BAYONETS THE DULL RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY AND THE SWARMING OF SILENT BATTALIONS WHOSE RANKS WERE SWELLING FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE
4680-16041-0031 AND AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN ANY STREET WHICH ONE MIGHT COME TO OFFERED NOTHING BUT DARKNESS A WILD DARKNESS FULL OF TRAPS FULL OF UNSEEN AND FORMIDABLE SHOCKS INTO WHICH IT WAS ALARMING TO PENETRATE
4680-16041-0032 ALL WAS OVER NO MORE LIGHT WAS TO BE HOPED FOR HENCEFORTH EXCEPT THE LIGHTNING OF GUNS NO FURTHER ENCOUNTER EXCEPT THE ABRUPT AND RAPID APPARITION OF DEATH WHERE HOW WHEN NO ONE KNEW
4680-16041-0033 BUT IT WAS CERTAIN AND INEVITABLE IN THIS PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN MARKED OUT FOR THE STRUGGLE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURRECTION THE NATIONAL GUARD AND POPULAR SOCIETIES THE BOURGEOIS AND THE UPRISING GROPING THEIR WAY
4680-16041-0034 THAT THE MOST TIMID FELT THEMSELVES SEIZED WITH RESOLUTION AND THE MOST DARING WITH TERROR MOREOVER ON BOTH SIDES THE FURY THE RAGE AND THE DETERMINATION WERE EQUAL
4680-16041-0035 FOR THE ONE PARTY TO ADVANCE MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF RETREATING FOR THE OTHER TO REMAIN MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF FLIGHT IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT ALL SHOULD BE ENDED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
4680-16041-0036 THAT TRIUMPH SHOULD REST EITHER HERE OR THERE THAT THE INSURRECTION SHOULD PROVE ITSELF A REVOLUTION OR A SKIRMISH THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THIS AS WELL AS THE PARTIES THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT BOURGEOIS FELT IT
4680-16041-0037 HERE ONLY ONE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE A SOUND AS HEART RENDING AS THE DEATH RATTLE
4680-16041-0038 NATURE SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN INTO ACCORD WITH WHAT MEN WERE ABOUT TO DO NOTHING DISTURBED THE HARMONY OF THE WHOLE EFFECT THE STARS HAD DISAPPEARED HEAVY CLOUDS FILLED THE HORIZON WITH THEIR MELANCHOLY FOLDS
4680-16041-0039 WHICH HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SO MANY REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS WHILE YOUTH THE SECRET ASSOCIATIONS THE SCHOOLS IN THE NAME OF PRINCIPLES AND THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN THE NAME OF INTERESTS
4680-16041-0040 CLASPING AND THROWING EACH OTHER WHILE EACH ONE HASTENED AND INVITED THE LAST AND DECISIVE HOUR OF THE CRISIS FAR AWAY AND QUITE OUTSIDE OF THIS FATAL QUARTER IN THE MOST PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES OF THAT
4680-16041-0041 WRETCHED OLD PARIS WHICH DISAPPEARS UNDER THE SPLENDOR OF HAPPY AND OPULENT PARIS THE SOMBRE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE COULD BE HEARD GIVING UTTERANCE TO A DULL ROAR A FEARFUL AND SACRED VOICE
4680-16042-0000 IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THAT RED LIGHT
4680-16042-0001 HAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
4680-16042-0002 WHICH CAST A BROAD CURTAIN OF SHADOW IN WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ENGULFED HE PERCEIVED SOME LIGHT ON THE PAVEMENT A BIT OF THE WINE SHOP AND BEYOND A FLICKERING LAMP WITHIN A SORT OF SHAPELESS WALL AND MEN CROUCHING DOWN WITH GUNS ON THEIR KNEES
4680-16042-0003 ALL THIS WAS TEN FATHOMS DISTANT FROM HIM IT WAS THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THE HOUSES WHICH BORDERED THE LANE ON THE RIGHT CONCEALED THE REST OF THE WINE SHOP THE LARGE BARRICADE AND THE FLAG FROM HIM
4680-16042-0004 MARIUS HAD BUT A STEP MORE TO TAKE
4680-16042-0005 FOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC
4680-16042-0006 HIS COCKADE BLACKENED WITH POWDER HIS BROW FURROWED WITH HIS HELMET IN BARRACKS IN CAMP IN THE BIVOUAC
4680-16042-0007 AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWENTY YEARS HAD RETURNED FROM THE GREAT WARS WITH A SCARRED CHEEK A SMILING COUNTENANCE TRANQUIL ADMIRABLE PURE AS A CHILD HAVING DONE EVERYTHING FOR FRANCE AND NOTHING AGAINST HER
4680-16042-0008 TO OFFER HIS BREAST TO BAYONETS TO SHED HIS BLOOD TO SEEK THE ENEMY TO SEEK DEATH THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO WAGE WAR IN HIS TURN AND DESCEND TO THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS TO DESCEND WAS THE STREET
4680-16042-0009 HE THOUGHT OF HIS FATHER'S SWORD WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER HAD SOLD TO A SECOND HAND DEALER AND WHICH HE HAD SO MOURNFULLY REGRETTED HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT THAT CHASTE AND VALIANT SWORD HAD DONE WELL TO ESCAPE FROM HIM
4680-16042-0010 AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERS
4680-16042-0011 BLOWS GIVEN AND RECEIVED IN THE REAR IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM MARENGO AND FRIEDLAND IT DID NOT WISH TO GO TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE IT WAS BECAUSE AFTER WHAT IT HAD DONE WITH THE FATHER IT DID NOT WISH TO DO THIS FOR THE SON
4680-16042-0012 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF THAT SWORD WERE THERE IF AFTER TAKING POSSESSION OF IT AT HIS FATHER'S PILLOW HE HAD DARED TO TAKE IT AND CARRY IT OFF FOR THIS COMBAT OF DARKNESS BETWEEN FRENCHMEN IN THE STREETS
4680-16042-0013 IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL
4680-16042-0014 WOUND THE SIDE OF HIS COUNTRY AND THEN HE FELL TO WEEPING BITTERLY THIS WAS HORRIBLE BUT WHAT WAS HE TO DO LIVE WITHOUT COSETTE HE COULD NOT SINCE SHE WAS GONE HE MUST NEEDS DIE
4680-16042-0015 HAD HE NOT GIVEN HER HIS WORD OF HONOR THAT HE WOULD DIE SHE HAD GONE KNOWING THAT THIS MEANT THAT IT PLEASED HER THAT MARIUS SHOULD DIE AND THEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE NO LONGER LOVED HIM
4680-16042-0016 SHOULD HE RETREAT AFTER GOING SO FAR SHOULD HE FLEE FROM DANGER AFTER HAVING APPROACHED IT SHOULD HE SLIP AWAY AFTER HAVING COME AND PEEPED INTO THE BARRICADE SLIP AWAY ALL IN A TREMBLE SAYING AFTER ALL I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AS IT IS
4680-16042-0017 WHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM
4680-16042-0018 ALL AT ONCE HE RAISED IT A SORT OF SPLENDID RECTIFICATION HAD JUST BEEN EFFECTED IN HIS MIND THERE IS A WIDENING OF THE SPHERE OF THOUGHT WHICH IS PECULIAR TO THE VICINITY OF THE GRAVE
4680-16042-0019 IT MAKES ONE SEE CLEARLY TO BE NEAR DEATH THE VISION OF THE ACTION INTO WHICH HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING APPEARED TO HIM NO MORE AS LAMENTABLE BUT AS SUPERB
4680-16042-0020 HE LEFT NONE OF THEM UNANSWERED LET US SEE WHY SHOULD HIS FATHER BE INDIGNANT ARE THERE NOT CASES WHERE INSURRECTION RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF DUTY
4680-16042-0021 CIVIL WAR WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THERE A FOREIGN WAR IS NOT ALL WAR BETWEEN MEN WAR BETWEEN BROTHERS WAR IS QUALIFIED ONLY BY ITS OBJECT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FOREIGN OR CIVIL WAR
4680-16042-0022 THERE IS ONLY JUST AND UNJUST WAR UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE GRAND HUMAN AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED WAR THAT AT LEAST WHICH IS THE EFFORT OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS HASTENING ON AGAINST THE PAST WHICH IS LAGGING IN THE REAR MAY BE NECESSARY
4680-16042-0023 WHETHER FOREIGN OR CIVIL IS INIQUITOUS IT IS CALLED CRIME OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THAT HOLY THING JUSTICE BY WHAT RIGHT DOES ONE FORM OF MAN DESPISE ANOTHER BY WHAT RIGHT SHOULD THE SWORD OF WASHINGTON
4680-16042-0024 THE ONE IS THE DEFENDER THE OTHER THE LIBERATOR SHALL WE BRAND EVERY APPEAL TO ARMS WITHIN A CITY'S LIMITS WITHOUT TAKING THE OBJECT INTO A CONSIDERATION THEN NOTE THE INFAMY OF BRUTUS MARCEL ARNOULD VON BLANKENHEIM COLIGNY HEDGEROW WAR
4680-16042-0025 WAR OF THE STREETS WHY NOT THAT WAS THE WAR OF AMBIORIX OF ARTEVELDE OF MARNIX OF PELAGIUS BUT AMBIORIX FOUGHT AGAINST ROME ARTEVELDE AGAINST FRANCE
4680-16042-0026 AN INVASION VIOLATES THE GEOGRAPHICAL FRONTIER DRIVING OUT THE TYRANT OR DRIVING OUT THE ENGLISH IN BOTH CASES REGAINING POSSESSION OF ONE'S OWN TERRITORY THERE COMES AN HOUR WHEN PROTESTATION NO LONGER SUFFICES
4680-16042-0027 THE TENTH OF AUGUST ELECTRIFIES THEM
4680-16042-0028 AFTER DIDEROT DANTON MULTITUDES HAVE A TENDENCY TO ACCEPT THE MASTER THEIR MASS BEARS WITNESS TO APATHY A CROWD IS EASILY LED AS A WHOLE TO OBEDIENCE MEN MUST BE STIRRED UP PUSHED ON
4680-16042-0029 TREATED ROUGHLY BY THE VERY BENEFIT OF THEIR DELIVERANCE THEIR EYES MUST BE WOUNDED BY THE TRUE LIGHT MUST BE HURLED AT THEM IN TERRIBLE HANDFULS
4680-16042-0030 OF WHOM ARE YOU SPEAKING DO YOU CALL LOUIS PHILIPPE THE TYRANT NO
4680-16042-0031 ARE WHAT HISTORY IS IN THE HABIT OF CALLING GOOD KINGS BUT PRINCIPLES ARE NOT TO BE PARCELLED OUT THE LOGIC OF THE TRUE IS RECTILINEAR THE PECULIARITY OF TRUTH IS THAT IT LACKS COMPLAISANCE NO CONCESSIONS THEN
4680-16042-0032 BOTH REPRESENT IN A CERTAIN MEASURE THE CONFISCATION OF RIGHT AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR AWAY UNIVERSAL INSURRECTION THEY MUST BE COMBATED IT MUST BE DONE FRANCE BEING ALWAYS THE ONE TO BEGIN
4680-16042-0033 WHEN THE MASTER FALLS IN FRANCE HE FALLS EVERYWHERE IN SHORT WHAT CAUSE IS MORE JUST AND CONSEQUENTLY WHAT WAR IS GREATER THAN THAT WHICH RE ESTABLISHES SOCIAL TRUTH
4680-16042-0034 RESTORES THE PEOPLE TO THE PEOPLE RESTORES SOVEREIGNTY TO MAN REPLACES THE PURPLE ON THE HEAD OF FRANCE RESTORES EQUITY AND REASON IN THEIR PLENITUDE SUPPRESSES EVERY GERM OF ANTAGONISM BY RESTORING EACH ONE TO HIMSELF
4680-16042-0035 ANNIHILATES THE OBSTACLE WHICH ROYALTY PRESENTS TO THE WHOLE IMMENSE UNIVERSAL CONCORD AND PLACES THE HUMAN RACE ONCE MORE ON A LEVEL WITH THE RIGHT THESE WARS BUILD UP PEACE
4680-16042-0036 THERE IS NO ONE WHO HAS NOT NOTICED IT IN HIS OWN CASE THE SOUL AND THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF ITS UNITY COMPLICATED WITH UBIQUITY HAS A STRANGE APTITUDE FOR REASONING ALMOST COLDLY IN THE MOST VIOLENT EXTREMITIES
4680-16042-0037 WITHOUT MOVING AND THERE WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT QUASI SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE LAST STAGE OF EXPECTATION OVERHEAD AT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE THIRD STORY MARIUS DESCRIED A SORT OF SPECTATOR WHO APPEARED TO HIM TO BE SINGULARLY ATTENTIVE
4680-16042-0038 THIS WAS THE PORTER WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY LE CABUC BELOW BY THE LIGHTS OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS THRUST BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES THIS HEAD COULD BE VAGUELY DISTINGUISHED NOTHING COULD BE STRANGER IN THAT SOMBRE AND UNCERTAIN GLEAM
4680-16042-0039 ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE MAN WHO WAS DEAD WAS SURVEYING THOSE WHO WERE ABOUT TO DIE A LONG TRAIL OF BLOOD WHICH HAD FLOWED FROM THAT HEAD DESCENDED IN REDDISH THREADS FROM THE WINDOW TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FIRST FLOOR
2416-152139-0000 HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS

2416-152139-0007 WAVED HIS HAND TAKE A CHAIR HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNING IN THE ACT OF DROPPING INTO HIS OWN CHAIR GRASPED SUDDENLY AT THE EDGE OF THE DESK INSTEAD
2416-152139-0008 AND WITH A LOW STARTLED CRY STARED ACROSS THE ROOM JIMMIE DALE WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE DOOR THAT WAS CLOSED NOW BEHIND HIM AND ON JIMMIE DALE'S FACE WAS A BLACK SILK MASK
2416-152139-0009 FOR AN INSTANT NEITHER MAN SPOKE NOR MOVED THEN CARLING SPARE BUILT DAPPER IN EVENING CLOTHES EDGED BACK FROM THE DESK AND LAUGHED A LITTLE UNCERTAINLY
2416-152139-0010 AS HE SMILED IN PRIVATE YOU'VE A STRANGE METHOD OF SECURING PRIVACY HAVEN'T YOU A BIT MELODRAMATIC ISN'T IT
2416-152139-0011 JIMMIE DALE SMILED INDULGENTLY MY MASK IS ONLY FOR EFFECT HE SAID MY NAME IS SMITH YES SAID CARLING I AM VERY STUPID THANK YOU
2416-152139-0012 HE HAD REACHED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM NOW AND WITH A QUICK SUDDEN MOVEMENT JERKED HIS HAND TO THE DIAL OF THE SAFE THAT STOOD AGAINST THE WALL BUT JIMMIE DALE WAS QUICKER WITHOUT SHIFTING HIS POSITION HIS AUTOMATIC WHIPPED FROM HIS POCKET

2416-152139-0016 JIMMIE DALE MOVED OVER AND STOOD IN FRONT OF CARLING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DESK AND STARED SILENTLY AT THE IMMACULATE FASHIONABLY GROOMED FIGURE BEFORE HIM UNDER THE PROLONGED GAZE CARLING'S COMPOSURE
2416-152139-0017 IN A MEASURE AT LEAST SEEMED TO FORSAKE HIM HE BEGAN TO DRUM NERVOUSLY WITH HIS FINGERS ON THE DESK AND SHIFT UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR AND THEN FROM FIRST ONE POCKET AND THEN THE OTHER
2416-152139-0018 SAID JIMMIE DALE SLOWLY I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT YOUR BANK WAS ROBBED THIS EVENING AT CLOSING TIME I UNDERSTAND YES CARLING'S VOICE WAS EXCITED NOW

2416-152139-0038 IT WAS ENOUGH WASN'T IT WHAT CHANCE HAD HE JIMMIE DALE PAUSED HIS LEFT HAND CLENCHED UNTIL THE SKIN FORMED WHITISH KNOBS OVER THE KNUCKLES CARLING'S TONGUE SOUGHT HIS LIPS MADE A CIRCUIT OF THEM

2416-152139-0049 AND IT WAS SAFER MUCH MORE CIRCUMSPECT ON YOUR PART NOT TO ORDER THE FLAT SEARCHED AT ONCE BUT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT AS IT WERE AFTER YOU HAD LED THE POLICE TO TRAIL HIM ALL EVENING AND STILL REMAIN WITHOUT A CLEW
2416-152139-0050 AND BESIDES OF COURSE NOT UNTIL YOU HAD PLANTED THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS TO DAMN HIM AND WRECK HIS LIFE AND HOME YOU WERE EVEN GENEROUS IN THE AMOUNT YOU DEPRIVED YOURSELF OF OUT OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
2416-152139-0051 EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD DONE THE JOB AND HAD THE BALANCE SOMEWHERE WHAT WOULD HIS DENIALS HIS PROTESTATIONS OF INNOCENCE COUNT FOR HE WAS AN EX CONVICT A HARDENED CRIMINAL CAUGHT RED HANDED WITH A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF ROBBERY
2416-152139-0052 AND THEN JIMMIE DALE LAUGHED NOT PLEASANTLY YES THERE'S A WAY CARLING HE SAID GRIMLY THAT'S WHY I'M HERE HE PICKED UP A SHEET OF WRITING PAPER AND PUSHED IT ACROSS THE DESK THEN A PEN

2416-152139-0058 THE PEN SPLUTTERED ON THE PAPER A BEAD OF SWEAT SPURTING FROM THE MAN'S FOREHEAD DROPPED TO THE SHEET THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROOM A MINUTE PASSED ANOTHER
2416-152139-0059 CARLING'S PEN TRAVELLED HALTINGLY ACROSS THE PAPER THEN WITH A QUEER LOW CRY AS HE SIGNED HIS NAME HE DROPPED THE PEN FROM HIS FINGERS AND RISING UNSTEADILY FROM HIS CHAIR

2416-152139-0061 THOMAS H CARLING FROM THE PAPER JIMMIE DALE'S EYES SHIFTED TO THE FIGURE BY THE COUCH AND THE PAPER FLUTTERED SUDDENLY FROM HIS FINGERS TO THE DESK CARLING WAS REELING CLUTCHING AT HIS THROAT
2416-152139-0062 A SMALL GLASS VIAL ROLLED UPON THE CARPET AND THEN EVEN AS JIMMIE DALE SPRANG FORWARD THE OTHER PITCHED HEAD LONG OVER THE COUCH AND IN A MOMENT IT WAS OVER PRESENTLY JIMMIE DALE PICKED UP THE VIAL
2416-152139-0063 AND DROPPED IT BACK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN THERE WAS NO LABEL ON IT BUT IT NEEDED NONE THE STRONG PENETRATING ODOR OF BITTER ALMONDS WAS TELLTALE EVIDENCE ENOUGH IT WAS PRUSSIC
2416-152139-0064 OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
2416-152139-0065 MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
2416-152139-0066 STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS
2416-152139-0067 WHO KNEW AND THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY NOW SINCE THE MAN WAS DEAD JIMMIE DALE PUT THE PIECES IN HIS POCKET WENT TO THE SAFE OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT A PARCEL LOCKED THE SAFE CAREFULLY

2416-152139-0069 FROM HIS POCKET HE TOOK OUT THE THIN METAL INSIGNIA CASE AND WITH THE TINY TWEEZERS LIFTED UP ONE OF THE GRAY COLOURED DIAMOND SHAPED PAPER SEALS HE MOISTENED THE ADHESIVE SIDE AND
2416-152139-0070 STILL HOLDING IT BY THE TWEEZERS DROPPED IT ON HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND PRESSED THE SEAL DOWN ON THE FACE OF THE TOPMOST PACKAGE OF BANKNOTES HE TIED THE PARCEL UP THEN AND PICKING UP THE PEN ADDRESSED IT IN PRINTED CHARACTERS
2416-152139-0071 WITH THE PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM STEPPED TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT HE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT ON THE THRESHOLD FOR A SINGLE QUICK COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN PASSED ON OUT INTO THE STREET
2416-152139-0072 AT THE CORNER HE STOPPED TO LIGHT A CIGARETTE AND THE FLAME OF THE MATCH SPURTING UP DISCLOSED A FACE THAT WAS WORN AND HAGGARD HE THREW THE MATCH AWAY SMILED A LITTLE WEARILY AND WENT ON
426-122822-0000 A JONAH DAY IT REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A RESTLESS WAKEFUL VIGIL OF GRUMBLING TOOTHACHE WHEN ANNE AROSE IN THE DULL BITTER WINTER MORNING SHE FELT THAT LIFE WAS FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
426-122822-0001 SHE WENT TO SCHOOL IN NO ANGELIC MOOD HER CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN AND HER FACE ACHED THE SCHOOLROOM WAS COLD AND SMOKY FOR THE FIRE REFUSED TO BURN AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUDDLED ABOUT IT IN SHIVERING GROUPS
426-122822-0002 ANTHONY PYE STRUTTED TO HIS WITH HIS USUAL IMPERTINENT SWAGGER AND SHE SAW HIM WHISPER SOMETHING TO HIS SEAT MATE AND THEN GLANCE AT HER WITH A GRIN NEVER SO IT SEEMED TO ANNE HAD THERE BEEN SO MANY SQUEAKY PENCILS AS THERE WERE THAT MORNING
426-122822-0003 AND WHEN BARBARA SHAW CAME UP TO THE DESK WITH A SUM SHE TRIPPED OVER THE COAL SCUTTLE WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THE COAL ROLLED TO EVERY PART OF THE ROOM HER SLATE WAS BROKEN INTO FRAGMENTS AND WHEN SHE PICKED HERSELF UP HER FACE STAINED WITH COAL DUST SENT THE BOYS INTO ROARS OF LAUGHTER
426-122822-0004 ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
426-122822-0005 PLEASE MISS I HAD TO HELP MA MAKE A PUDDING FOR DINNER CAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING COMPANY AND CLARICE ALMIRA'S SICK WAS SAINT CLAIR'S ANSWER GIVEN IN A PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL VOICE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROVOCATIVE OF GREAT MIRTH AMONG HIS MATES
426-122822-0006 TAKE YOUR SEAT AND WORK OUT THE SIX PROBLEMS ON PAGE EIGHTY FOUR OF YOUR ARITHMETIC FOR PUNISHMENT SAID ANNE SAINT CLAIR LOOKED RATHER AMAZED AT HER TONE BUT HE WENT MEEKLY TO HIS DESK AND TOOK OUT HIS SLATE THEN HE STEALTHILY PASSED A SMALL PARCEL TO JOE SLOANE ACROSS THE AISLE
426-122822-0007 ANNE CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND JUMPED TO A FATAL CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT PARCEL OLD MISSUS HIRAM SLOANE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO MAKING AND SELLING NUT CAKES BY WAY OF ADDING TO HER SCANTY INCOME THE CAKES WERE SPECIALLY TEMPTING TO SMALL BOYS
426-122822-0008 ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
426-122822-0009 REALLY HELD AN ASSORTMENT OF FIRECRACKERS AND PINWHEELS FOR WHICH WARREN SLOANE HAD SENT TO TOWN BY SAINT CLAIR DONNELL'S FATHER THE DAY BEFORE INTENDING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION THAT EVENING
426-122822-0010 JOE SLOANE STOOD AS ONE TRANSFIXED IN THE MIDST OF THE COMMOTION AND SAINT CLAIR HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER ROCKED TO AND FRO IN THE AISLE PRILLIE ROGERSON FAINTED AND ANNETTA BELL WENT INTO HYSTERICS
426-122822-0011 ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
426-122822-0012 WHERE BARBARA SHAW IN AN AGONY OF DESIRE TO BE USEFUL POURED A PAILFUL OF HALF FROZEN WATER OVER PRILLIE'S FACE AND SHOULDERS BEFORE ANYONE COULD STOP HER IT WAS A FULL HOUR BEFORE QUIET WAS RESTORED
426-122822-0013 EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
426-122822-0014 CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
426-122822-0015 BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
426-122822-0016 HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
426-122822-0017 ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
426-122822-0018 HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
426-122822-0019 ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
426-122822-0020 ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
426-122822-0021 EVEN THE STORMY SOULED ANNE SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT COULD NOT HAVE PUNISHED ANY CHILD CRUELLY BUT THE POINTER NIPPED KEENLY AND FINALLY ANTHONY'S BRAVADO FAILED HIM HE WINCED AND THE TEARS CAME TO HIS EYES ANNE CONSCIENCE STRICKEN DROPPED THE POINTER AND TOLD ANTHONY TO GO TO HIS SEAT
426-122822-0022 SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
426-122822-0023 KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
426-122822-0024 THE TROUBLE IS I'VE GOT THINGS THE MATTER WITH MY CONSCIENCE SOBBED ANNE OH THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A JONAH DAY MARILLA I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF I LOST MY TEMPER AND WHIPPED ANTHONY PYE I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID MARILLA WITH DECISION
426-122822-0025 IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
426-122822-0026 OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS
426-122822-0027 WHEN ANNE'S SOBS GREW QUIETER SHE SAID VERY GENTLY FOR HER YOU TAKE THINGS TOO MUCH TO HEART ANNE WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT PEOPLE FORGET THEM AND JONAH DAYS COME TO EVERYBODY AS FOR ANTHONY PYE WHY NEED YOU CARE IF HE DOES DISLIKE YOU
426-122822-0028 HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
426-122822-0029 JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL SEE IF A GOOD CUP OF TEA AND THOSE PLUM PUFFS I MADE TODAY WON'T HEARTEN YOU UP PLUM PUFFS WON'T MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED SAID ANNE DISCONSOLATELY
426-122822-0030 IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
426-122822-0031 EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
426-122822-0032 ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
426-122822-0033 BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
426-122822-0034 MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
426-122822-0035 NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
426-122821-0000 TEACHING IS REALLY VERY INTERESTING WORK WROTE ANNE TO A QUEEN'S ACADEMY CHUM JANE SAYS SHE THINKS IT IS MONOTONOUS BUT I DON'T FIND IT SO SOMETHING FUNNY IS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY AND THE CHILDREN SAY SUCH AMUSING THINGS
426-122821-0001 IT WAS BECAUSE JIMMY CALLED HIM SAINT CLAIR THAT SAINT CLAIR POUNDED HIM ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL I HEARD OF THE POUNDING BUT NOT OFFICIALLY SO I DON'T THINK I'LL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT YESTERDAY I WAS TRYING TO TEACH LOTTIE WRIGHT TO DO ADDITION I SAID
426-122821-0002 BECAUSE IT WOULD RAIN THE NEXT DAY IT'S SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH STELLA I HAVE TO SAVE UP ALL MY AMUSEMENT UNTIL I GET HOME AND MARILLA SAYS IT MAKES HER NERVOUS TO HEAR WILD SHRIEKS OF MIRTH PROCEEDING FROM THE EAST GABLE WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
426-122821-0003 DID YOU KNOW THAT THOMAS A BECKET WAS CANONIZED AS A SNAKE ROSE BELL SAYS HE WAS ALSO THAT WILLIAM TYNDALE WROTE THE NEW TESTAMENT CLAUDE WHITE SAYS A GLACIER IS A MAN WHO PUTS IN WINDOW FRAMES

426-122821-0005 BUT IF YOU WERE A WIDOW THERE'D BE NO DANGER OF EITHER THE MOST REMARKABLE WISH WAS SALLY BELL'S SHE WANTED A HONEYMOON

426-122821-0035 THEN THERE ARE THE TWIN SAILORS THEY DON'T LIVE ANYWHERE THEY SAIL ALL THE TIME BUT THEY OFTEN COME ASHORE TO TALK TO ME THEY ARE A PAIR OF JOLLY TARS AND THEY HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND MORE THAN WHAT IS IN THE WORLD

426-122821-0037 HE HAD SOME WONDERFUL ADVENTURES IN THE MOON BUT IT WOULD MAKE THIS LETTER TOO LONG TO TELL THEM THEN THERE IS THE GOLDEN LADY OF THE CAVE ONE DAY I FOUND A BIG CAVE DOWN ON THE SHORE AND I WENT AWAY IN AND AFTER A WHILE I FOUND THE GOLDEN LADY

426-122821-0042 BUT THE OLDEST TWIN SAYS IT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES YOU SEE IN THE SUNSET LAND THE TIME IS EVER SO MUCH LONGER THAN IT IS HERE YOUR LOVING PUPIL PAUL IRVING
7635-105661-0000 THE PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE FINANCES ARMIES FLEETS AND MAGISTRACY ARE INSTANCES OF THIS ORDER OF MEN IT MAY NATURALLY BE THOUGHT AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE ECCLESIASTICS BELONG TO THE FIRST CLASS AND THAT THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL AS THAT OF LAWYERS AND PHYSICIANS
7635-105661-0001 MAY SAFELY BE INTRUSTED TO THE LIBERALITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR DOCTRINES AND WHO FIND BENEFIT OR CONSOLATION FROM THEIR SPIRITUAL MINISTRY AND ASSISTANCE
7635-105661-0002 FROM THEIR INCREASING PRACTICE STUDY AND ATTENTION BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY WE SHALL FIND THAT THIS INTERESTED DILIGENCE OF THE CLERGY IS WHAT EVERY WISE LEGISLATOR WILL STUDY TO PREVENT BECAUSE IN EVERY RELIGION EXCEPT THE TRUE IT IS HIGHLY PERNICIOUS
7635-105661-0003 AND IT HAS EVEN A NATURAL TENDENCY TO PERVERT THE TRUE BY INFUSING INTO IT A STRONG MIXTURE OF SUPERSTITION FOLLY AND DELUSION EACH GHOSTLY PRACTITIONER IN ORDER TO RENDER HIMSELF MORE PRECIOUS AND SACRED IN THE EYES OF HIS RETAINERS
7635-105661-0004 WILL INSPIRE THEM WITH THE MOST VIOLENT ABHORRENCE OF ALL OTHER SECTS AND CONTINUALLY ENDEAVOR BY SOME NOVELTY TO EXCITE THE LANGUID DEVOTION OF HIS AUDIENCE NO REGARD WILL BE PAID TO TRUTH MORALS OR DECENCY IN THE DOCTRINES INCULCATED
7635-105661-0005 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0006 AND IN THE END THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE WILL FIND THAT HE HAS DEARLY PAID FOR HIS PRETENDED FRUGALITY IN SAVING A FIXED ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE PRIESTS AND THAT IN REALITY THE MOST DECENT AND ADVANTAGEOUS COMPOSITION WHICH HE CAN MAKE WITH THE SPIRITUAL GUIDES
7635-105661-0007 IS TO BRIBE THEIR INDOLENCE BY ASSIGNING STATED SALARIES TO THEIR PROFESSION AND RENDERING IT SUPERFLUOUS FOR THEM TO BE FURTHER ACTIVE THAN MERELY TO PREVENT THEIR FLOCK FROM STRAYING IN QUEST OF NEW PASTURES
7635-105661-0008 AND IN THIS MANNER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THOUGH COMMONLY THEY AROSE AT FIRST FROM RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROVE IN THE END ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
7635-105661-0009 BUT WE MAY OBSERVE THAT FEW ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN FIXED UPON A WORSE FOUNDATION THAN THAT OF THE CHURCH OF ROME OR HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES MORE HURTFUL TO THE PEACE AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND
7635-105661-0010 THE LARGE REVENUES PRIVILEGES IMMUNITIES AND POWERS OF THE CLERGY RENDERED THEM FORMIDABLE TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE AND ARMED WITH TOO EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY AN ORDER OF MEN WHO ALWAYS ADHERE CLOSELY TOGETHER
7635-105661-0011 THE HIGHER DIGNITIES OF THE CHURCH SERVED INDEED TO THE SUPPORT OF GENTRY AND NOBILITY BUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONASTERIES MANY OF THE LOWEST VULGAR WERE TAKEN FROM THE USEFUL ARTS AND MAINTAINED IN THOSE RECEPTACLES OF SLOTH AND IGNORANCE
7635-105661-0012 THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH WAS A FOREIGN POTENTATE GUIDED BY INTERESTS ALWAYS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO THEM AND AS THE HIERARCHY WAS NECESSARILY SOLICITOUS TO PRESERVE A UNITY OF FAITH RITES AND CEREMONIES
7635-105661-0013 ALL LIBERTY OF THOUGHT RAN A MANIFEST RISK OF BEING EXTINGUISHED AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS OR WHAT WAS WORSE A STUPID AND ABJECT CREDULITY TOOK PLACE EVERY WHERE TO INCREASE THESE EVILS THE CHURCH
7635-105661-0014 THOUGH SHE POSSESSED LARGE REVENUES WAS NOT CONTENTED WITH HER ACQUISITIONS
7635-105661-0015 SHE EVEN BESTOWED ON EACH INDIVIDUAL PRIEST A POWER OF ENRICHING HIMSELF BY THE VOLUNTARY OBLATIONS OF THE FAITHFUL AND LEFT HIM STILL AN URGENT MOTIVE FOR DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY IN HIS CALLING
7635-105661-0016 AND THUS THAT CHURCH THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE AND BURDENSOME ESTABLISHMENT WAS LIABLE TO MANY OF THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH BELONG TO AN ORDER OF PRIESTS TRUSTING ENTIRELY TO THEIR OWN ART AND INVENTION FOR OBTAINING A SUBSISTENCE
7635-105661-0017 THE ADVANTAGES ATTENDING THE ROMISH HIERARCHY WERE BUT A SMALL COMPENSATION FOR ITS INCONVENIENCES THE ECCLESIASTICAL PRIVILEGES DURING BARBAROUS TIMES
7635-105661-0018 AND THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF WORSHIP WHICH BELONGED TO SO OPULENT AN ESTABLISHMENT CONTRIBUTED IN SOME RESPECT TO THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE FINE ARTS AND BEGAN TO DIFFUSE A GENERAL ELEGANCE OF TASTE BY UNITING IT WITH RELIGION
7635-105661-0019 IT WILL EASILY BE CONCEIVED THAT THOUGH THE BALANCE OF EVIL PREVAILED IN THE ROMISH CHURCH THIS WAS NOT THE CHIEF REASON WHICH PRODUCED THE REFORMATION A CONCURRENCE OF INCIDENTS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO FORWARD THAT GREAT REVOLUTION
7635-105661-0020 IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HIS PROJECTS PLEASURES AND LIBERALITIES THE SCHEME OF SELLING INDULGENCES WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM AS AN EXPEDIENT WHICH HAD OFTEN SERVED IN FORMER TIMES TO DRAW MONEY FROM THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
7635-105661-0021 AND MAKE DEVOUT PEOPLE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GRANDEUR AND RICHES OF THE COURT OF ROME THE CHURCH IT WAS SUPPOSED WAS POSSESSED OF A GREAT STOCK OF MERIT AS BEING ENTITLED TO ALL THE GOOD WORKS OF ALL THE SAINTS BEYOND WHAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN JUSTIFICATION
7635-105661-0022 AND EVEN TO THE MERITS OF CHRIST HIMSELF WHICH WERE INFINITE AND UNBOUNDED AND FROM THIS UNEXHAUSTED TREASURY THE POPE MIGHT RETAIL PARTICULAR PORTIONS AND BY THAT TRAFFIC ACQUIRE MONEY TO BE EMPLOYED IN PIOUS PURPOSES IN RESISTING THE INFIDELS
7635-105661-0023 OR SUBDUING SCHISMATICS WHEN THE MONEY CAME INTO HIS EXCHEQUER THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS USUALLY DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT LEO FROM THE PENETRATION OF HIS GENIUS AND HIS FAMILIARITY WITH ANCIENT LITERATURE
7635-105661-0024 WAS FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE RIDICULE AND FALSITY OF THE DOCTRINES WHICH AS SUPREME PONTIFF
7635-105661-0025 MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
7635-105661-0026 AS YET AND TILL LONG AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS NEITHER IS THERE ANY INSTANCE THAT ARGUMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THAT ENORMOUS LOAD OF ABSURDITY
7635-105661-0027 WITH WHICH SUPERSTITION HAS EVERY WHERE OVERWHELMED THEM NOT TO MENTION THAT THE RAPID ADVANCE OF THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AND THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH IT WAS EMBRACED PROVE SUFFICIENTLY THAT IT OWED NOT ITS SUCCESS TO REASON AND REFLECTION
7635-105661-0028 WERE PROPAGATED MORE QUICKLY AND IN GREATER NUMBERS THE MINDS OF MEN SOMEWHAT AWAKENED FROM A PROFOUND SLEEP OF SO MANY CENTURIES WERE PREPARED FOR EVERY NOVELTY AND SCRUPLED LESS TO TREAD IN ANY UNUSUAL PATH WHICH WAS OPENED TO THEM
7635-105661-0029 AND AS COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH BECAME MORE COMMON
7635-105661-0030 MANY OF THE POWERS INDEED ASSUMED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME WERE VERY ANCIENT AND WERE PRIOR TO ALMOST EVERY POLITICAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE
7635-105661-0031 WHICH TIME MIGHT RENDER VALID BUT APPEALED STILL TO A DIVINE ORIGIN MEN WERE TEMPTED TO LOOK INTO THEIR PRIMITIVE CHARTER AND THEY COULD WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY PERCEIVE ITS DEFECT IN TRUTH AND AUTHENTICITY
7635-105661-0032 IN ORDER TO BESTOW ON THIS TOPIC THE GREATER INFLUENCE LUTHER AND HIS FOLLOWERS NOT SATISFIED WITH OPPOSING THE PRETENDED DIVINITY OF THE ROMISH CHURCH AND DISPLAYING THE TEMPORAL INCONVENIENCES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT
7635-105661-0033 CARRIED MATTERS MUCH FURTHER AND TREATED THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS AS ABOMINABLE DETESTABLE DAMNABLE FORETOLD BY SACRED WRIT ITSELF AS THE SOURCE OF ALL WICKEDNESS AND POLLUTION THEY DENOMINATED THE POPE ANTICHRIST
7635-105661-0034 CALLED HIS COMMUNION THE SCARLET WHORE AND GAVE TO ROME THE APPELLATION OF BABYLON EXPRESSIONS WHICH HOWEVER APPLIED WERE TO BE FOUND IN SCRIPTURE AND WHICH WERE BETTER CALCULATED TO OPERATE ON THE MULTITUDE THAN THE MOST SOLID ARGUMENTS
7635-105661-0035 EXCITED BY CONTEST AND PERSECUTION ON THE ONE HAND BY SUCCESS AND APPLAUSE ON THE OTHER MANY OF THE REFORMERS CARRIED TO THE GREATEST EXTREMITIES THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE CHURCH OF ROME
7635-105661-0036 AND IN CONTRADICTION TO THE MULTIPLIED SUPERSTITIONS WITH WHICH THAT COMMUNION WAS LOADED THEY ADOPTED AN ENTHUSIASTIC STRAIN OF DEVOTION WHICH ADMITTED OF NO OBSERVANCES RITES OR CEREMONIES BUT PLACED ALL MERIT
7635-105661-0037 IN A MYSTERIOUS SPECIES OF FAITH IN INWARD VISION RAPTURE AND ECSTASY THE NEW SECTARIES SEIZED WITH THIS SPIRIT WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THE PROPAGATION OF THEIR DOCTRINE
7635-105661-0038 AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE LUTHERANS ADVANCED DOCTRINES FAVORABLE IN SOME RESPECT TO THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF SOVEREIGNS THEY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0039 IN THOSE POWERS OF WHICH THE ENCROACHING SPIRIT OF THE ECCLESIASTICS ESPECIALLY OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HAD SO LONG BEREAVED THEM THEY CONDEMNED CELIBACY AND MONASTIC VOWS AND THEREBY OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CONVENTS
7635-105661-0040 TO THOSE WHO WERE EITHER TIRED OF THE OBEDIENCE AND CHASTITY OR DISGUSTED WITH THE LICENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO LIVED THEY BLAMED THE EXCESSIVE RICHES THE IDLENESS
7635-105661-0041 THE LIBERTINISM OF THE CLERGY AND POINTED OUT THEIR TREASURES AND REVENUES AS LAWFUL SPOIL TO THE FIRST INVADER AND AS THE ECCLESIASTICS HAD HITHERTO CONDUCTED A WILLING AND A STUPID AUDIENCE AND WERE TOTALLY UNACQUAINTED WITH CONTROVERSY MUCH MORE
7635-105661-0042 WITH EVERY SPECIES OF TRUE LITERATURE THEY WERE UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST MEN ARMED WITH AUTHORITIES QUOTATIONS AND POPULAR TOPICS AND QUALIFIED TO TRIUMPH IN EVERY ALTERCATION OR DEBATE
7635-105661-0043 DIED IN THE FLOWER OF HIS AGE A LITTLE AFTER HE RECEIVED THE KING'S BOOK AGAINST LUTHER AND HE WAS SUCCEEDED IN THE PAPAL CHAIR BY ADRIAN A FLEMING WHO HAD BEEN TUTOR TO THE EMPEROR CHARLES THIS MAN WAS FITTED TO GAIN ON THE REFORMERS BY THE INTEGRITY CANDOR
7635-105661-0044 AND SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS CHARACTER BUT SO VIOLENT WERE THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST THE CHURCH HE RATHER HURT THE CAUSE BY HIS IMPRUDENT EXERCISE OF THOSE VIRTUES HE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT MANY ABOMINABLE AND DETESTABLE PRACTICES PREVAILED IN THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0045 AND BY THIS SINCERE AVOWAL HE GAVE OCCASION OF MUCH TRIUMPH TO THE LUTHERANS THIS PONTIFF ALSO WHOSE PENETRATION WAS NOT EQUAL TO HIS GOOD INTENTIONS WAS SEDUCED TO CONCUR IN THAT LEAGUE WHICH CHARLES AND HENRY HAD FORMED AGAINST FRANCE
7635-105661-0046 AND WHO DREADED THE RESENTMENT OF THAT HAUGHTY MINISTER WAS SOLICITOUS TO REPAIR THE BREACH MADE IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY THIS INCIDENT
7635-105661-0047 HE RENEWED TO WOLSEY ALL THE PROMISES WHICH HE HAD MADE HIM OF SECONDING HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE PAPAL THRONE
7635-105661-0048 TO THE NEXT ELECTION THE EMPEROR RENEWED THE TREATY MADE AT BRUGES
7635-105661-0049 THE MORE TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HENRY AND THE ENGLISH NATION HE GAVE TO SURREY ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND A COMMISSION FOR BEING ADMIRAL OF HIS DOMINIONS AND HE HIMSELF WAS INSTALLED KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AT LONDON
3436-172171-0000 WHERE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF ARMS AND CHIVALRY HE WAS ALLOWED NO WEAPON
3436-172171-0001 WHICH WAS THE ONLY THING OF ALL HER LORDES FAIRE GERE THAT HIS MOTHER CARRIED TO THE WOOD WITH HER IN THE USE OF THIS HE BECAME SO SKILFUL THAT HE COULD KILL WITH IT
3436-172171-0002 NOT ONLY THE ANIMALS OF THE CHASE FOR THE TABLE BUT EVEN BIRDS ON THE WING AT LENGTH HOWEVER PERCEVAL WAS ROUSED TO A DESIRE OF MILITARY RENOWN BY SEEING IN THE FOREST FIVE KNIGHTS WHO WERE IN COMPLETE ARMOR
3436-172171-0003 HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER MOTHER WHAT ARE THOSE YONDER THEY ARE ANGELS MY SON SAID SHE BY MY FAITH I WILL GO AND BECOME AN ANGEL WITH THEM AND PERCEVAL WENT TO THE ROAD AND MET THEM
3436-172171-0004 TELL ME GOOD LAD SAID ONE OF THEM SAWEST THOU A KNIGHT PASS THIS WAY EITHER TODAY OR YESTERDAY
3436-172171-0005 SUCH AN ONE AS I AM SAID THE KNIGHT IF THOU WILT TELL ME WHAT I ASK THEE I WILL TELL THEE WHAT THOU ASKEST ME GLADLY WILL I DO SO SAID SIR OWAIN FOR THAT WAS THE KNIGHT'S NAME
3436-172171-0006 AND PERCEVAL IN RETURN GAVE HIM SUCH INFORMATION AS HE HAD THEN PERCEVAL RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND SAID TO HER MOTHER THOSE WERE NOT ANGELS BUT HONORABLE KNIGHTS THEN HIS MOTHER SWOONED AWAY
3436-172171-0007 AND PERCEVAL WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY KEPT THE HORSES THAT CARRIED FIREWOOD AND PROVISIONS FOR THE CASTLE AND HE TOOK A BONY PIEBALD HORSE WHICH SEEMED TO HIM THE STRONGEST OF THEM AND HE PRESSED A PACK INTO THE FORM OF A SADDLE
3436-172171-0008 AND WITH TWISTED TWIGS HE IMITATED THE TRAPPINGS WHICH HE HAD SEEN UPON THE HORSES WHEN HE CAME AGAIN TO HIS MOTHER THE COUNTESS HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON MY SON SAID SHE DESIREST THOU TO RIDE FORTH
3436-172171-0009 YES WITH THY LEAVE SAID HE GO FORWARD THEN SHE SAID TO THE COURT OF ARTHUR WHERE THERE ARE THE BEST AND THE NOBLEST AND THE MOST BOUNTIFUL OF MEN AND TELL HIM THOU ART PERCEVAL THE SON OF PELENORE

3436-172171-0012 PERCEIVING IN ONE CORNER OF THE TENT SOME FOOD TWO FLASKS FULL OF WINE AND SOME BOAR'S FLESH ROASTED HE SAID MY MOTHER TOLD ME WHENEVER I SAW MEAT AND DRINK TO TAKE IT
3436-172171-0013 AND HE ATE GREEDILY FOR HE WAS VERY HUNGRY THE MAIDEN SAID SIR THOU HADST BEST GO QUICKLY FROM HERE FOR FEAR THAT MY FRIENDS SHOULD COME AND EVIL SHOULD BEFALL YOU BUT PERCEVAL SAID
3436-172171-0014 AND HE GAVE THE MAIDEN HIS OWN RING IN EXCHANGE FOR HERS THEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY PERCEVAL JOURNEYED ON TILL HE ARRIVED AT ARTHUR'S COURT AND IT SO HAPPENED
3436-172171-0015 FOR WHEN HER PAGE WAS SERVING THE QUEEN WITH A GOLDEN GOBLET THIS KNIGHT STRUCK THE ARM OF THE PAGE AND DASHED THE WINE IN THE QUEEN'S FACE AND OVER HER STOMACHER THEN HE SAID
3436-172171-0016 LET HIM FOLLOW ME TO THE MEADOW SO THE KNIGHT TOOK HIS HORSE AND RODE TO THE MEADOW CARRYING AWAY THE GOLDEN GOBLET AND ALL THE HOUSEHOLD HUNG DOWN THEIR HEADS AND NO ONE OFFERED TO FOLLOW THE KNIGHT TO TAKE VENGEANCE UPON HIM
3436-172171-0017 FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE VENTURED ON SO DARING AN OUTRAGE UNLESS HE POSSESSED SUCH POWERS THROUGH MAGIC OR CHARMS THAT NONE COULD BE ABLE TO PUNISH HIM JUST THEN BEHOLD
3436-172171-0018 PERCEVAL ENTERED THE HALL UPON THE BONY PIEBALD HORSE WITH HIS UNCOUTH TRAPPINGS IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL STOOD KAY THE SENESCHAL TELL ME TALL MAN SAID PERCEVAL IS THAT ARTHUR YONDER
3436-172171-0019 WHAT WOULDST THOU WITH ARTHUR ASKED KAY MY MOTHER TOLD ME TO GO TO ARTHUR AND RECEIVE KNIGHTHOOD FROM HIM BY MY FAITH SAID HE THOU ART ALL TOO MEANLY EQUIPPED WITH HORSE AND WITH ARMS
3436-172171-0020 THEN ALL THE HOUSEHOLD BEGAN TO JEER AND LAUGH AT HIM BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN DAMSEL WHO HAD BEEN A WHOLE YEAR AT ARTHUR'S COURT
3436-172171-0021 AND THE KING'S FOOL FOOTNOTE A FOOL WAS A COMMON APPENDAGE OF THE COURTS OF THOSE DAYS WHEN THIS ROMANCE WAS WRITTEN A FOOL WAS THE ORNAMENT HELD IN NEXT ESTIMATION TO A DWARF HE WORE A WHITE DRESS WITH A YELLOW BONNET
3436-172171-0022 AND CARRIED A BELL OR BAWBLE IN HIS HAND THOUGH CALLED A FOOL HIS WORDS WERE OFTEN WEIGHED AND REMEMBERED AS IF THERE WERE A SORT OF ORACULAR MEANING IN THEM
3436-172171-0023 TILL SHE HAD SEEN HIM WHO WOULD BE THE FLOWER OF CHIVALRY NOW THIS DAMSEL CAME UP TO PERCEVAL AND TOLD HIM SMILING THAT IF HE LIVED HE WOULD BE ONE OF THE BRAVEST AND BEST OF KNIGHTS TRULY SAID KAY
3436-172171-0024 THOU ART ILL TAUGHT TO REMAIN A YEAR AT ARTHUR'S COURT WITH CHOICE OF SOCIETY AND SMILE ON NO ONE AND NOW BEFORE THE FACE OF ARTHUR AND ALL HIS KNIGHTS TO CALL SUCH A MAN AS THIS THE FLOWER OF KNIGHTHOOD
3436-172171-0025 THAT SHE FELL SENSELESS TO THE GROUND THEN SAID KAY TO PERCEVAL GO AFTER THE KNIGHT WHO WENT HENCE TO THE MEADOW OVERTHROW HIM AND RECOVER THE GOLDEN GOBLET AND POSSESS THYSELF OF HIS HORSE AND ARMS AND THOU SHALT HAVE KNIGHTHOOD
3436-172171-0026 I WILL DO SO TALL MAN SAID PERCEVAL SO HE TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD TOWARD THE MEADOW AND WHEN HE CAME THERE THE KNIGHT WAS RIDING UP AND DOWN PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH AND VALOR AND NOBLE MIEN TELL ME SAID THE KNIGHT

3436-172171-0030 UPON THIS THE KNIGHT RAN AT HIM FURIOUSLY AND STRUCK HIM A VIOLENT BLOW WITH THE SHAFT OF HIS SPEAR
3436-172171-0031 MY MOTHER'S SERVANTS WERE NOT USED TO PLAY WITH ME IN THIS WISE SO THUS WILL I PLAY WITH THEE AND HE THREW AT HIM ONE OF HIS SHARP POINTED STICKS AND IT STRUCK HIM IN THE EYE AND CAME OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD SO THAT HE FELL DOWN LIFELESS
3436-172171-0032 VERILY SAID SIR OWAIN THE SON OF URIEN TO KAY THE SENESCHAL THOU WAST ILL ADVISED TO SEND THAT MADMAN AFTER THE KNIGHT FOR HE MUST EITHER BE OVERTHROWN OR FLEE AND EITHER WAY IT WILL BE A DISGRACE TO ARTHUR AND HIS WARRIORS
3436-172171-0033 THEREFORE WILL I GO TO SEE WHAT HAS BEFALLEN HIM SO SIR OWAIN WENT TO THE MEADOW AND HE FOUND PERCEVAL TRYING IN VAIN TO GET THE DEAD KNIGHT'S ARMOR OFF IN ORDER TO CLOTHE HIMSELF WITH IT
3436-172171-0034 SIR OWAIN UNFASTENED THE ARMOR AND HELPED PERCEVAL TO PUT IT ON AND TAUGHT HIM HOW TO PUT HIS FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND USE THE SPUR
3436-172171-0035 AND URGED ON HIS HORSE WITH A STICK THEN OWAIN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM RETURN TO THE COURT TO RECEIVE THE PRAISE THAT WAS HIS DUE BUT PERCEVAL SAID I WILL NOT COME TO THE COURT TILL I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE TALL MAN THAT IS THERE

3436-172171-0037 WENT BACK TO THE COURT AND RELATED ALL THESE THINGS TO ARTHUR AND GUENEVER AND TO ALL THE HOUSEHOLD
3436-172171-0038 AND HE CAME TO A LAKE ON THE SIDE OF WHICH WAS A FAIR CASTLE AND ON THE BORDER OF THE LAKE HE SAW A HOARY HEADED MAN SITTING UPON A VELVET CUSHION AND HIS ATTENDANTS WERE FISHING IN THE LAKE
3436-172171-0039 WHEN THE HOARY HEADED MAN BEHELD PERCEVAL APPROACHING HE AROSE AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE PERCEVAL RODE TO THE CASTLE AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND HE ENTERED THE HALL
3436-172171-0040 AND THE HOARY HEADED MAN RECEIVED PERCEVAL COURTEOUSLY AND ASKED HIM TO SIT BY HIM ON THE CUSHION WHEN IT WAS TIME THE TABLES WERE SET AND THEY WENT TO MEAT AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR MEAT THE HOARY HEADED MAN ASKED PERCEVAL
3436-172171-0041 IF HE KNEW HOW TO FIGHT WITH THE SWORD I KNOW NOT SAID PERCEVAL BUT WERE I TO BE TAUGHT DOUBTLESS I SHOULD AND THE HOARY HEADED MAN SAID TO HIM I AM THY UNCLE THY MOTHER'S BROTHER I AM CALLED KING PECHEUR

3436-172171-0045 AND WHEN ALL THE COMPANY SAW THIS THEY BEGAN TO WEEP AND LAMENT BUT FOR ALL THAT THE MAN DID NOT BREAK OFF HIS DISCOURSE WITH PERCEVAL AND AS HE DID NOT TELL HIM THE MEANING OF WHAT HE SAW HE FOREBORE TO ASK HIM CONCERNING IT
3436-172171-0046 NOW THE CUP THAT PERCEVAL SAW WAS THE SANGREAL AND THE SPEAR THE SACRED SPEAR AND AFTERWARDS KING PECHEUR REMOVED WITH THOSE SACRED RELICS INTO A FAR COUNTRY ONE EVENING
3436-172171-0047 PERCEVAL ENTERED A VALLEY AND CAME TO A HERMIT'S CELL AND THE HERMIT WELCOMED HIM GLADLY AND THERE HE SPENT THE NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING HE AROSE AND WHEN HE WENT FORTH BEHOLD A SHOWER OF SNOW HAD FALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND A HAWK
3436-172171-0048 HAD KILLED A WILD FOWL IN FRONT OF THE CELL AND THE NOISE OF THE HORSE HAD SCARED THE HAWK AWAY AND A RAVEN ALIGHTED ON THE BIRD AND PERCEVAL STOOD AND COMPARED THE BLACKNESS OF THE RAVEN AND THE WHITENESS OF THE SNOW
3436-172171-0049 TO THE HAIR OF THE LADY THAT BEST HE LOVED WHICH WAS BLACKER THAN JET AND TO HER SKIN WHICH WAS WHITER THAN THE SNOW AND TO THE TWO RED SPOTS UPON HER CHEEKS WHICH WERE REDDER THAN THE BLOOD UPON THE SNOW

3436-172171-0053 AND WHEN THE YOUTH RETURNED TO THE KING AND TOLD HOW RUDELY HE HAD BEEN TREATED SIR KAY SAID I WILL GO MYSELF AND WHEN HE GREETED PERCEVAL AND GOT NO ANSWER HE SPOKE TO HIM RUDELY AND ANGRILY
3436-172171-0054 AND PERCEVAL THRUST AT HIM WITH HIS LANCE AND CAST HIM DOWN SO THAT HE BROKE HIS ARM AND HIS SHOULDER BLADE AND WHILE HE LAY THUS STUNNED HIS HORSE RETURNED BACK AT A WILD AND PRANCING PACE THEN SAID
3436-172171-0055 SURNAMED THE GOLDEN TONGUED BECAUSE HE WAS THE MOST COURTEOUS KNIGHT IN ARTHUR'S COURT IT IS NOT FITTING THAT ANY SHOULD DISTURB AN HONORABLE KNIGHT FROM HIS THOUGHT UNADVISEDLY FOR EITHER HE IS PONDERING SOME DAMAGE THAT HE HAS SUSTAINED
3436-172171-0056 OR HE IS THINKING OF THE LADY WHOM BEST HE LOVES IF IT SEEM WELL TO THEE LORD I WILL GO AND SEE IF THIS KNIGHT HAS CHANGED FROM HIS THOUGHT AND IF HE HAS I WILL ASK HIM COURTEOUSLY TO COME AND VISIT THEE
3436-172171-0057 AND PERCEVAL WAS RESTING ON THE SHAFT OF HIS SPEAR PONDERING THE SAME THOUGHT
3436-172171-0058 IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AS AGREEABLE TO THEE AS IT WOULD BE TO ME I WOULD CONVERSE WITH THEE I HAVE ALSO A MESSAGE FROM ARTHUR UNTO THEE TO PRAY THEE TO COME AND VISIT HIM
3436-172171-0059 AND TWO MEN HAVE BEEN BEFORE ON THIS ERRAND THAT IS TRUE SAID PERCEVAL AND UNCOURTEOUSLY THEY CAME THEY ATTACKED ME AND I WAS ANNOYED THEREAT THEN HE TOLD HIM THE THOUGHT THAT OCCUPIED HIS MIND
3436-172171-0060 AND GAWAIN SAID THIS WAS NOT AN UNGENTLE THOUGHT AND I SHOULD MARVEL IF IT WERE PLEASANT FOR THEE TO BE DRAWN FROM IT THEN SAID PERCEVAL TELL ME IS SIR KAY IN ARTHUR'S COURT

3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0002 AS THE SUN ROSE THE HEAT BECAME INTOLERABLE THE DUST IN PLACES BROUGHT VIVID MEMORIES OF THE TRIP ACROSS THE PLAINS
3830-12535-0003 TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EXPECTED TRAIN
3830-12535-0004 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0005 THAT LASTED UNTIL DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I FOUND WATER ON THE TRAIL TETHERING MY PONY FOR HIS MUCH NEEDED DINNER I OPENED MY SACK OF HARD BREAD TO COUNT THE CONTENTS MY STORE WAS HALF GONE I LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL TREE
3830-12535-0006 NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0008 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM AROUND ABOUT OVER THE PLAIN AND THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH AT A RAPID GAIT FINALLY HE SLACKENED PACE AND I AGAIN BECAME MASTER
3830-12535-0010 ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
3830-12535-0011 A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRAVEL BROUGHT UNEASINESS AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE NOT ON THE REGULAR TRAIL NOT KNOWING BUT THIS WAS SOME CUT OFF I WENT ON UNTIL THE COLUMBIA RIVER BLUFF WAS REACHED AND THE GREAT RIVER WAS IN SIGHT
3830-12535-0012 HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
3830-12535-0013 ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
3830-12535-0014 JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0016 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0017 THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
3830-12535-0018 AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
3830-12535-0019 BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
3830-12535-0020 DETERMINED TO REACH CAMP THAT NIGHT IF I COULD POSSIBLY DO SO
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0022 SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
3830-12535-0023 WHEN WE CAME TO CONSIDER HOW THE PARTY SHOULD PROCEED I ADVISED THE OVER MOUNTAIN TRIP BUT I CAUTIONED THEM TO EXPECT SOME SNOW AND MUCH HARD WORK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEY ASKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS THIS BROUGHT DISAPPOINTMENT
3830-12535-0024 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0025 WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
3830-12535-0026 THAT BESET OUR WAY AT EVERY STEP EVERY MAN LITERALLY PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL WE WERE COMPELLED OFTEN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE WHEELS TO BOOST THE WAGONS OVER THE LOGS OR TO EASE THEM DOWN STEEP PLACES
3830-12535-0027 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0029 TO CUT IT OUT WITH OUR DULLED FLIMSY SAW SEEMED AN ENDLESS TASK DIG DOWN BOYS SAID FATHER AND IN SHORT ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE SHOVEL WAS OUT OF THE WAGONS VERY SOON THE WAY WAS OPEN FULLY FOUR FEET DEEP AND OXEN AND WAGONS PASSED UNDER THE OBSTRUCTION
3830-12535-0030 DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
3830-12535-0031 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0032 WHEN OUR LITTLE TRAIN AT LAST EMERGED FROM THE FORESTS AND CAME OUT INTO THE NISQUALLY PLAINS
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
3830-12530-0000 SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
3830-12530-0001 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0002 UPON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SHORES OF THIS BAY LAY THE TWO TOWNS PORT STEILACOOM AND STEILACOOM CITY BOTH ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE A FAR LARGER TRADE CENTERED HERE THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT ON PUGET SOUND
3830-12530-0003 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0005 WE WERE SORELY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT THE FLATTERING OFFER OF FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FOR COMMON LABOR IN A TIMBER CAMP BUT CONCLUDED NOT TO BE SWERVED FROM THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOMESITE DURING THIS VISIT WE BEGAN SEEING INDIANS IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0007 BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
3830-12530-0008 AMONG THE INDIANS AS AMONG THE WHITES THE WORKERS IT MAY BE SAID ARE LESS NUMEROUS AMONG THE MEN THE WOMEN ARE ALL INDUSTRIOUS SHOULD WE CAMP HERE AND SPY OUT THE LAND OR SHOULD WE GO FORWARD AND SEE WHAT LAY BEFORE US
3830-12530-0009 AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
3830-12530-0010 AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
3830-12530-0011 AND IN A DEAD CALM TO CONTINUE OUR CRUISE OLIVER SOON DROPPED INTO A COMFORTABLE AFTERNOON NAP LEAVING ME IN FULL COMMAND AS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND THE TIDE WAS TAKING US RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO
3830-12530-0012 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0013 IT SURELY CAN'T BE I RESPONDED THREE QUARTERS ASLEEP THAT'S WHAT IT IS HE ASSERTED WE WERE WIDE AWAKE NOW AND GAVE CHASE VERY SOON WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANIMAL AND SUCCEEDED IN THROWING A ROPE OVER ITS HORNS
3830-12530-0014 BY THIS TIME WE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE NARROWS AND WE SOON FOUND WE HAD SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN TO TOW A DEER
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0016 AND WITH CONTENDING FORCES OF CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS YET ALL MOVING IN A GENERAL DIRECTION IT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A GENUINE TIDE RIP THE WATERS BOILED AS IF IN A VERITABLE CALDRON SWELLING UP HERE AND THERE
3830-12530-0017 GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
3830-12530-0018 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0020 AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
3830-12530-0021 AND DRAG OUR CANOE AROUND THE DRIFTS IT WAS A STORY OF CONSTANT TOIL WITH CONSEQUENT DISCOURAGEMENT NOT ENDING UNTIL WE CAMPED
3830-12530-0022 AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
3830-12530-0023 BUT WAGON ROADS THERE WERE NONE AND WHETHER A FEASIBLE ROUTE FOR ONE COULD BE FOUND ONLY TIME AND LABOR COULD DETERMINE WE RETRACED OUR STEPS AND IN THE EVENING LANDED AGAIN AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AFTER A SEVERE DAY'S TOIL WE WERE IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD
3830-12530-0024 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0026 WE HAD FOUND THE LAND BUT WITH CONDITIONS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TOO ADVERSE TO OVERCOME IT WAS A DISCOURAGING OUTLOOK EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ROADS SUCH TIMBER IT SEEMED AN APPALLING UNDERTAKING TO CLEAR THIS LAND
3830-12530-0027 WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
3830-12530-0028 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0029 PASS TRAIL INTO WASHINGTON THEY LOCATED IN A BODY OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE VALLEY AND BEFORE THE YEAR WAS ENDED HAD MADE A ROUGH WAGON ROAD OUT TO THE PRAIRIES
3830-12530-0030 LEST SOME SMART FELLOW SHOULD UP AND SAY I WAS DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION I AM NOT WHEN WE HAD BROKEN CAMP AND WERE SAILING ALONG WE HEARD A DULL SOUND LIKE THAT OFTEN HEARD
3830-12530-0031 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0032 WHILE MILLIONS WERE SEEMINGLY DANCING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR LEAPING IN THE AIR WE COULD FEEL THE FISH STRIKING AGAINST THE BOAT IN SUCH VAST NUMBERS THAT THEY FAIRLY MOVED IT THE LEAP IN THE AIR WAS SO HIGH
3830-12530-0033 ONE WOULD DROP INTO THE BOAT WE SOON DISCOVERED SOME INDIANS FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL
3830-12530-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0035 AND REACHED THE ISLAND SHORE IN SAFETY ONLY TO BECOME WEATHER BOUND IN THE WILDS ONCE MORE THIS CAMP DID NOT PROVE SO DREARY AS THE LAST ONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS MORE EXPOSED TO THE SWELL OF THE BIG WATERS
3830-12530-0036 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0038 THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TOWN LIKE THE LOST HUNTERS WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ANY PLACE ELSE WAS NOT LOST OURSELVES THE WORLD WAS LOST FROM US THREE SHIPS PASSED US WHILE WE WERE AT THIS CAMP
3830-12530-0039 A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0041 MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
3830-12530-0042 IN A DEBAUCH THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THEIR MONEY HELD OUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A MORE STALWART RACE OF INDIANS THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH DOUBTLESS FROM THE BUFFETING RECEIVED IN THE LARGER WATERS THEY WOULD OFTEN GO OUT EVEN TO THE OPEN SEA
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0044 THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE LITTLE NEW VILLAGE AND THE ACTIVITY THAT WE SAW THERE GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE WATERS OF THE SOUND MOST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WOULD GO ON TO THE LITTLE CABIN ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER THREE DAYS SUFFICED TO LAND
3830-12530-0045 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0000 CAN I GET HOME TONIGHT I ASKED MYSELF IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE SUN WAS YET HIGH I WAS WELL UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE COWLITZ RIVER HOW FAR I COULD NOT TELL
3830-12531-0001 FOR THERE WERE NO MILESTONES ON THE CROOKED HALF OBSTRUCTED TRAIL LEADING DOWNSTREAM AT BEST IT WOULD BE A RACE WITH THE SUN BUT THE DAYS WERE LONG AND THE TWILIGHT WAS LONG
3830-12531-0002 I WORE A HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRT A SLOUCH HAT AND WORN SHOES BOTH HAT AND SHOES GAVE AMPLE VENTILATION SOCKS I HAD NONE NEITHER HAD I SUSPENDERS AN IMPROVISED BELT
3830-12531-0003 TAKING THEIR PLACE I WAS DRESSED FOR THE RACE AND WAS EAGER FOR THE TRIAL AT OLYMPIA I HAD PARTED WITH MY BROTHER
3830-12531-0004 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0005 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
3830-12531-0006 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0007 I DO NOT LOOK UPON THOSE YEARS OF CAMP AND CABIN LIFE AS YEARS OF HARDSHIP TO BE SURE OUR FOOD WAS PLAIN AS WELL AS OUR DRESS OUR HOURS OF LABOR WERE LONG AND THE LABOR ITSELF WAS FREQUENTLY SEVERE THE PIONEERS APPEARED ROUGH AND UNCOUTH
3830-12531-0008 WE NEVER WATCHED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN
3830-12531-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0010 AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0013 WHERE DO THEY GET THE MONEY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MONEY SOME TAKE IT THERE WITH THEM MEN WORKING IN THE TIMBER CAMPS GET FOUR DOLLARS A DAY AND THEIR BOARD AT ONE PLACE THEY PAID FOUR DOLLARS A CORD FOR WOOD TO SHIP TO SAN FRANCISCO
3830-12531-0014 AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
3830-12531-0015 OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
3830-12531-0016 NOW I FOUND MYSELF PRAISING A COUNTRY FOR THE AGRICULTURAL QUALITIES OF WHICH I COULD NOT SAY MUCH BUT IF WE COULD SELL PRODUCE HIGHER MIGHT WE NOT WELL LOWER OUR STANDARD OF AN IDEAL FARM THE CLAIM I HAD TAKEN WAS DESCRIBED WITH A TOUCH OF APOLOGY
3830-12531-0017 HOWEVER WE DECIDED TO MOVE AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY THE WIFE BABY BEDDING OX YOKE AND LOG CHAIN WERE SENT UP THE COWLITZ IN A CANOE BUCK AND DANDY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0018 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0019 HARD BREAD'S AN ODD NAME FOR A HOTEL WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE THE OLD WIDOWER THAT KEPT THE PLACE FED HIS PATRONS ON HARDTACK THREE TIMES A DAY I FOUND THAT MY WIFE HAD NOT FARED ANY BETTER THAN I HAD ON THE TRAIL AND IN FACT
3830-12531-0020 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0022 WE SOON ARRIVED AT THE COWLITZ LANDING THE END OF THE CANOE JOURNEY STRIKING THE TENT THAT HAD SERVED US SO WELL ON THE PLAINS AND MAKING A CHEERFUL CAMP FIRE WE SPEEDILY FORGOT THE HARD EXPERIENCES OF THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0023 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0024 OUR COWS WERE GONE GIVEN FOR PROVENDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE OXEN DURING THE DEEP DECEMBER SNOW SO WHEN WE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK WE HAD THE BABY BUCK AND DANDY A TENT AN OX YOKE AND CHAIN ENOUGH CLOTHING AND BEDDING TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE
3830-12531-0025 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12531-0026 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0028 THE DREAD DISEASE HAD TERRORS THEN THAT IT DOES NOT NOW POSSESS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE MY FOLKS HAD BEEN TAKEN SICK
3830-12531-0029 IT APPEARED THAT I HAD SCARCELY GOT OUT OF SIGHT ON MY TRIP BACK WITH THE OXEN BEFORE ONE OF THOSE ROYAL PIONEER MATRONS HAD COME TO THE CAMP SHE PLEADED AND INSISTED AND FINALLY ALMOST FRIGHTENED THE LITTLE WIFE INTO GOING WITH HER
3830-12531-0030 AND SHARING HER HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR BY
3830-12531-0031 FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
6437-66173-0000 CHAPTER TEN I FIGHT CONWAY THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER WHO CHERISHED A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE CENTIPEDES HAD HAD A HAND IN THE BUSINESS AND THAT PERSON WAS CONWAY
6437-66173-0001 HIS RED HAIR SEEMED TO CHANGE TO A LIVELIER RED AND HIS SALLOW CHEEKS TO A DEEPER SALLOW AS WE GLANCED AT HIM STEALTHILY OVER THE TOPS OF OUR SLATES THE NEXT DAY IN SCHOOL HE KNEW WE WERE WATCHING HIM AND MADE SUNDRY MOUTHS
6437-66173-0002 AND SCOWLED IN THE MOST THREATENING WAY OVER HIS SUMS CONWAY HAD AN ACCOMPLISHMENT PECULIARLY HIS OWN THAT OF THROWING HIS THUMBS OUT OF JOINT AT WILL SOMETIMES WHILE ABSORBED IN STUDY OR ON BECOMING NERVOUS AT RECITATION
6437-66173-0003 HE PERFORMED THE FEAT UNCONSCIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE MORNING HIS THUMBS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN A CHRONIC STATE OF DISLOCATION INDICATING GREAT MENTAL AGITATION ON THE PART OF THE OWNER WE FULLY EXPECTED AN OUTBREAK FROM HIM AT RECESS
6437-66173-0004 BUT THE INTERMISSION PASSED OFF TRANQUILLY SOMEWHAT TO OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE AFTERNOON SESSION IT HAPPENED THAT BINNY WALLACE AND MYSELF HAVING GOT SWAMPED IN OUR LATIN EXERCISE
6437-66173-0005 WERE DETAINED IN SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING OUR MEMORIES WITH A PAGE OF MISTER ANDREWS'S PERPLEXING IRREGULAR VERBS BINNY WALLACE FINISHING HIS TASK FIRST WAS DISMISSED I FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER
6437-66173-0006 AND ON STEPPING INTO THE PLAYGROUND SAW MY LITTLE FRIEND PLASTERED AS IT WERE UP AGAINST THE FENCE AND CONWAY STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM READY TO DELIVER A BLOW ON THE UPTURNED UNPROTECTED FACE WHOSE GENTLENESS WOULD HAVE STAYED ANY ARM BUT A COWARD'S
6437-66173-0007 BUT ON SEEING ME SWEEP ACROSS THE YARD WHIRLING MY STRAP OF BOOKS IN THE AIR LIKE A SLING HE CALLED OUT LUSTILY LAY LOW CONWAY HERE'S YOUNG BAILEY CONWAY TURNED JUST IN TIME TO CATCH ON HIS SHOULDER THE BLOW INTENDED FOR HIS HEAD
6437-66173-0008 HE REACHED FORWARD ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS HE HAD ARMS LIKE A WINDMILL THAT BOY AND GRASPING ME BY THE HAIR TORE OUT QUITE A RESPECTABLE HANDFUL THE TEARS FLEW TO MY EYES
6437-66173-0009 BUT THEY WERE NOT THE TEARS OF DEFEAT THEY WERE MERELY THE INVOLUNTARY TRIBUTE WHICH NATURE PAID TO THE DEPARTED TRESSES IN A SECOND MY LITTLE JACKET LAY ON THE GROUND AND I STOOD ON GUARD RESTING LIGHTLY ON MY RIGHT LEG
6437-66173-0010 AND KEEPING MY EYE FIXED STEADILY ON CONWAY'S IN ALL OF WHICH I WAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF PHIL ADAMS WHOSE FATHER SUBSCRIBED TO A SPORTING JOURNAL CONWAY ALSO THREW HIMSELF INTO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE
6437-66173-0011 AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
6437-66173-0012 IT WAS A CUSTOM WITH THE LARGER PUPILS TO RETURN TO THE PLAYGROUND AFTER SCHOOL AND PLAY BASEBALL UNTIL SUNDOWN THE TOWN AUTHORITIES HAD PROHIBITED BALL PLAYING ON THE SQUARE AND THERE BEING NO OTHER AVAILABLE PLACE
6437-66173-0013 THE BOYS FELL BACK PERFORCE ON THE SCHOOL YARD JUST AT THIS CRISIS A DOZEN OR SO OF THE TEMPLARS ENTERED THE GATE AND SEEING AT A GLANCE THE BELLIGERENT STATUS OF CONWAY AND MYSELF DROPPED BAT AND BALL AND RUSHED TO THE SPOT WHERE WE STOOD
6437-66173-0014 IS IT A FIGHT ASKED PHIL ADAMS WHO SAW BY OUR FRESHNESS THAT WE HAD NOT YET GOT TO WORK YES IT'S A FIGHT I ANSWERED UNLESS CONWAY WILL ASK WALLACE'S PARDON PROMISE NEVER TO HECTOR ME IN FUTURE
6437-66173-0015 AND PUT BACK MY HAIR THIS LAST CONDITION WAS RATHER A STAGGERER I SHA'N'T DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID CONWAY SULKILY THEN THE THING MUST GO ON SAID ADAMS WITH DIGNITY
6437-66173-0016 RODGERS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS YOUR SECOND CONWAY BAILEY COME HERE WHAT'S THE ROW ABOUT HE WAS THRASHING BINNY WALLACE NO I WASN'T INTERRUPTED CONWAY
6437-66173-0017 BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
6437-66173-0018 COOL IS THE WORD SAID ADAMS AS HE BOUND A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND MY HEAD AND CAREFULLY TUCKED AWAY THE LONG STRAGGLING LOCKS THAT OFFERED A TEMPTING ADVANTAGE TO THE ENEMY WHO EVER HEARD OF A FELLOW WITH SUCH A HEAD OF HAIR GOING INTO ACTION
6437-66173-0019 MUTTERED PHIL TWITCHING THE HANDKERCHIEF TO ASCERTAIN IF IT WERE SECURELY TIED HE THEN LOOSENED MY GALLOWSES BRACES AND BUCKLED THEM TIGHTLY ABOVE MY HIPS NOW THEN BANTAM NEVER SAY DIE
6437-66173-0020 CONWAY REGARDED THESE BUSINESS LIKE PREPARATIONS WITH EVIDENT MISGIVING FOR HE CALLED RODGERS TO HIS SIDE AND HAD HIMSELF ARRAYED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS CROPPED SO CLOSE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF IT WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS
6437-66173-0021 IS YOUR MAN READY ASKED PHIL ADAMS ADDRESSING RODGERS READY KEEP YOUR BACK TO THE GATE TOM
6437-66173-0022 AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SUN IN HIS EYES BEHOLD US ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE LIKE DAVID AND THE PHILISTINE LOOK AT US AS LONG AS YOU MAY FOR THIS IS ALL YOU SHALL SEE OF THE COMBAT
6437-66173-0023 ACCORDING TO MY THINKING THE HOSPITAL TEACHES A BETTER LESSON THAN THE BATTLE FIELD I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY BLACK EYE AND MY SWOLLEN LIP IF YOU WILL BUT NOT A WORD OF THE FIGHT
6437-66173-0024 YOU'LL GET NO DESCRIPTION OF IT FROM ME SIMPLY BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD PROVE VERY POOR READING AND NOT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MY REVOLT AGAINST CONWAY'S TYRANNY UNJUSTIFIABLE I HAD BORNE CONWAY'S PERSECUTIONS FOR MANY MONTHS WITH LAMB LIKE PATIENCE
6437-66173-0025 I MIGHT HAVE SHIELDED MYSELF BY APPEALING TO MISTER GRIMSHAW BUT NO BOY IN THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL COULD DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING CASTE WHETHER THIS WAS JUST OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER A PIN SINCE IT WAS SO A TRADITIONARY LAW OF THE PLACE
6437-66173-0026 THE PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE I SUFFERED FROM MY TORMENTOR WAS NOTHING TO THE PAIN HE INFLICTED ON ME INDIRECTLY BY HIS PERSISTENT CRUELTY TO LITTLE BINNY WALLACE I SHOULD HAVE LACKED THE SPIRIT OF A HEN IF I HAD NOT RESENTED IT FINALLY
6437-66173-0027 I AM GLAD THAT I FACED CONWAY AND ASKED NO FAVORS AND GOT RID OF HIM FOREVER I AM GLAD THAT PHIL ADAMS TAUGHT ME TO BOX AND I SAY TO ALL YOUNGSTERS LEARN TO BOX TO RIDE TO PULL AN OAR AND TO SWIM
6437-66173-0028 THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
6437-66173-0029 EVER WRITTEN FOR BOYS ARE THESE WORDS LEARN TO BOX THEN AS YOU LEARN TO PLAY CRICKET AND FOOTBALL NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WORSE BUT VERY MUCH THE BETTER FOR LEARNING TO BOX WELL
6437-66173-0030 THAT YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO TO A CHALLENGE TO FIGHT SAY NO IF YOU CAN ONLY TAKE CARE YOU MAKE IT PLAIN TO YOURSELF WHY YOU SAY NO IT'S A PROOF OF THE HIGHEST COURAGE IF DONE FROM TRUE CHRISTIAN MOTIVES
6437-66173-0031 IT'S QUITE RIGHT AND JUSTIFIABLE IF DONE FROM A SIMPLE AVERSION TO PHYSICAL PAIN AND DANGER BUT DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU FEAR A LICKING AND SAY OR THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU FEAR GOD FOR THAT'S NEITHER CHRISTIAN NOR HONEST AND IF YOU DO FIGHT
6437-66173-0032 FIGHT IT OUT AND DON'T GIVE IN WHILE YOU CAN STAND AND SEE AND DON'T GIVE IN WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE FOR I COULD STAND VERY LITTLE AND SEE NOT AT ALL HAVING POMMELLED THE SCHOOL PUMP FOR THE LAST TWENTY SECONDS
6437-66173-0033 WHEN CONWAY RETIRED FROM THE FIELD AS PHIL ADAMS STEPPED UP TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME HE RECEIVED A TELLING BLOW IN THE STOMACH FOR ALL THE FIGHT WAS NOT OUT OF ME YET AND I MISTOOK HIM FOR A NEW ADVERSARY
6437-66173-0034 CONVINCED OF MY ERROR I ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BOYS BLANDLY AND BLINDLY I REMEMBER THAT BINNY WALLACE WANTED TO GIVE ME HIS SILVER PENCIL CASE
6437-66173-0035 THE GENTLE SOUL HAD STOOD THROUGHOUT THE CONTEST WITH HIS FACE TURNED TO THE FENCE SUFFERING UNTOLD AGONY
6437-66173-0036 ESCORTED BY TWO OR THREE OF THE SCHOOLFELLOWS I WALKED HOME THROUGH THE PLEASANT AUTUMN TWILIGHT BATTERED BUT TRIUMPHANT AS I WENT ALONG MY CAP COCKED ON ONE SIDE TO KEEP THE CHILLY AIR FROM MY EYE
6437-66173-0037 I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
6437-66173-0038 I COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS IS VICTORY HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER FELLOW TOM SAID HARRY BLAKE HESITATING WELL
6437-66173-0039 DID YOU SEE MISTER GRIMSHAW LOOKING OUT OF THE RECITATION ROOM WINDOW JUST AS WE LEFT THE YARD NO WAS HE THOUGH I AM SURE OF IT
6437-66173-0040 SHOULDN'T WONDER NO HE DIDN'T BROKE IN ADAMS OR HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHORT METRE
6437-66173-0041 WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
6437-66173-0042 MISS ABIGAIL OPENING THE FRONT DOOR STARTED BACK AT MY HILARIOUS APPEARANCE I TRIED TO SMILE UPON HER SWEETLY BUT THE SMILE RIPPLING OVER MY SWOLLEN CHEEK AND DYING AWAY LIKE A SPENT WAVE ON MY NOSE
6437-66173-0043 PRODUCED AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH MISS ABIGAIL DECLARED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE LIKE EXCEPTING ON THE FACE OF A CHINESE IDOL SHE HUSTLED ME UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO THE PRESENCE OF MY GRANDFATHER IN THE SITTING ROOM
6437-66173-0044 CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
6437-66173-0045 FOR THE CAPTAIN WAS WELL AWARE OF THE LONG CONTINUED PROVOCATION I HAD ENDURED AH YOU RASCAL CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN AFTER HEARING MY STORY JUST LIKE ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG ALWAYS IN ONE KIND OF TROUBLE OR ANOTHER
6437-66173-0046 I BELIEVE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY I THINK SAID MISS ABIGAIL WITHOUT THE FAINTEST EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE THAT A TABLE SPOONFUL OF HOT DRO THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTED MISS ABIGAIL PEREMPTORILY
6437-66173-0047 DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
6437-66173-0048 THEY'LL BE HANDY TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE SAYS MISS ABIGAIL GRIMLY OF COURSE SO GREAT A BREACH OF DISCIPLINE WAS NOT TO BE PASSED OVER BY MISTER GRIMSHAW
6437-66173-0049 HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
6437-66173-0050 AS THE READER IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE LEADING POINTS IN THE CASE OF BAILEY VERSUS CONWAY I SHALL NOT REPORT THE TRIAL FURTHER THAN TO SAY THAT ADAMS MARDEN AND SEVERAL OTHER PUPILS TESTIFIED TO THE FACT
6437-66173-0051 THAT CONWAY HAD IMPOSED ON ME EVER SINCE MY FIRST DAY AT THE TEMPLE SCHOOL THEIR EVIDENCE ALSO WENT TO SHOW THAT CONWAY WAS A QUARRELSOME CHARACTER GENERALLY BAD FOR CONWAY SETH RODGERS ON THE PART OF HIS FRIEND
6437-66173-0052 PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
6437-66173-0053 I AM THE BOY TO BE BLAMED FOR I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE THIS DREW OUT THE STORY OF CONWAY'S HARSH TREATMENT OF THE SMALLER BOYS AS BINNY RELATED THE WRONGS OF HIS PLAYFELLOWS SAYING VERY LITTLE OF HIS OWN GRIEVANCES
6437-66173-0054 I NOTICED THAT MISTER GRIMSHAW'S HAND UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF PERHAPS RESTED LIGHTLY FROM TIME TO TIME ON WALLACE'S SUNNY HAIR THE EXAMINATION FINISHED MISTER GRIMSHAW LEANED ON THE DESK THOUGHTFULLY FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
6437-66173-0055 EVERY BOY IN THIS SCHOOL KNOWS THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT IF ONE BOY MALTREATS ANOTHER WITHIN SCHOOL BOUNDS OR WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS THAT IS A MATTER FOR ME TO SETTLE THE CASE SHOULD BE LAID BEFORE ME
6437-66173-0056 I DISAPPROVE OF TALE BEARING I NEVER ENCOURAGE IT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT WHEN ONE PUPIL SYSTEMATICALLY PERSECUTES A SCHOOLMATE IT IS THE DUTY OF SOME HEAD BOY TO INFORM ME NO PUPIL HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS
6437-66173-0057 IF THERE IS ANY FIGHTING TO BE DONE I AM THE PERSON TO BE CONSULTED I DISAPPROVE OF BOYS FIGHTING IT IS UNNECESSARY AND UNCHRISTIAN IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I CONSIDER EVERY LARGE BOY IN THIS SCHOOL AT FAULT
6437-66173-0058 BUT AS THE OFFENCE IS ONE OF OMISSION RATHER THAN COMMISSION MY PUNISHMENT MUST REST ONLY ON THE TWO BOYS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR CONWAY LOSES HIS RECESS FOR A MONTH AND BAILEY HAS A PAGE ADDED TO HIS LATIN LESSONS FOR THE NEXT FOUR RECITATIONS
6437-66173-0059 I NOW REQUEST BAILEY AND CONWAY TO SHAKE HANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR REGRET AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED CONWAY AND I APPROACHED EACH OTHER SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AS IF WE WERE BENT UPON ANOTHER HOSTILE COLLISION
6437-66173-0060 WE CLASPED HANDS IN THE TAMEST MANNER IMAGINABLE AND CONWAY MUMBLED I'M SORRY I FOUGHT WITH YOU I THINK YOU ARE I REPLIED DRILY AND I'M SORRY I HAD TO THRASH YOU
6437-66173-0061 YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SEATS SAID MISTER GRIMSHAW TURNING HIS FACE ASIDE TO HIDE A SMILE I AM SURE MY APOLOGY WAS A VERY GOOD ONE I NEVER HAD ANY MORE TROUBLE WITH CONWAY
6437-66173-0062 HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
3879-174923-0000 THAT HE SHOULD BE ELECTED AND NOW HE DID THINK IT PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD GET THE SEAT ON A PETITION A SCRUTINY USED TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW MADE AS THE SCRUTINY WOULD BE IN THE BOROUGH ITSELF
3879-174923-0001 IT WOULD COST BUT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE SHOULD HE BE SUCCESSFUL WOULD FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH SHOULD HE KNOCK OFF EIGHT VOTES AND LOSE NONE HIMSELF HE WOULD BE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0002 HE KNEW THAT MANY VOTES HAD BEEN GIVEN FOR BROWBOROUGH WHICH IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN OF THEM WOULD BE KNOCKED OFF AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF ANY ONE OF THOSE BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
3879-174923-0003 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE JUDGE BY WHOM ALL THIS WOULD BE DECIDED MIGHT NOT REACH TANKERVILLE IN HIS TRAVELS TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS PERHAPS NOT TILL AFTER EASTER AND IN THE MEANTIME WHAT SHOULD HE DO WITH HIMSELF
3879-174923-0004 AS FOR GOING BACK TO DUBLIN THAT WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION HE HAD ENTERED UPON A FEVERISH STATE OF EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN IRELAND
3879-174923-0005 HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
3879-174923-0006 HE WOULD NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO THINK HOW HE MIGHT IN SUCH CASE BEST BESTOW HIMSELF FOR THE PRESENT HE WOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE REGION OF POLITICS AND LIVE AS NEAR AS HE COULD TO THE WHIRL OF THE WHEEL OF WHICH THE SOUND WAS SO DEAR TO HIM
3879-174923-0007 SO YOU'RE AT THE OLD GAME MISTER FINN SAID HIS LANDLORD YES AT THE OLD GAME I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SAME WITH YOU NOW MISTER BUNCE HAD BEEN A VERY VIOLENT POLITICIAN
3879-174923-0008 PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MISTER FINN I DON'T SEE THAT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY TELL ME AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE THAT THE LORDS HAVE HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION AS WITH ANY THAT EVER WENT BEFORE IT
3879-174923-0009 PERHAPS THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE I THOUGHT MISTER SLIDE AND THE PEOPLE'S BANNER HAD GONE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE BUNCE MISTER SLIDE IS PRETTY WIDE AWAKE WHATEVER SIDE HE'S ON
3879-174923-0010 NOT BUT WHAT HE'S DISGRACED HIMSELF BY WHAT HE'S BEEN AND DONE NOW MISTER SLIDE IN FORMER DAYS HAD BEEN THE EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER
3879-174923-0011 BUT WHAT A MAN KEEPS IN THE WAY OF RELIGION FOR HIS OWN USE IS NEVER NOTHING TO ME AS WHAT I KEEPS IS NOTHING TO HIM I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T KEEP MUCH MISTER BUNCE AND THAT'S NOTHING TO YOU NEITHER IS IT SIR NO INDEED
3879-174923-0012 BUT WHEN WE READ OF CHURCHES AS IS CALLED STATE CHURCHES CHURCHES AS HAVE BISHOPS YOU AND I HAVE TO PAY FOR AS NEVER GOES INTO THEM BUT WE DON'T PAY THE BISHOPS MISTER BUNCE OH YES WE DO BECAUSE IF THEY WASN'T PAID
3879-174923-0013 THE MONEY WOULD COME TO US TO DO AS WE PLEASED WITH IT WE PROVED ALL THAT WHEN WE PARED THEM DOWN A BIT WHAT'S AN ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR A BOX TO PUT THE MONEY INTO TILL YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUT AGAIN
3879-174923-0014 JUST AS THE THEATRES ARE MISTER FINN OR THE GIN SHOPS THEN I KNOW THERE'S A DEAL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE HONEST MEN CAN COME BY THEIR OWN YOU'RE RIGHT ENOUGH MISTER FINN YOU ARE AS FAR AS CHURCHES GO AND YOU WAS RIGHT TOO WHEN YOU CUT AND RUN OFF THE TREASURY BENCH
3879-174923-0015 I NEVER EXPECTED THIS BUT I'LL DO FOR YOU MISTER FINN JUST AS I EVER DID IN THE OLD DAYS AND IT WAS I THAT WAS SORRY WHEN I HEARD OF THE POOR YOUNG LADY'S DEATH SO I WAS MISTER FINN WELL THEN I WON'T MENTION HER NAME NEVER AGAIN
3879-174923-0016 BUT AFTER ALL THERE'S BEEN BETWIXT YOU AND US IT WOULDN'T BE NATURAL TO PASS IT BY WITHOUT ONE WORD WOULD IT MISTER FINN WELL YES HE'S JUST THE SAME MAN AS EVER
3879-174923-0017 JUST AS HE USED TO DO AND NEVER GOT SO MUCH OUT OF IT
3879-174923-0018 THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT WELL YES THAT IS TRUE MISTER FINN THERE NEVER WAS A MAN BETTER AT BRINGING HOME HIS MONEY TO HIS WIFE THAN BUNCE
3879-174923-0019 IF HE'D DRINK IT WHICH HE NEVER DOES I THINK I'D BEAR IT BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO THAT NASTY UNION AND YOUNG JACK WRITES AS WELL AS HIS FATHER PRETTY NIGH MISTER FINN WHICH IS A COMFORT MISTER BUNCE WAS A JOURNEYMAN SCRIVENER AT A LAW STATIONER'S
3879-174923-0020 AND KEEPS HIS SELF BUT HE DON'T BRING HOME HIS MONEY NOR YET IT CAN'T BE EXPECTED MISTER FINN I KNOW WHAT THE YOUNG UNS WILL DO AND WHAT THEY WON'T AND MARY JANE IS QUITE HANDY ABOUT THE HOUSE NOW ONLY SHE DO BREAK THINGS
3879-174923-0021 WHICH HE USED TO KNOW SO WELL A HUNDRED MEMORIES OF FORMER DAYS CROWDED BACK UPON HIM LORD CHILTERN FOR A FEW MONTHS HAD LIVED WITH HIM AND THEN THERE HAD ARISEN A QUARREL WHICH HE HAD FOR A TIME THOUGHT WOULD DISSOLVE HIS OLD LIFE INTO RUIN
3879-174923-0022 NOW LORD CHILTERN WAS AGAIN HIS VERY INTIMATE FRIEND AND THERE HAD USED TO SIT A NEEDY MONEY LENDER WHOM
3879-174923-0023 ALAS ALAS HOW SOON MIGHT HE NOW REQUIRE THAT MONEY LENDER'S SERVICES AND THEN HE RECOLLECTED HOW HE HAD LEFT THESE ROOMS TO GO INTO OTHERS GRANDER AND MORE APPROPRIATE TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE HAD FILLED HIGH OFFICE UNDER THE STATE
3879-174923-0024 WOULD THERE EVER AGAIN COME TO HIM SUCH CAUSE FOR MIGRATION AND WOULD HE AGAIN BE ABLE TO LOAD THE FRAME OF THE LOOKING GLASS OVER THE FIRE WITH COUNTLESS CARDS FROM COUNTESSES AND MINISTERS WIVES HE HAD OPENED THE OYSTER FOR HIMSELF ONCE
3879-174923-0025 WHEN THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN WOULD HE BE ABLE TO INSERT THE POINT AGAIN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DIFFICULT SHELLS WOULD THE COUNTESSES ONCE MORE BE KIND TO HIM WOULD DRAWING ROOMS BE OPENED TO HIM AND SOMETIMES OPENED TO HIM AND TO NO OTHER
3879-174923-0026 THEN HE THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS IN WHICH WONDERFUL THINGS HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM SINCE THAT HE HAD BEEN A MARRIED MAN AND THOSE SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS AND THOSE WONDERFUL WORDS HAD IN NO DEGREE ACTUATED HIM IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE
3879-174923-0027 HE HAD LEFT ALL THOSE THINGS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL AS THOUGH TELLING HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY OFFERED TO HIM BUT WAS HE SURE THAT HE HAD FOUND IT TO BE BETTER HE HAD CERTAINLY SIGHED FOR THE GAUDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT
3879-174923-0028 WHILE HIS YOUNG WIFE WAS LIVING HE HAD KEPT HIS SIGHS DOWN SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HEAR THEM BUT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS NEW LIFE HAD BEEN VAPID AND FLAVOURLESS NOW HE HAD BEEN TEMPTED BACK AGAIN TO THE OLD HAUNTS
3879-174923-0029 WOULD THE COUNTESSES CARDS BE SHOWERED UPON HIM AGAIN ONE CARD OR RATHER NOTE HAD REACHED HIM WHILE HE WAS YET AT TANKERVILLE REMINDING HIM OF OLD DAYS IT WAS FROM MISSUS LOW THE WIFE OF THE BARRISTER
3879-174923-0030 WITH WHOM HE HAD WORKED WHEN HE HAD BEEN A LAW STUDENT IN LONDON SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH THEM AFTER THE OLD FASHION IN BAKER STREET NAMING A DAY AS TO WHICH SHE PRESUMED THAT HE WOULD BY THAT TIME HAVE FINISHED HIS AFFAIRS AT TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0031 INTIMATING ALSO THAT MISTER LOW WOULD THEN HAVE FINISHED HIS AT NORTH BROUGHTON NOW MISTER LOW HAD SAT FOR NORTH BROUGHTON BEFORE PHINEAS LEFT LONDON AND HIS WIFE SPOKE OF THE SEAT AS A CERTAINTY
3879-174923-0032 PHINEAS COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM FEELING THAT MISSUS LOW INTENDED TO TRIUMPH OVER HIM BUT NEVERTHELESS HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION THEY WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM EXPLAINING THAT
3879-174923-0033 AS NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOWN NOBODY HAD BEEN ASKED TO MEET HIM IN FORMER DAYS HE HAD BEEN VERY INTIMATE IN THAT HOUSE HAVING RECEIVED FROM BOTH OF THEM MUCH KINDNESS MINGLED PERHAPS WITH SOME TOUCH OF SEVERITY ON THE PART OF THE LADY
3879-174923-0034 BUT THE GROUND FOR THAT WAS GONE AND MISSUS LOW WAS NO LONGER PAINFULLY SEVERE A FEW WORDS WERE SAID AS TO HIS GREAT LOSS MISSUS LOW ONCE RAISED HER EYEBROWS IN PRETENDED SURPRISE
3879-174923-0035 WHEN PHINEAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD THROWN UP HIS PLACE AND THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN ON THE QUESTION OF THE DAY AND SO SAID MISSUS LOW YOU'VE BEGUN TO ATTACK THE CHURCH IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THIS MOMENT MISTER DAUBENY
3879-174923-0036 AND IF HER HUSBAND COULD NOT BE SAID TO LIVE BY MEANS OF THE SAME ATMOSPHERE IT WAS BECAUSE THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS HAD BEEN DRAWN CHIEFLY IN THE VICE CHANCELLOR'S COURT IN LINCOLN'S INN BUT HE NO DOUBT
3879-174923-0037 WOULD BE VERY MUCH DISTURBED INDEED SHOULD HE EVER BE TOLD THAT HE WAS REQUIRED AS AN EXPECTANT MEMBER OF MISTER DAUBENY'S PARTY TO VOTE FOR THE DISESTABLISHMENT
3879-174923-0038 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT I AM GUILTY OF THROWING THE FIRST STONE SAID PHINEAS THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT THE TEMPLE SINCE FIRST IT WAS BUILT SAID MISSUS LOW WITH ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF ITS POLISHED SHAFTS IN DUST AND FRAGMENTS
3879-174923-0039 I AM AFRAID THAT MISSUS LOW WHEN SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO SPEAK THUS ENERGETICALLY ENTERTAINED SOME CONFUSED IDEA THAT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION WERE ONE AND THE SAME THING OR AT LEAST THAT THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD TOGETHER
3879-174923-0040 YOU HAVEN'T THROWN THE FIRST STONE SAID MISTER LOW BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN UP THE THROWING AT THE FIRST MOMENT IN WHICH STONES MAY BE DANGEROUS NO STONES CAN BE DANGEROUS SAID MISSUS LOW
3879-174923-0041 THE IDEA OF A STATE CHURCH SAID PHINEAS IS OPPOSED TO MY THEORY OF POLITICAL PROGRESS WHAT I HOPE IS THAT MY FRIENDS WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT I ATTACK THE PROTESTANT CHURCH BECAUSE I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC IF I WERE A PRIEST
3879-174923-0042 IT WOULD BE MY BUSINESS TO DO SO BUT I AM NOT A PRIEST MISTER LOW GAVE HIS OLD FRIEND A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND IN ALL FRIENDLY OBSERVANCES TREATED HIM WITH DUE AFFECTION BUT NEITHER DID HE NOR DID HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0043 FOR A MOMENT ABSTAIN FROM ATTACKING THEIR GUEST IN RESPECT TO HIS SPEECHES AT TANKERVILLE IT SEEMED INDEED TO PHINEAS THAT AS MISSUS LOW WAS BUCKLED UP IN SUCH TRIPLE ARMOUR THAT SHE FEARED NOTHING
3879-174923-0044 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS LOUD IN EXPRESSING HER ABHORRENCE OF THE ENEMIES OF THE CHURCH IF SHE FEARED NOTHING WHY SHOULD SHE SCREAM SO LOUDLY BETWEEN THE TWO HE WAS A GOOD DEAL CRUSHED AND CONFOUNDED
3879-174923-0045 AND MISSUS LOW WAS VERY TRIUMPHANT WHEN SHE ALLOWED HIM TO ESCAPE FROM HER HANDS AT TEN O'CLOCK BUT AT THAT MOMENT NOTHING HAD AS YET BEEN HEARD IN BAKER STREET OF MISTER DAUBENY'S PROPOSITION TO THE ELECTORS OF EAST BARSETSHIRE
3879-174923-0046 POOR MISSUS LOW WE CAN FORESEE THAT THERE IS MUCH GRIEF IN STORE FOR HER AND SOME ROCKS AHEAD TOO IN THE POLITICAL CAREER OF HER HUSBAND PHINEAS WAS STILL IN LONDON HANGING ABOUT THE CLUBS DOING NOTHING
3879-174923-0047 DISCUSSING MISTER DAUBENY'S WONDERFUL TREACHERY WITH SUCH MEN AS CAME UP TO TOWN AND WAITING FOR THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT WHEN HE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM LADY LAURA KENNEDY DRESDEN NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH
3879-174923-0048 I HAVE HEARD WITH GREAT PLEASURE FROM MY SISTER IN LAW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN STAYING WITH THEM AT HARRINGTON HALL IT SEEMS SO LIKE OLD DAYS THAT YOU AND OSWALD AND VIOLET SHOULD BE TOGETHER SO MUCH MORE NATURAL
3879-174923-0049 THAN THAT YOU SHOULD BE LIVING IN DUBLIN I CANNOT CONCEIVE OF YOU AS LIVING ANY OTHER LIFE THAN THAT OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DOWNING STREET AND THE CLUBS NOR DO I WISH TO DO SO
3879-174923-0050 AND WHEN I HEAR OF YOU AT HARRINGTON HALL I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO THE OTHER THINGS DO TELL ME WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITH OSWALD AND VIOLET OF COURSE HE NEVER WRITES HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ON MARRYING
3879-174923-0051 ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE AT LAST GOT A PERSON TO DO A DUTY WHICH HAS ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN NEGLECTED VIOLET DOES WRITE
3879-174923-0052 AS THE WIFE OF A MASTER OF HOUNDS
3879-174923-0053 AS THE ART IS REAL SHE TOLD ME HOW POOR DEAR LADY BALDOCK COMMUNICATED TO YOU HER UNHAPPINESS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER IN A MANNER THAT MADE EVEN ME LAUGH AND WOULD MAKE THOUSANDS LAUGH IN DAYS TO COME WERE IT EVER TO BE PUBLISHED
3879-174923-0054 BUT OF HER INSIDE LIFE OF HER BABY OR OF HER HUSBAND AS A HUSBAND SHE NEVER SAYS A WORD YOU WILL HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND HAVE ENOUGH OF THE FEMININE SIDE OF A MAN'S CHARACTER TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME HOW THEY ARE LIVING
3879-174923-0055 I AM SURE THEY ARE HAPPY TOGETHER BECAUSE VIOLET HAS MORE COMMON SENSE THAN ANY WOMAN I EVER KNEW AND PRAY TELL ME ABOUT THE AFFAIR AT TANKERVILLE MY COUSIN BARRINGTON WRITES ME WORD THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY GET THE SEAT
3879-174923-0056 HE DECLARES THAT MISTER BROWBOROUGH IS ALMOST DISPOSED NOT TO FIGHT THE BATTLE THOUGH A MAN MORE DISPOSED TO FIGHT NEVER BRIBED AN ELECTOR BUT BARRINGTON SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOU MANAGED AS WELL AS YOU DID BY GETTING OUTSIDE THE TRACES AS HE CALLS IT
3879-174923-0057 WE CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT STRONG AGAINST THE CHURCH
3879-174923-0058 BUT IF IT MUST COME WHY NOT BY YOUR HANDS AS WELL AS BY ANY OTHER IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT YOU IN YOUR HEART SHOULD LOVE A PROTESTANT ASCENDANT CHURCH BUT AS BARRINGTON SAYS A HORSE WON'T GET OATS
3879-174923-0059 AT HOME AS YOU KNOW NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS BUT HE WAS ACTIVE ALSO IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY NOW IT SEEMS TO HIM TO BE ALMOST TOO GREAT A TROUBLE TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIS STEWARD
3879-174923-0060 OR TO REMAIN HERE BY MYSELF BUT HE WILL CONSENT TO NEITHER IN TRUTH THE BURDEN OF IDLENESS HAS NOW FALLEN UPON HIM SO HEAVILY THAT HE CANNOT SHAKE IT OFF HE DREADS THAT HE MAY BE CALLED UPON TO DO ANYTHING
3879-174923-0061 TO ME IT IS ALL ONE TRAGEDY I CANNOT BUT THINK OF THINGS AS THEY WERE TWO OR THREE YEARS SINCE MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND WERE BOTH IN THE CABINET AND YOU YOUNG AS YOU WERE STOOD BUT ONE STEP BELOW IT OSWALD WAS OUT IN THE COLD HE WAS VERY POOR
3879-174923-0062 PAPA THOUGHT ALL EVIL OF HIM VIOLET HAD REFUSED HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE QUARRELLED WITH YOU AND ALL THE WORLD SEEMED AGAINST HIM THEN OF A SUDDEN YOU VANISHED AND WE VANISHED AN INEFFABLE MISERY FELL UPON ME AND UPON MY WRETCHED HUSBAND
3879-174923-0063 ALL OUR GOOD THINGS WENT FROM US AT A BLOW I AND MY POOR FATHER BECAME AS IT WERE OUTCASTS BUT OSWALD SUDDENLY RETRICKED HIS BEAMS AND IS FLAMING IN THE FOREHEAD OF THE MORNING SKY HE I BELIEVE
3879-174923-0064 HE WON HIS WIFE HONESTLY DID HE NOT AND HE HAS EVER BEEN HONEST IT IS MY PRIDE TO THINK I NEVER GAVE HIM UP BUT THE BITTER PART OF MY CUP CONSISTS IN THIS THAT AS HE HAS WON WHAT HE HAS DESERVED SO HAVE WE
3879-174923-0065 I COMPLAIN OF NO INJUSTICE OUR CASTLE WAS BUILT UPON THE SAND WHY SHOULD MISTER KENNEDY HAVE BEEN A CABINET MINISTER AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0066 THERE IS NO ONE WHOM I CAN ASK TO TELL ME OF HIM THAT HE DID NOT ATTEND DURING THE LAST SESSION I DO KNOW AND WE PRESUME THAT HE HAS NOW ABANDONED HIS SEAT I FEAR THAT HIS HEALTH IS BAD
3879-174923-0067 BY THE GLOOM OF HIS LIFE I SUPPOSE THAT HE LIVES EXCLUSIVELY AT LOUGHLINTER FROM TIME TO TIME I AM IMPLORED BY HIM TO RETURN TO MY DUTY BENEATH HIS ROOF HE GROUNDS HIS DEMAND ON NO AFFECTION OF HIS OWN
3879-174923-0068 ON NO PRESUMPTION THAT ANY AFFECTION CAN REMAIN WITH ME HE SAYS NO WORD OF HAPPINESS HE OFFERS NO COMFORT HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE WITH PROMISES OF FUTURE CARE HE MAKES HIS CLAIM SIMPLY ON HOLY WRIT AND ON THE FEELING OF DUTY WHICH
3879-174923-0069 THENCE OUGHT TO WEIGH UPON ME HE HAS NEVER EVEN TOLD ME THAT HE LOVES ME BUT HE IS PERSISTENT IN DECLARING THAT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS JOINED TOGETHER NOTHING HUMAN SHOULD SEPARATE
3879-174923-0070 I HAVE TOLD PAPA THAT I SHOULD ASK YOU AND HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED
3879-174923-0071 TO BE ABLE TO TALK AGAIN TO ONE WHO KNOWS ALL THE ERRORS AND ALL THE EFFORTS OF MY PAST LIFE AS YOU DO DRESDEN IS VERY COLD IN THE WINTER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD MIND THAT WE ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE ROOMS BUT MY FATHER BEARS THE TEMPERATURE WONDERFULLY WELL
3879-174923-0072 THOUGH HE COMPLAINS IN MARCH WE MOVE DOWN SOUTH FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS DO COME IF YOU CAN MOST SINCERELY YOURS LAURA KENNEDY
3807-4955-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE FLIGHT GABBETT GUIDED BY THE CROW HAD DETERMINED TO BEACH THE CAPTURED BOAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF CAPE SURVILLE IT WILL BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TOPOGRAPHY OF COLONEL ARTHUR'S PENITENTIARY
3807-4955-0001 THAT NOTHING BUT THE DESPERATE NATURE OF THE ATTEMPT COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED SO DESPERATE A MEASURE THE PERPENDICULAR CLIFFS SEEMED TO RENDER SUCH AN ATTEMPT CERTAIN DESTRUCTION BUT VETCH WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN BUILDING THE PIER AT THE NECK
3807-4955-0002 KNEW THAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF THE PROMONTORY WAS A STRIP OF BEACH UPON WHICH THE COMPANY MIGHT BY GOOD FORTUNE LAND IN SAFETY WITH SOMETHING OF THE DECISION OF HIS LEADER REX THE CROW DETERMINED AT ONCE THAT IN THEIR DESPERATE PLIGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY MEASURE
3807-4955-0003 AND SETTING HIS TEETH AS HE SEIZED THE OAR THAT SERVED AS A RUDDER HE PUT THE BOAT'S HEAD STRAIGHT FOR THE HUGE ROCK THAT FORMED THE NORTHERN HORN OF PIRATES BAY SAVE FOR THE FAINT PHOSPHORESCENT RADIANCE OF THE FOAMING WAVES THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE
3807-4955-0004 AND BURGESS FOR SOME MINUTES PULLED ALMOST AT RANDOM IN PURSUIT THE SAME TREMENDOUS FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF MC NAB BY CAUSING REX TO MISS HIS AIM SHOWED TO THE COMMANDANT THE WHALE BOAT BALANCED ON THE SUMMIT OF AN ENORMOUS WAVE
3807-4955-0005 AND APPARENTLY ABOUT TO BE FLUNG AGAINST THE WALL OF ROCK WHICH MAGNIFIED IN THE FLASH SEEMED FRIGHTFULLY NEAR TO THEM THE NEXT INSTANT BURGESS HIMSELF HIS BOAT LIFTED BY THE SWIFTLY ADVANCING BILLOW
3807-4955-0006 SAW A WILD WASTE OF RAGING SEAS SCOOPED INTO ABYSMAL TROUGHS IN WHICH THE BULK OF A LEVIATHAN MIGHT WALLOW AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THESE VALLEYS OF WATER LAY THE MUTINEERS BOAT LOOKING WITH ITS OUTSPREAD OARS LIKE SOME SIX LEGGED INSECT
3807-4955-0007 FLOATING IN A POOL OF INK THE GREAT CLIFF WHOSE EVERY SCAR AND CRAG WAS AS DISTINCT AS THOUGH ITS HUGE BULK WAS BUT A YARD DISTANT SEEMED TO SHOOT OUT FROM ITS BASE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLING INSECT A BROAD FLAT STRAW THAT WAS A STRIP OF DRY LAND
3807-4955-0008 THE NEXT INSTANT THE RUSHING WATER CARRYING THE SIX LEGGED ATOM WITH IT CREAMED UP OVER THIS STRIP OF BEACH
3807-4955-0009 APPEARED TO STOOP DOWN OVER THE OCEAN AND AS IT STOOPED THE BILLOW ROLLED ONWARDS THE BOAT GLIDED DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS AND THE WHOLE PHANTASMAGORIA WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE TUMULTUOUS DARKNESS OF THE TEMPEST BURGESS HIS HAIR BRISTLING WITH TERROR
3807-4955-0010 SHOUTED TO PUT THE BOAT ABOUT BUT HE MIGHT WITH AS MUCH REASON HAVE SHOUTED AT AN AVALANCHE THE WIND BLEW HIS VOICE AWAY AND EMPTIED IT VIOLENTLY INTO THE AIR A SNARLING BILLOW JERKED THE OAR FROM HIS HAND
3807-4955-0011 DESPITE THE DESPERATE EFFORTS OF THE SOLDIERS THE BOAT WAS WHIRLED UP THE MOUNTAIN OF WATER LIKE A LEAF ON A WATER SPOUT AND A SECOND FLASH OF LIGHTNING SHOWED THEM WHAT SEEMED A GROUP OF DOLLS STRUGGLING IN THE SURF AND A WALNUT SHELL BOTTOM UPWARDS WAS DRIVEN
3807-4955-0012 BY THE RECOIL OF THE WAVES TOWARDS THEM FOR AN INSTANT ALL THOUGHT THAT THEY MUST SHARE THE FATE WHICH HAD OVERTAKEN THE UNLUCKY CONVICTS BUT BURGESS SUCCEEDED IN TRIMMING THE BOAT AND AWED BY THE PERIL HE HAD SO NARROWLY ESCAPED GAVE THE ORDER TO RETURN
3807-4955-0013 AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
3807-4955-0014 AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE SHATTERED BOAT'S CREW CLINGING TO AN OAR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF EM ALIVE SAID BURGESS BANDAGING HIS SPRAINED WRIST TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS AT THE NECK AND HE'S FOOD FOR THE FISHES BY THIS TIME HE WAS MISTAKEN HOWEVER
3807-4955-0015 FATE HAD IN RESERVE FOR THE CREW OF VILLAINS A LESS MERCIFUL DEATH THAN THAT OF DROWNING AIDED BY THE LIGHTNING AND THAT WONDERFUL GOOD LUCK WHICH URGES VILLAINY TO ITS DESTRUCTION VETCH BEACHED THE BOAT AND THE PARTY BRUISED AND BLEEDING
3807-4955-0016 REACHED THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHORE IN SAFETY OF ALL THIS NUMBER ONLY COX WAS LOST HE WAS PULLING STROKE OAR AND BEING SOMETHING OF A LAGGARD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE CROW WHO SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF HASTE IN PRESERVING HIS OWN SKIN PLUCKED THE MAN BACKWARDS BY THE COLLAR
3807-4955-0017 AND PASSED OVER HIS SPRAWLING BODY TO THE SHORE COX GRASPING AT ANYTHING TO SAVE HIMSELF CLUTCHED AN OAR AND THE NEXT MOMENT FOUND HIMSELF BORNE OUT WITH THE OVERTURNED WHALE BOAT BY THE UNDER TOW HE WAS DRIFTED PAST HIS ONLY HOPE OF RESCUE THE GUARD BOAT
3807-4955-0018 WITH A VELOCITY THAT FORBADE ALL ATTEMPTS AT RESCUE AND ALMOST BEFORE THE POOR SCOUNDREL HAD TIME TO REALIZE HIS CONDITION HE WAS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY OF ESCAPING THE HANGING THAT HIS COMRADES HAD SO OFTEN HUMOROUSLY PROPHESIED FOR HIM
3807-4955-0019 BEING A STRONG AND VIGOROUS VILLAIN HOWEVER HE CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO HIS OAR AND EVEN UNBUCKLING HIS LEATHER BELT PASSED IT ROUND THE SLIP OF WOOD THAT WAS HIS SALVATION GIRDING HIMSELF TO IT AS FIRMLY AS HE WAS ABLE
3807-4955-0020 IN THIS CONDITION PLUS A SWOON FROM EXHAUSTION HE WAS DESCRIED BY THE HELMSMAN OF THE PRETTY MARY A FEW MILES FROM CAPE SURVILLE AT DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING
3807-4955-0021 LOWERED A BOAT AND PICKED HIM UP NEARLY BISECTED BY THE BELT GORGED WITH SALT WATER FROZEN WITH COLD AND HAVING TWO RIBS BROKEN THE VICTIM OF VETCH'S MURDEROUS QUICKNESS RETAINED SUFFICIENT LIFE TO SURVIVE BLUNT'S REMEDIES FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS
3807-4955-0022 DURING THAT TIME HE STATED THAT HIS NAME WAS COX THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM PORT ARTHUR WITH EIGHT OTHERS THAT JOHN REX WAS THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION THAT THE OTHERS WERE ALL DROWNED AND THAT HE BELIEVED JOHN REX HAD BEEN RETAKEN HAVING PLACED BLUNT IN POSSESSION OF THESE PARTICULARS
3807-4955-0023 HE FURTHER SAID THAT IT PRICKED HIM TO BREATHE CURSED JEMMY VETCH THE SETTLEMENT AND THE SEA AND SO IMPENITENTLY DIED BLUNT SMOKED THREE PIPES AND THEN ALTERED THE COURSE OF THE PRETTY MARY TWO POINTS TO THE EASTWARD AND RAN FOR THE COAST
3807-4955-0024 IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE MAN FOR WHOM HE WAS SEARCHING HAD NOT BEEN RETAKEN AND WAS EVEN NOW AWAITING HIS ARRIVAL IT WAS CLEARLY HIS DUTY HEARING OF THE PLANNED ESCAPE HAVING BEEN ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED NOT TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHILE HOPE REMAINED
3807-4955-0025 THE PRETTY MARY HUGGING THE COAST AS CLOSELY AS SHE DARED CRAWLED IN THE THIN BREEZE ALL DAY AND SAW NOTHING IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO LAND AT CAPE SURVILLE FOR THE WHOLE STATION WOULD BE ON THE ALERT SO BLUNT AS NIGHT WAS FALLING
3807-4955-0026 STOOD OFF A LITTLE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF PIRATES BAY HE WAS WALKING THE DECK GROANING AT THE FOLLY OF THE EXPEDITION WHEN A STRANGE APPEARANCE ON THE SOUTHERN HORN OF THE BAY MADE HIM COME TO A SUDDEN HALT THERE WAS A FURNACE BLAZING IN THE BOWELS OF THE MOUNTAIN
3807-4955-0027 BLUNT RUBBED HIS EYES AND STARED HE LOOKED AT THE MAN AT THE HELM DO YOU SEE ANYTHING YONDER JEM JEM A SYDNEY MAN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN ROUND THAT COAST BEFORE BRIEFLY REMARKED LIGHTHOUSE
3807-4955-0028 BLUNT STUMPED INTO THE CABIN AND GOT OUT HIS CHARTS NO LIGHTHOUSE WAS LAID DOWN THERE ONLY A MARK LIKE AN ANCHOR AND A NOTE REMARKABLE HOLE AT THIS POINT A REMARKABLE HOLE INDEED
3807-4955-0029 A REMARKABLE LIME KILN WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE PURPOSE BLUNT CALLED UP HIS MATE WILLIAM STAPLES A FELLOW WHOM SARAH PURFOY'S GOLD HAD BOUGHT BODY AND SOUL WILLIAM STAPLES LOOKED AT THE WAXING AND WANING GLOW FOR A WHILE
3807-4955-0030 AND THEN SAID IN TONES TREMBLING WITH GREED IT'S A FIRE LIE TO AND LOWER AWAY THE JOLLY BOAT OLD MAN THAT'S OUR BIRD FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS THE PRETTY MARY SHORTENED SAIL AND BLUNT AND STAPLES GOT INTO THE JOLLY BOAT
3807-4955-0031 GOIN A HOYSTERIN SIR SAID ONE OF THE CREW WITH A GRIN AS BLUNT THREW A BUNDLE INTO THE STERN SHEETS STAPLES THRUST HIS TONGUE INTO HIS CHEEK THE OBJECT OF THE VOYAGE WAS NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD AMONG THE CAREFULLY PICKED CREW
3807-4955-0032 BLUNT HAD NOT CHOSEN MEN WHO WERE LIKELY TO BETRAY HIM THOUGH FOR THAT MATTER REX HAD SUGGESTED A PRECAUTION WHICH RENDERED BETRAYAL ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
3807-4955-0033 CLOTHES RETURNED BLUNT WE CAN'T BRING HIM OFF IF IT IS HIM IN HIS CANARIES HE PUTS ON THESE DUDS D'YE SEE SINKS HER MAJESTY'S LIVERY AND COMES ABOARD A SHIPWRECKED MARINER THAT'S WELL THOUGHT OF WHOSE NOTION'S THAT
3807-4955-0034 THE MADAM'S I'LL BE BOUND AY SHE'S A KNOWING ONE AND THE SINISTER LAUGHTER OF THE PAIR FLOATED ACROSS THE VIOLET WATER GO EASY MAN SAID BLUNT AS THEY NEARED THE SHORE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE AT EAGLEHAWK AND IF THOSE CURSED DOGS GIVE TONGUE
3807-4955-0035 THERE'LL BE A BOAT OUT IN A TWINKLING IT'S LUCKY THE WIND'S OFF SHORE STAPLES LAY ON HIS OAR AND LISTENED THE NIGHT WAS MOONLESS AND THE SHIP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THEY WERE APPROACHING THE PROMONTORY FROM THE SOUTH EAST
3807-4955-0036 AND THIS ISTHMUS OF THE GUARDED NECK WAS HIDDEN BY THE OUTLYING CLIFF IN THE SOUTH WESTERN ANGLE OF THIS CLIFF ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN THE SUMMIT AND THE SEA WAS AN ARCH WHICH VOMITED A RED AND FLICKERING LIGHT THAT FAINTLY SHONE UPON THE SEA IN THE TRACK OF THE BOAT
3807-4955-0037 THE LIGHT WAS LAMBENT AND UNCERTAIN NOW SINKING ALMOST INTO INSIGNIFICANCE AND NOW LEAPING UP WITH A FIERCENESS THAT CAUSED A DEEP GLOW TO THROB IN THE VERY HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES A BLACK FIGURE WOULD PASS ACROSS THIS GIGANTIC FURNACE MOUTH
3807-4955-0038 STOOPING AND RISING AS THOUGH FEEDING THE FIRE ONE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THAT A DOOR IN VULCAN'S SMITHY
3807-4955-0039 AND THAT THE OLD HERO WAS FORGING ARMS FOR A DEMIGOD BLUNT TURNED PALE IT'S NO MORTAL HE WHISPERED LET'S GO BACK AND WHAT WILL MADAM SAY RETURNED DARE DEVIL WILL STAPLES WHO WOULD HAVE PLUNGED INTO MOUNT EREBUS HAD HE BEEN PAID FOR IT
5750-35690-0000 AFTER A LONG AND TEDIOUS DISCOURSE OF THESE SIX NON NATURAL THINGS AND THEIR SEVERAL RECTIFICATIONS
5750-35690-0001 OR THAT KIND OF PHYSIC WHICH CURETH BY MEDICINES WHICH APOTHECARIES MOST PART MAKE MINGLE OR SELL IN THEIR SHOPS MANY CAVIL AT THIS KIND OF PHYSIC AND HOLD IT UNNECESSARY UNPROFITABLE TO THIS OR ANY OTHER DISEASE
5750-35690-0002 BECAUSE THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH USE IT LEAST LIVE LONGEST
5750-35690-0003 RELATES OF THE ISLES OF ORCADES THE PEOPLE ARE STILL SOUND OF BODY AND MIND WITHOUT ANY USE OF PHYSIC
5750-35690-0004 DAMIANUS A GOES SAXO GRAMMATICUS AUBANUS BOHEMUS SAY THE LIKE OF THEM THAT LIVE IN NORWAY LAPLAND FINMARK BIARMIA CORELIA ALL OVER SCANDIA AND THOSE NORTHERN COUNTRIES THEY ARE MOST HEALTHFUL
5750-35690-0005 AND VERY LONG LIVED IN WHICH PLACES THERE IS NO USE AT ALL OF PHYSIC THE NAME OF IT IS NOT ONCE HEARD DITHMARUS BLESKENIUS IN HIS ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ICELAND SIXTEEN O SEVEN
5750-35690-0006 MOST PART THEY DRINK WATER AND WHEY
5750-35690-0007 I FIND THE SAME RELATION BY LERIUS AND SOME OTHER WRITERS OF INDIANS IN AMERICA PAULUS JOVIUS IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF BRITAIN AND LEVINUS LEMNIUS OBSERVE AS MUCH OF THIS OUR ISLAND
5750-35690-0008 AND BUT LITTLE AT THIS DAY EXCEPT IT BE FOR A FEW NICE IDLE CITIZENS SURFEITING COURTIERS AND STALL FED GENTLEMEN LUBBERS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE USE KITCHEN PHYSIC
5750-35690-0009 MANY THAT DID ILL UNDER PHYSICIANS HANDS HAVE HAPPILY ESCAPED
5750-35690-0010 LEFT TO GOD AND NATURE AND THEMSELVES
5750-35690-0011 JURIDICIS MEDICIS FISCO FAS VIVERE RAPTO TIS A CORRUPT TRADE NO SCIENCE ART NO PROFESSION THE BEGINNING PRACTICE AND PROGRESS OF IT ALL IS NAUGHT FULL OF IMPOSTURE UNCERTAINTY AND DOTH GENERALLY MORE HARM THAN GOOD
5750-35690-0012 THE DEVIL HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST INVENTOR OF IT
5750-35690-0013 AND WHAT WAS APOLLO BUT THE DEVIL THE GREEKS FIRST MADE AN ART OF IT AND THEY WERE ALL DELUDED BY APOLLO'S SONS PRIESTS ORACLES IF WE MAY BELIEVE VARRO PLINY COLUMELLA MOST OF THEIR BEST MEDICINES WERE DERIVED FROM HIS ORACLES
5750-35690-0014 AESCULAPIUS HIS SON HAD HIS TEMPLES ERECTED TO HIS DEITY AND DID MANY FAMOUS CURES BUT AS LACTANTIUS HOLDS HE WAS A MAGICIAN A MERE IMPOSTOR
5750-35690-0015 PERFORMED MOST OF THEIR CURES THE FIRST THAT EVER WROTE IN PHYSIC TO ANY PURPOSE WAS HIPPOCRATES AND HIS DISCIPLE AND COMMENTATOR GALEN WHOM SCALIGER CALLS FIMBRIAM HIPPOCRATIS
5750-35690-0016 THEIR PRECEPTS CONFUSED THEIR MEDICINES OBSOLETE AND NOW MOST PART REJECTED THOSE CURES WHICH THEY DID PARACELSUS HOLDS
5750-35690-0017 THEY THEMSELVES IDIOTS AND INFANTS AS ARE ALL THEIR ACADEMICAL FOLLOWERS THE ARABIANS RECEIVED IT FROM THE GREEKS AND SO THE LATINS ADDING NEW PRECEPTS AND MEDICINES OF THEIR OWN BUT SO IMPERFECT STILL THAT THROUGH IGNORANCE OF PROFESSORS IMPOSTORS MOUNTEBANKS EMPIRICS
5750-35690-0018 DISAGREEING OF SECTARIES WHICH ARE AS MANY ALMOST AS THERE BE DISEASES ENVY COVETOUSNESS AND THE LIKE THEY DO MUCH HARM AMONGST US
5750-35690-0019 AS HE SAID OF ADRIAN MULTITUDO MEDICORUM PRINCIPEM INTERFECIT A MULTITUDE OF PHYSICIANS HATH KILLED THE EMPEROR PLUS A MEDICO QUAM A MORBO PERICULI MORE DANGER THERE IS FROM THE PHYSICIAN THAN FROM THE DISEASE
5750-35690-0020 DOTH APPROPRIATE IT TO HERSELF AND TELLS A STORY OF ONE CURTIUS A PHYSICIAN IN VENICE BECAUSE HE WAS A STRANGER AND PRACTISED AMONGST THEM THE REST OF THE PHYSICIANS DID STILL CROSS HIM IN ALL HIS PRECEPTS IF HE PRESCRIBED HOT MEDICINES THEY WOULD PRESCRIBE COLD
5750-35690-0021 MISCENTES PRO CALIDIS FRIGIDA PRO FRIGIDIS HUMIDA PRO PURGANTIBUS ASTRINGENTIA BINDERS FOR PURGATIVES OMNIA PERTURBABANT IF THE PARTY MISCARRIED CURTIUM DAMNABANT CURTIUS KILLED HIM THAT DISAGREED FROM THEM
5750-35690-0022 SOMETIMES STUMBLES THEM ALL THEY CANNOT SO MUCH AS EASE THEY KNOW NOT HOW TO JUDGE OF IT IF BY PULSES THAT DOCTRINE SOME HOLD IS WHOLLY SUPERSTITIOUS
5750-35690-0023 IS NEITHER OBSERVED NOR UNDERSTOOD OF ANY AND FOR URINE THAT IS MERETRIX MEDICORUM THE MOST DECEITFUL THING OF ALL AS FORESTUS AND SOME OTHER PHYSICIANS HAVE PROVED AT LARGE
5750-35690-0024 I HAD RATHER BELIEVE AND COMMIT MYSELF TO A MERE EMPIRIC THAN TO A MERE DOCTOR AND I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY COMMEND THAT CUSTOM OF THE BABYLONIANS THAT HAVE NO PROFESSED PHYSICIANS BUT BRING ALL THEIR PATIENTS TO THE MARKET TO BE CURED
5750-35690-0025 WHICH HERODOTUS RELATES OF THE EGYPTIANS STRABO SARDUS AND AUBANUS BOHEMUS OF MANY OTHER NATIONS AND THOSE THAT PRESCRIBED PHYSIC
5750-35690-0026 A SECOND THE TEETH A THIRD THE HEAD
5750-35690-0027 I ACKNOWLEDGE IT A MOST NOBLE AND DIVINE SCIENCE
5750-35690-0028 AND THOSE OTHER GODS WERE CONFINED AND ADORED ALONE IN SOME PECULIAR PLACES AESCULAPIUS AND HIS TEMPLE AND ALTARS EVERYWHERE
5750-35690-0029 WITH ALL VIRTUOUS AND WISE MEN THEREFORE I HONOUR THE NAME AND CALLING AS I AM ENJOINED TO HONOUR THE PHYSICIAN FOR NECESSITY'S SAKE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN LIFTETH UP HIS HEAD AND IN THE SIGHT OF GREAT MEN HE SHALL BE ADMIRED
5750-35690-0030 BUT OF THIS NOBLE SUBJECT HOW MANY PANEGYRICS ARE WORTHILY WRITTEN
5750-35690-0031 I HAVE SAID YET ONE THING I WILL ADD THAT THIS KIND OF PHYSIC IS VERY MODERATELY AND ADVISEDLY TO BE USED
5750-35690-0032 IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OF SUCH PURGES AS ARE UNSEASONABLY OR IMMODERATELY TAKEN THEY HAVE THEIR EXCELLENT USE IN THIS AS WELL AS MOST OTHER INFIRMITIES OF ALTERATIVES AND CORDIALS NO MAN DOUBTS BE THEY SIMPLES OR COMPOUNDS
1235-135887-0000 THE STORY OF THE GRECIAN KING
1235-135887-0001 THERE WAS IN THE COUNTRY OF YUNAUN OR GREECE A KING WHO WAS LEPROUS AND HIS PHYSICIANS HAD IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED HIS CURE
1235-135887-0002 ARRIVED AT HIS COURT THIS PHYSICIAN HAD LEARNT THE THEORY OF HIS PROFESSION IN GREEK PERSIAN TURKISH ARABIC LATIN SYRIAC AND HEBREW BOOKS HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED NATURAL PHILOSOPHER
1235-135887-0003 I KNOW SAID HE AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIALS THAT YOUR MAJESTY'S PHYSICIANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HEAL YOU OF THE LEPROSY BUT IF YOU WILL ACCEPT MY SERVICE I WILL ENGAGE TO CURE YOU WITHOUT POTIONS
1235-135887-0004 OR EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS THE KING LISTENED TO WHAT HE SAID AND ANSWERED IF YOU BE ABLE TO PERFORM WHAT YOU PROMISE I WILL ENRICH YOU AND YOUR POSTERITY
1235-135887-0005 DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL CURE MY LEPROSY WITHOUT POTION OR APPLYING ANY EXTERNAL MEDICINE YES SIRE REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN I PROMISE MYSELF SUCCESS THROUGH GOD'S ASSISTANCE
1235-135887-0006 AND TO MORROW WITH YOUR MAJESTY'S PERMISSION I WILL MAKE THE TRIAL THE PHYSICIAN RETURNED TO HIS QUARTERS MADE A HOLLOW MACE AND AT THE HANDLE HE PUT IN HIS DRUGS
1235-135887-0007 WITH WHICH NEXT MORNING HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING AND FALLING DOWN AT HIS FEET KISSED THE GROUND
1235-135887-0008 AND AFTER A PROFOUND REVERENCE SAID TO THE KING HE JUDGED IT MEET THAT HIS MAJESTY SHOULD TAKE HORSE
1235-135887-0009 THE KING DID SO AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE THE PHYSICIAN CAME TO HIM WITH THE MACE AND SAID EXERCISE YOURSELF WITH THIS MACE AND STRIKE THE BALL UNTIL YOU FIND YOUR HANDS AND BODY PERSPIRE
1235-135887-0010 WHEN THE MEDICINE I HAVE PUT UP IN THE HANDLE OF THE MACE IS HEATED WITH YOUR HAND IT WILL PENETRATE YOUR WHOLE BODY AND AS SOON AS YOU PERSPIRE YOU MAY LEAVE OFF THE EXERCISE
1235-135887-0011 IMMEDIATELY ON YOUR RETURN TO YOUR PALACE GO INTO THE BATH AND CAUSE YOURSELF TO BE WELL WASHED AND RUBBED THEN RETIRE TO BED AND WHEN YOU RISE TO MORROW YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF CURED
1235-135887-0012 THE KING TOOK THE MACE AND STRUCK THE BALL WHICH WAS RETURNED BY HIS OFFICERS WHO PLAYED WITH HIM HE PLAYED SO LONG THAT HIS HANDS AND HIS WHOLE BODY WERE IN A SWEAT AND THEN THE MEDICINE SHUT UP IN THE HANDLE OF THE MACE HAD ITS OPERATION
1235-135887-0013 AS THE PHYSICIAN HAD SAID UPON THIS THE KING LEFT OFF PLAY RETURNED TO HIS PALACE ENTERED THE BATH AND OBSERVED VERY EXACTLY HIS PHYSICIAN HAD PRESCRIBED TO HIM
1235-135887-0014 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AROSE HE PERCEIVED WITH EQUAL WONDER AND JOY THAT HIS LEPROSY WAS CURED AND HIS BODY AS CLEAN AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN AFFECTED AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE CAME INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE WHERE HE ASCENDED HIS THRONE
1235-135887-0015 AND SHEWED HIMSELF TO HIS COURTIERS WHO EAGER TO KNOW THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDICINE CAME THITHER BETIMES AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING PERFECTLY CURED EXPRESSED GREAT JOY
1235-135887-0016 BOWED HIMSELF BEFORE THE THRONE WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND THE KING PERCEIVING HIM MADE HIM SIT DOWN BY HIS SIDE PRESENTED HIM TO THE ASSEMBLY AND GAVE HIM ALL THE COMMENDATION HE DESERVED
1235-135887-0017 BUT AS HE TREATED ALL HIS COURT THAT DAY MADE HIM EAT AT HIS TABLE ALONE WITH HIM
1235-135887-0018 BUT CAUSED HIM TO BE CLAD IN A RICH ROBE
1235-135887-0019 CONTINUED EVERY DAY TO LOAD HIM WITH NEW FAVOURS BUT THIS KING HAD A VIZIER WHO WAS AVARICIOUS ENVIOUS AND NATURALLY CAPABLE OF EVERY KIND OF MISCHIEF
1235-135887-0020 HE COULD NOT BEHOLD WITHOUT ENVY THE PRESENTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE PHYSICIAN WHOSE OTHER MERITS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS
1235-135887-0021 TO EFFECT THIS HE WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM IN PRIVATE THAT HE HAD SOME INFORMATION OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMMUNICATE THE KING HAVING ASKED WHAT IT WAS SIRE SAID HE
1235-135887-0022 IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS FOR A MONARCH TO CONFIDE IN A MAN WHOSE FIDELITY HE HAS NEVER TRIED
1235-135887-0023 I AM WELL INFORMED OF WHAT I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR TO REVEAL TO YOUR MAJESTY THEREFORE DO NOT REST IN DANGEROUS SECURITY IF YOUR MAJESTY BE ASLEEP BE PLEASED TO AWAKE
1235-135887-0024 AND CAME TO SETTLE HIMSELF AT YOUR COURT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EXECUTING THE HORRIBLE DESIGN WHICH I HAVE INTIMATED NO NO VIZIER INTERRUPTED THE KING
1235-135887-0025 I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS PHYSICIAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT TO BE A VILLAIN AND A TRAITOR IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST VIRTUOUS OF MEN YOU KNOW BY WHAT MEDICINE OR RATHER BY WHAT MIRACLE HE CURED ME OF MY LEPROSY
1235-135887-0026 IF HE HAD HAD A DESIGN UPON MY LIFE WHY DID HE SAVE ME THEN HE NEEDED ONLY TO HAVE LEFT ME TO MY DISEASE I COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED IT AS LIFE WAS FAST DECAYING FORBEAR THEN TO FILL ME WITH UNJUST SUSPICIONS
1235-135887-0027 INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO YOU I TELL YOU THAT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD I WILL GIVE THAT GREAT MAN A PENSION OF A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD PER MONTH FOR HIS LIFE NAY THOUGH I WERE TO SHARE WITH HIM ALL MY RICHES AND DOMINIONS
1235-135887-0028 I SHOULD NEVER PAY HIM SUFFICIENTLY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE I PERCEIVE IT TO BE HIS VIRTUE THAT RAISES YOUR ENVY BUT DO NOT THINK I WILL BE UNJUSTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST HIM I REMEMBER TOO WELL WHAT A VIZIER SAID TO KING SINBAD HIS MASTER
1235-135887-0029 TO PREVENT HIS PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRINCE HIS SON WHAT THE GRECIAN KING SAID ABOUT KING SINBAD RAISED THE VIZIER'S CURIOSITY WHO SAID I PRAY YOUR MAJESTY TO PARDON ME
1235-135887-0030 IF I HAVE THE BOLDNESS TO ASK WHAT THE VIZIER OF KING SINBAD SAID TO HIS MASTER TO DIVERT HIM FROM PUTTING THE PRINCE HIS SON TO DEATH THE GRECIAN KING HAD THE CONDESCENSION TO SATISFY HIM THAT VIZIER SAID HE
1235-135887-0031 AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED TO KING SINBAD THAT HE OUGHT TO BEWARE LEST ON THE ACCUSATION OF A MOTHER IN LAW HE SHOULD COMMIT AN ACTION OF WHICH HE MIGHT AFTERWARDS REPENT
1235-135884-0000 WHAT IS MORE MY WIFE SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN I MARRIED HER SO THAT I MAY JUSTLY SAY SHE OUGHT TO REGARD ME EQUALLY AS HER FATHER HER KINSMAN AND HER HUSBAND
1235-135884-0001 WE LIVED TOGETHER TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT ANY CHILDREN HER BARRENNESS DID NOT EFFECT ANY CHANGE IN MY LOVE I STILL TREATED HER WITH MUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION
1235-135884-0002 MY DESIRE OF HAVING CHILDREN ONLY INDUCED ME TO PURCHASE A SLAVE BY WHOM I HAD A SON WHO WAS EXTREMELY PROMISING MY WIFE BEING JEALOUS CHERISHED A HATRED FOR BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD
1235-135884-0003 BUT CONCEALED HER AVERSION SO WELL THAT I KNEW NOTHING OF IT TILL IT WAS TOO LATE MEAN TIME MY SON GREW UP AND WAS TEN YEARS OLD WHEN I WAS OBLIGED TO UNDERTAKE A LONG JOURNEY
1235-135884-0004 BEFORE I WENT I RECOMMENDED TO MY WIFE OF WHOM I HAD NO MISTRUST THE SLAVE AND HER SON AND PRAYED HER TO TAKE CARE OF THEM DURING MY ABSENCE WHICH WAS TO BE FOR A WHOLE YEAR
1235-135884-0005 SHE HOWEVER EMPLOYED THAT TIME TO SATISFY HER HATRED SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO MAGIC
1235-135884-0006 THE WRETCH CARRIED MY SON TO A DESOLATE PLACE WHERE BY HER ENCHANTMENTS SHE CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AND GAVE HIM TO MY FARMER TO FATTEN PRETENDING SHE HAD BOUGHT HIM
1235-135884-0007 HER ENMITY DID NOT STOP AT THIS ABOMINABLE ACTION BUT SHE LIKEWISE CHANGED THE SLAVE INTO A COW AND GAVE HER ALSO TO MY FARMER AT MY RETURN I ENQUIRED FOR THE MOTHER AND CHILD
1235-135884-0008 YOUR SLAVE SAID SHE IS DEAD AND AS FOR YOUR SON I KNOW NOT WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THIS TWO MONTHS I WAS AFFLICTED AT THE DEATH OF THE SLAVE
1235-135884-0009 BUT AS SHE INFORMED ME MY SON HAD ONLY DISAPPEARED I WAS IN HOPES HE WOULD SHORTLY RETURN HOWEVER EIGHT MONTHS PASSED AND I HEARD NOTHING OF HIM WHEN THE FESTIVAL OF THE GREAT BAIRAM WAS TO BE CELEBRATED
1235-135884-0010 THE UNFORTUNATE MOTHER OF MY SON I BOUND HER BUT AS I WAS GOING TO SACRIFICE HER SHE BELLOWED PITEOUSLY AND I COULD PERCEIVE TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES THIS SEEMED TO ME VERY EXTRAORDINARY
1235-135884-0011 AND FINDING MYSELF MOVED WITH COMPASSION I COULD NOT FIND IN MY HEART TO GIVE HER A BLOW BUT ORDERED MY FARMER TO GET ME ANOTHER MY WIFE WHO WAS PRESENT WAS ENRAGED AT MY TENDERNESS
1235-135884-0012 AND RESISTING AN ORDER WHICH DISAPPOINTED HER MALICE SHE CRIED OUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUSBAND SACRIFICE THAT COW YOUR FARMER HAS NOT A FINER NOR ONE FITTER FOR THE FESTIVAL OUT OF DEFERENCE TO MY WIFE I CAME AGAIN TO THE COW
1235-135884-0013 AND COMBATING MY COMPASSION WHICH SUSPENDED THE SACRIFICE WAS GOING TO GIVE HER THE FATAL BLOW WHEN THE VICTIM REDOUBLING HER TEARS AND BELLOWING DISARMED ME A SECOND TIME
1235-135884-0014 I THEN PUT THE MALLET INTO THE FARMER'S HANDS AND DESIRED HIM TO TAKE IT AND SACRIFICE HER HIMSELF FOR HER TEARS AND BELLOWING PIERCED MY HEART THE FARMER LESS COMPASSIONATE THAN MYSELF SACRIFICED HER
1235-135884-0015 THOUGH TO SHE SEEMED VERY FAT TAKE HER YOURSELF SAID I TO HIM
1235-135884-0016 I DID NOT ENQUIRE WHAT HE DID WITH THE COW BUT SOON AFTER HE HAD TAKEN HER AWAY HE RETURNED WITH A FAT CALF THOUGH I KNEW NOT THE CALF WAS MY SON YET I COULD NOT FORBEAR BEING MOVED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM ON HIS PART
1235-135884-0017 AS SOON AS HE BEHELD ME HE MADE SO GREAT AN EFFORT TO COME NEAR ME THAT HE BROKE HIS CORD
1235-135884-0018 WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND AS IF HE MEANT TO EXCITE MY COMPASSION CONJURING ME NOT TO BE SO CRUEL AS TO TAKE HIS LIFE AND DID AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SIGNIFY THAT HE WAS MY SON
1235-135884-0019 I WAS MORE SURPRISED AND AFFECTED WITH THIS ACTION THAN WITH THE TEARS OF THE COW I FELT A TENDER PITY WHICH INTERESTED ME ON HIS BEHALF OR RATHER NATURE DID ITS DUTY
1235-135884-0020 GO SAID I TO THE FARMER CARRY HOME THAT CALF TAKE GREAT CARE OF HIM AND BRING ME ANOTHER IN HIS STEAD IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS MY WIFE HEARD ME GIVE THIS ORDER SHE EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HUSBAND
1235-135884-0021 TAKE MY ADVICE SACRIFICE NO OTHER CALF BUT THAT WIFE I REPLIED I WILL NOT SACRIFICE HIM I WILL SPARE HIM AND PRAY DO NOT YOU OPPOSE ME
1235-135884-0022 THE WICKED WOMAN HAD NO REGARD TO MY WISHES SHE HATED MY SON TOO MUCH TO CONSENT THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM I TIED THE POOR CREATURE AND TAKING UP THE FATAL KNIFE WAS GOING TO PLUNGE IT INTO MY SON'S THROAT
1235-135884-0023 WHEN TURNING HIS EYES BATHED WITH TEARS IN A LANGUISHING MANNER TOWARDS ME HE AFFECTED ME SO MUCH THAT I HAD NOT STRENGTH TO KILL HIM I LET THE KNIFE FALL AND TOLD MY WIFE POSITIVELY
1235-135884-0024 THAT I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER CALF TO SACRIFICE AND NOT THAT SHE USED ALL HER ENDEAVOURS TO PERSUADE ME TO CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BUT I CONTINUED FIRM
1235-135884-0025 I COME SAID HE TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU A PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL RETURN ME THANKS I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT HAS SOME SKILL IN MAGIC YESTERDAY
1235-135884-0026 THESE TWO METAMORPHOSES WERE MADE BY THE ENCHANTMENTS OF OUR MASTER'S WIFE WHO HATED BOTH THE MOTHER
1235-135884-0027 THIS IS WHAT MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME SAID THE FARMER AND I COME TO ACQUAINT YOU WITH IT I LEAVE YOU TO JUDGE HOW MUCH I WAS SURPRISED I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MY FARMER TO SPEAK TO HIS DAUGHTER MYSELF
1235-135884-0028 AS SOON AS I ARRIVED I WENT FORTHWITH TO THE STALL WHERE MY SON WAS KEPT HE COULD NOT RETURN MY EMBRACES BUT RECEIVED THEM IN SUCH A MANNER AS FULLY SATISFIED ME HE WAS MY SON
1235-135884-0029 MY GOOD MAID SAID I CAN YOU RESTORE MY SON TO HIS FORMER SHAPE YES SHE REPLIED I CAN
1235-135884-0030 EXCEPT ON TWO CONDITIONS THE FIRST IS THAT YOU GIVE HIM TO ME FOR MY HUSBAND AND THE SECOND THAT YOU ALLOW ME TO PUNISH THE PERSON WHO CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AS TO THE FIRST I REPLIED
1235-135884-0031 AS TO WHAT RELATES TO MY WIFE I ALSO AGREE A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN CAPABLE OF COMMITTING SUCH A CRIMINAL ACTION JUSTLY DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED
1235-135884-0032 ONLY I MUST PRAY YOU NOT TO TAKE HER LIFE I AM GOING THEN ANSWERED SHE TO TREAT HER AS SHE TREATED YOUR SON TO THIS I CONSENT SAID I
1235-135884-0033 PROVIDED YOU FIRST OF ALL RESTORE TO ME MY SON
1235-135884-0034 PRONOUNCED OVER IT WORDS THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESSING HERSELF TO THE CALF O CALF IF THOU WEST CREATED BY THE ALMIGHTY AND SOVEREIGN MASTER OF THE WORLD SUCH AS THOU APPEAREST AT THIS TIME CONTINUE IN THAT FORM
1235-135884-0035 BUT IF THOU BE A MAN AND ART CHANGED INTO A CALF BY ENCHANTMENT RETURN TO THY NATURAL SHAPE BY THE PERMISSION OF THE SOVEREIGN CREATOR AS SHE SPOKE SHE THREW WATER UPON HIM
1235-135884-0036 AND IN AN INSTANT HE RECOVERED HIS NATURAL FORM MY SON
1235-135884-0037 WITH SUCH A TRANSPORT OF JOY THAT I KNEW NOT WHAT I WAS DOING IT IS HEAVEN THAT HATH SENT US THIS YOUNG MAID TO REMOVE THE HORRIBLE CHARM BY WHICH YOU WERE ENCHANTED AND TO AVENGE THE INJURY DONE TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER I DOUBT NOT
1235-135884-0038 BUT IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT YOU WILL MAKE YOUR DELIVERER YOUR WIFE AS I HAVE PROMISED HE JOYFULLY CONSENTED BUT BEFORE THEY MARRIED SHE CHANGED MY WIFE INTO A HIND AND THIS IS SHE WHOM YOU SEE HERE
1235-135884-0039 I DESIRED SHE MIGHT HAVE THIS SHAPE RATHER THAN ANOTHER LESS AGREEABLE THAT WE MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FAMILY WITHOUT HORROR SINCE THAT TIME MY SON IS BECOME A WIDOWER AND GONE TO TRAVEL
1235-135884-0040 IT BEING NOW SEVERAL YEARS SINCE I HEARD OF HIM I AM COME ABROAD TO INQUIRE AFTER HIM AND NOT BEING WILLING TO TRUST ANYBODY WITH MY WIFE TILL I SHOULD RETURN HOME I THOUGHT FIT TO TAKE HER EVERYWHERE WITH ME
1235-135884-0041 THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MYSELF AND THIS HIND IS IT NOT ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL AND SURPRISING I ADMIT IT IS SAID THE GENIE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT FORGIVE THE MERCHANT ONE THIRD OF HIS CRIME
6563-63821-0000 PETER FORCE ONE OF THE INTERESTING SIGHTS OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON USED TO BE THE LIBRARY OF OLD PETER FORCE AS HE WAS FAMILIARLY CALLED COLONEL PETER FORCE AS HE WAS MORE PROPERLY STYLED
6563-63821-0001 HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW COLONELS OF THAT DAY WHO HAD ACTUALLY HELD A COLONEL'S COMMAND HAVING BEEN REGULARLY COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS A COLONEL OF ARTILLERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN CALLED MAJOR GENERAL
6563-63821-0002 FOR IN HIS OLD AGE HE HELD THAT RANK IN THE MILITIA OF THE DISTRICT AND A VERY FINE LOOKING SOLDIER HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS PRIME JUDGING FROM THE PORTRAIT WHICH USED TO HANG IN THE LIBRARY REPRESENTING A FULL FORMED MAN TALL AND ERECT
6563-63821-0003 HIS HANDSOME AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE SET OFF BY AN ABUNDANCE OF CURLY HAIR HIS LIBRARY HAD ABOUT THE ROUGHEST FURNITURE EVER SEEN IN AN APARTMENT CONTAINING SO MUCH THAT WAS VALUABLE AS I REMEMBER IT IT WAS A LONG LOW ROOM
6563-63821-0004 WITH STREETS AND CROSS STREETS OF PINE BOOK SHELVES UNPAINTED ALL FILLED WITH BOOKS TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY A WILDERNESS OF BOOKS IN PRINT AND IN MANUSCRIPT MOSTLY OLD AND DINGY
6563-63821-0005 AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM RELATING IN SOME WAY TO AMERICAN HISTORY THE PLACE HAD A VERY MUSTY SMELL AND AS MOST OF ITS TREASURES WERE IN THE ORIGINAL BINDINGS OR WITHOUT BINDINGS FEW PERSONS WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE COLLECTION
6563-63821-0006 I AM ACQUAINTED WITH A CERTAIN LIBRARY IN NEW YORK OF SEVERAL THOUSAND VOLUMES MOST OF WHICH ARE BOUND RESPLENDENTLY IN CALF AND GOLD AND THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY ARE KEPT IS AS SPLENDID AS A STEAMBOAT
6563-63821-0007 BUT OLD PETER FORCE COULD SHOW YOU SINGLE ALCOVES OF HIS LIBRARY WHICH AT A FAIR VALUATION WOULD BUY OUT ALL THAT MASS OF SUMPTUOSITY IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS DUSTY DINGY WILDERNESS
6563-63821-0008 HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING HIS TREASURES HE WOULD TAKE DOWN HIS EXCELLENT COPY OF ELIOT'S INDIAN BIBLE A BOOK SO FAITHFULLY MADE IN EVERY RESPECT THAT I QUESTION IF AS A MERE PIECE OF BOOK MAKING
6563-63821-0009 IT COULD NOW BE MATCHED IN THE UNITED STATES HE LIVED TO SEE THIS RARITY COMMAND IN NEW YORK THE PRICE OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HE WOULD SHOW YOU FORTY ONE WORKS IN THE ORIGINAL EDITIONS OF INCREASE AND COTTON MATHER
6563-63821-0010 THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE HE POSSESSED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED AND BOUND BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HE HAD TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES OF THE RECORDS OF COLONIAL LEGISLATURES
6563-63821-0011 HE COULD SHOW YOU A NEWSPAPER OF ALMOST EVERY MONTH NAY ALMOST EVERY WEEK SINCE NEWSPAPERS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN AMERICA HE HAD IN ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOUND VOLUMES OF NEWSPAPERS OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0012 HE WOULD SHOW YOU A COLLECTION OF MORE THAN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND PAMPHLETS OF WHICH EIGHT THOUSAND WERE PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HIS COLLECTION OF MAPS RELATING TO AMERICA WAS TRULY WONDERFUL BESIDES ALL THE EARLY ATLASES OF ANY NOTE
6563-63821-0013 HE HAD OVER A THOUSAND DETACHED MAPS ILLUSTRATIVE BOTH OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF AMERICA FOR MANY OF THEM WERE MAPS AND PLANS DRAWN FOR MILITARY PURPOSES HE WOULD SHOW YOU PERHAPS
6563-63821-0014 A PEN DRAWING OF DATE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY A BRITISH OFFICER UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN PLAN OF THE REBEL WORKS AT WEST POINT HE HAD ALSO SEVERAL PLANS BY BRITISH OFFICERS OF THE REBEL WORKS AROUND BOSTON DURING THE REVOLUTION
6563-63821-0015 BESIDES SUCH THINGS AND HE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED PLANS AND MAPS OF WHICH THERE WAS NO OTHER COPY IN EXISTENCE HE POSSESSED A SURPRISING NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED IN THE INFANCY OF THE PRINTER'S ART AMONG THEM
6563-63821-0016 SPECIMENS REPRESENTING EVERY YEAR FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ONWARD HE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOOKS PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED SO ARRANGED THAT A STUDENT COULD TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE ART OF PRINTING FROM THE DAYS OF CAXTON
6563-63821-0017 HE HAD ALSO A VAST COLLECTION OF MANUSCRIPTS NUMBERING FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0018 THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN THE LIBRARY WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AND THE NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND THE READER PERHAPS IMAGINES THAT THE COLLECTOR OF SUCH A LIBRARY MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY RICH MAN
6563-63821-0019 AND THAT HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IN SEARCH OF THESE PRECIOUS OBJECTS NOT AT ALL HE NEVER WAS A RICH MAN AND I BELIEVE HE RARELY TRAVELED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL INDEED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIS COLLECTION WAS THAT HE
6563-63821-0020 WHO BEGAN LIFE A JOURNEYMAN PRINTER AND WAS NEVER IN THE RECEIPT OF A LARGE INCOME SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TOGETHER SO VAST AN AMOUNT OF VALUABLE MATERIAL PART OF THE SECRET WAS THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE HIS COLLECTION THESE THINGS WERE NOT VALUED
6563-63821-0021 AND HE OBTAINED MANY OF HIS MOST PRECIOUS RELICS BY MERELY TAKING THE TROUBLE TO CARRY THEM AWAY FROM THE GARRETS IN WHICH THEY WERE MOULDERING INTO DUST UNPRIZED AND UNKNOWN A WISE OLD NEW YORK MERCHANT LONG AGO HIMSELF MOULDERED INTO DUST
6563-63821-0022 USED TO SAY MEN GENERALLY GET IN THIS WORLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT HOW CAN THAT BE ASKED A YOUNGSTER ONE DAY
6563-63821-0023 BUT VERY FEW OF THEM EVER WILL BE I WANT A MILLION OR SO MYSELF AH BOY THE OLD MAN REPLIED YOU WANT A MILLION BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT ENOUGH WHAT YOU WANT AT PRESENT IS PLEASURE AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH
6563-63821-0024 THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND ALL YOUR SURPLUS FORCE TIME AND REVENUE TO GET IT IF YOU WANTED YOUR MILLION AS MUCH AS YOU WANT PLEASURE BY AND BY WHEN YOU HAVE A BALD HEAD LIKE MINE YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR MILLION
6563-63821-0025 PETER FORCE WAS A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE OLD MERCHANT'S DOCTRINE HE GOT ALL THESE PRECIOUS THINGS BECAUSE HE WANTED THEM WITH A SUSTAINED PASSION OF DESIRE FOR HALF A CENTURY THERE NEVER WAS A TIME WHEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE GLADLY GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
6563-63821-0026 AND WALKED TEN MILES IN THE FACE OF A NORTHEASTERLY STORM TO GET A RARE PAMPHLET OF FOUR PAGES HE WAS A MISER OF SUCH THINGS BUT NO THAT WORD DOES NOT DESCRIBE HIM FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0027 WAS TO COMMUNICATE HIS TREASURES TO OTHERS AND HE COMMUNICATED TO THE WHOLE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE BEST OF HIS COLLECTIONS IN MASSIVE VOLUMES OF AMERICAN ARCHIVES HE WAS A MISER ONLY IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS DESIRE MORE THAN ONCE HE SAID TO MISTER GEORGE W GREENE
6563-63821-0028 DID I HESITATE BETWEEN A BARREL OF FLOUR AND A RARE BOOK BUT THE BOOK ALWAYS GOT THE UPPER HAND TO THE SAME FRIEND HE MADE A REMARK WHICH SHOWS THAT HIS DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WAS QUITE AS STRONG AS HIS DESIRE TO OBTAIN WHENEVER SAID HE
6563-63821-0029 I FOUND A LITTLE MORE MONEY IN MY PURSE THAN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED I PUBLISHED A VOLUME OF HISTORICAL TRACTS IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE OLD MAN RELATE HOW THIS TASTE FOR THE TREASURES OF HISTORY WAS FORMED IN HIS MIND HIS FATHER
6563-63821-0030 WHO SERVED DURING THE REVOLUTION IN A NEW JERSEY REGIMENT RETIRED AFTER THE WAR TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND AT HIS HOUSE THE JERSEY VETERANS LIKED TO MEET AND TALK OVER THE INCIDENTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS THEY HAD MADE TOGETHER PETER AS A BOY
6563-63821-0031 LOVED TO HEAR THEM TELL THEIR STORIES AND AS HE LISTENED THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM ONE EVENING WHY SHOULD ALL THIS BE FORGOTTEN BOY AS HE WAS HE BEGAN TO WRITE THEM DOWN UNDER THE TITLE OF THE UNWRITTEN HISTORY OF THE WAR IN NEW JERSEY
6563-63821-0032 HE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUSCRIPT WAS LOST THE TASTE THEN FORMED GREW WITH HIS GROWTH AND STRENGTHENED WITH HIS STRENGTH AT TEN HE LEFT SCHOOL FOREVER AND WENT INTO A PRINTING OFFICE
6563-63821-0033 WHICH HAS PROVED AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL TO MORE THAN ONE VALUABLE AMERICAN MIND HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLISHED PRINTER AND AT TWENTY TWO WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK TYPOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY AN ORGANIZATION WHICH STILL EXISTS
6563-63821-0034 THEN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BEGAN LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE SERVED IN THE ARMY FIRST AS PRIVATE THEN AS SERGEANT THEN AS SERGEANT MAJOR THEN AS ENSIGN FINALLY AS LIEUTENANT THE WAR ENDED
6563-63821-0035 HE WENT TO WASHINGTON AS FOREMAN OF A PRINTING OFFICE AND AT WASHINGTON AS PRINTER EDITOR PUBLISHER AND COLLECTOR HE LIVED THE REST OF HIS LONG AND HONORABLE LIFE NEVER RICH AS I HAVE BEFORE REMARKED
6563-63821-0036 THOUGH NEVER WITHOUT A SHARE OF REASONABLE PROSPERITY THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK OF HIS LIFE WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN ARCHIVES IN WHICH HE WAS AIDED BY CONGRESS HE FURNISHING THE DOCUMENTS AND THE LABOR
6563-63821-0037 AND CONGRESS PAYING THE COST OF PUBLICATION THROUGH THE NINE VOLUMES OF THIS WORK A GREAT NUMBER OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING RECORDS AND MEMORIALS OF AMERICAN HISTORY ARE NOT ONLY PRESERVED BUT MADE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO CAN GET NEAR A LIBRARY
6563-63821-0038 HE HAD ALL THE STATE HOUSES OF THE COUNTRY RANSACKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND A ROOM WAS ASSIGNED HIM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN WHICH HIS CLERKS COULD CONVENIENTLY COPY THEM ALL WENT WELL WITH THE WORK UNTIL WILLIAM MARCY BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE
6563-63821-0039 WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO EXAMINE AND APPROVE EACH VOLUME BEFORE IT WENT TO THE PRINTER WHEN PETER FORCE PRESENTED THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME TO SECRETARY MARCY HE RECEIVED A REBUFF WHICH THREW A CLOUD OVER SEVERAL YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0040 I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK SIR SAID THE SECRETARY IT IS OF NO USE TO ANYBODY I NEVER READ A PAGE OF IT AND NEVER EXPECT TO BUT SAID MISTER FORCE THE WORK IS PUBLISHED IN VIRTUE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
6563-63821-0041 HERE IS THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME IF THERE IS ANYTHING THERE WHICH YOU THINK OUGHT NOT TO BE THERE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO POINT IT OUT TO ME YOU MAY LEAVE THE PAPERS SIR SAID THE SECRETARY HE LEFT THE PAPERS
6563-63821-0042 BUT NEITHER MARCY NOR HIS SUCCESSORS EVER FOUND TIME TO EXAMINE THAT TENTH VOLUME THOUGH ON THE FIRST DAY OF EVERY OFFICIAL YEAR THE COMPILER CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO IT FOR SEVEN YEARS HE WAS A SUITOR ON BEHALF OF HIS BELOVED TENTH VOLUME
6563-63821-0043 AND THEN THE WAR OCCURRED AND ALL SUCH MATTERS WERE NECESSARILY PUT ASIDE HE WAS NOW SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND HIS GREAT DESIRE WAS TO DISPOSE OF HIS LIBRARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS TREASURES WOULD NOT BE SCATTERED ABROAD
6563-63821-0044 AND PERHAPS LOST FOREVER TO THE COUNTRY AT LENGTH CONGRESS HAVING SANCTIONED THE ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY THEIR LIBRARIAN MISTER SPOFFORD INDUCED THEM TO PURCHASE THE WHOLE MASS JUST AS IT STOOD
6563-63821-0045 FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE COLLECTION NOW FORMS PART OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY COLONEL FORCE LIVED TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN HE DIED AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSALLY BELOVED AND LAMENTED
6563-63821-0046 IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS AGE ENJOYING ALMOST TO THE LAST TWO OF THE THINGS HE LOVED BEST HIS BOOKS
2843-152918-0000 THEY HAD UNDERGONE A REMARKABLE CHANGE SINCE OUR ARRIVAL AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP THEY NOW WANDERED ABOUT FAT SLEEK AND CONTENTED AND THEIR FORMER VORACITY HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
2843-152918-0001 AS REGARDS OURSELVES A DAY OR TWO LONGER MADE NO DIFFERENCE OUR MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLE OF DIET THE PEMMICAN WAS PRACTICALLY LEFT UNTOUCHED AS FOR THE TIME BEING DOG HAD COMPLETELY TAKEN ITS PLACE
2843-152918-0002 THERE WAS THUS NO GREAT SIGN OF DEPRESSION TO BE NOTICED WHEN WE CAME BACK INTO THE TENT AFTER FINISHING OUR WORK AND HAD TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS I WENT IN I COULD DESCRY WISTING A LITTLE WAY OFF KNEELING ON THE GROUND
2843-152918-0003 AND ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CUTLETS THE DOGS STOOD IN A RING ROUND HIM AND LOOKED ON WITH INTEREST THE NORTH EAST WIND WHISTLED AND HOWLED THE AIR WAS THICK WITH DRIVING SNOW AND WISTING WAS NOT TO BE ENVIED
2843-152918-0004 TO WHATEVER AGE I MAY LIVE IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THE WIND HAD GONE BACK TO THE NORTH AND INCREASED TO A GALE IT WAS BLOWING AND SNOWING SO THAT WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE MORNING WE COULD NOT SEE THE SLEDGES THEY WERE HALF SNOWED UNDER
2843-152918-0005 THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOT SO VERY LOW
2843-152918-0006 WE HAD ALL TAKEN A TURN OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND WERE SITTING ON OUR SLEEPING BAGS DISCUSSING THE POOR PROSPECT IT'S THE DEVIL'S OWN WEATHER HERE AT THE BUTCHER'S SAID ONE IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT WOULD NEVER GET ANY BETTER
2843-152918-0007 THIS IS THE FIFTH DAY AND IT'S BLOWING WORSE THAN EVER WE ALL AGREED THERE'S NOTHING SO BAD AS LYING WEATHER BOUND LIKE THIS CONTINUED ANOTHER IT TAKES MORE OUT OF YOU THAN GOING FROM MORNING TO NIGHT PERSONALLY I WAS OF THE SAME OPINION
2843-152918-0008 ONE DAY MAY BE PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT TWO THREE FOUR
2843-152918-0009 NO IT WAS AWFUL SHALL WE TRY IT NO SOONER WAS THE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED THAN IT WAS ACCEPTED UNANIMOUSLY AND WITH ACCLAMATION WHEN I THINK OF MY FOUR FRIENDS OF THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2843-152918-0010 IT IS THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING THAT COMES FIRST TO MY MIND ALL THE QUALITIES THAT I MOST ADMIRE IN A MAN WERE CLEARLY SHOWN AT THAT JUNCTURE COURAGE AND DAUNTLESSNESS WITHOUT BOASTING OR BIG WORDS
2843-152918-0011 AMID JOKING AND CHAFF EVERYTHING WAS PACKED AND THEN OUT INTO THE BLIZZARD IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ONE'S EYES OPEN THE FINE DRIFT SNOW PENETRATED EVERYWHERE
2843-152918-0012 THE DOGS WERE NOT MUCH INCLINED TO START AND IT TOOK TIME TO GET THEM INTO THEIR HARNESS BUT AT LAST WE WERE READY ONE MORE GLANCE OVER THE CAMPING GROUND TO SEE THAT NOTHING WE OUGHT TO HAVE WITH US HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN
2843-152918-0013 WHICH WE NOW THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WERE LEFT BEHIND THE LAST THING TO BE DONE WAS PLANTING A BROKEN SKI UPRIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE DEPOT IT WAS WISTING WHO DID THIS THINKING PRESUMABLY THAT AN EXTRA MARK WOULD DO NO HARM
2843-152918-0014 THAT IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT THE FUTURE WILL SHOW AND THEN WE WERE OFF IT WAS A HARD PULL TO BEGIN WITH BOTH FOR MEN AND BEASTS AS THE HIGH SASTRUGI CONTINUED TOWARDS THE SOUTH
2843-152918-0015 AND MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ADVANCE THOSE WHO HAD SLEDGES TO DRIVE HAD TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE AND SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY DID NOT CAPSIZE ON THE BIG WAVES AND WE WHO HAD NO SLEDGES FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OUR FEET
2843-152918-0016 AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
2843-152918-0017 IT WAS LIKE DRAGGING ONESELF THROUGH SAND MEANWHILE THE SASTRUGI GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND FINALLY THEY DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND THE SURFACE BECAME QUITE FLAT THE GOING ALSO IMPROVED BY DEGREES
2843-152918-0018 FOR WHAT REASON IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY AS THE STORM CONTINUED UNABATED AND THE DRIFT NOW COMBINED WITH FALLING SNOW WAS THICKER THAN EVER IT WAS ALL THE DRIVER COULD DO TO SEE HIS OWN DOGS THE SURFACE
2843-152918-0019 WHICH HAD BECOME PERFECTLY LEVEL HAD THE APPEARANCE AT TIMES OF SINKING IN ANY CASE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO FROM THE PACE OF THE SLEDGES NOW AND AGAIN THE DOGS WOULD SET OFF SUDDENLY AT A GALLOP THE WIND AFT NO DOUBT HELPED THE PACE SOMEWHAT
2843-152918-0020 BUT IT ALONE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE I DID NOT LIKE THIS TENDENCY OF THE GROUND TO FALL AWAY IN MY OPINION WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AFTER REACHING THE HEIGHT AT WHICH WE WERE A SLIGHT SLOPE UPWARD
2843-152918-0021 POSSIBLY BUT DOWN NO THAT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY RECKONING SO FAR THE INCLINE HAD NOT BEEN SO GREAT AS TO CAUSE UNEASINESS BUT IF IT SERIOUSLY BEGAN TO GO DOWNHILL WE SHOULD HAVE TO STOP AND CAMP
2843-152918-0022 WOULD BE MADNESS WE MIGHT RISK FALLING INTO SOME CHASM BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO PULL UP HANSSEN AS USUAL WAS DRIVING FIRST STRICTLY SPEAKING I SHOULD NOW HAVE BEEN GOING IN ADVANCE BUT THE UNEVEN SURFACE AT THE START
2843-152918-0023 AND THE RAPID PACE AFTERWARDS HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK AS FAST THE DOGS COULD PULL I WAS THEREFORE FOLLOWING BY THE SIDE OF WISTING'S SLEDGE AND CHATTING WITH HIM SUDDENLY I SAW HANSSEN'S DOGS SHOOT AHEAD
2843-152918-0024 AND DOWNHILL THEY WENT AT THE WILDEST PACE WISTING AFTER THEM I SHOUTED TO HANSSEN TO STOP
2843-152918-0025 BY TWISTING HIS SLEDGE THE OTHERS WHO WERE FOLLOWING STOPPED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRLY STEEP DESCENT WHAT THERE MIGHT BE BELOW WAS NOT EASY TO DECIDE NOR WOULD WE TRY TO FIND OUT IN THAT WEATHER
2843-152918-0026 WE TRAMPLED DOWN A PLACE FOR THE TENT IN THE LOOSE SNOW AND SOON GOT IT UP IT WAS NOT A LONG DAY'S MARCH THAT WE HAD DONE ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER MILES BUT WE HAD PUT AN END TO OUR STAY AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND THAT WAS A GREAT THING
2843-152918-0027 THE BOILING POINT TEST THAT EVENING SHOWED THAT WE WERE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THAT WE HAD THUS GONE DOWN SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FEET FROM THE BUTCHER'S WE TURNED IN AND WENT TO SLEEP AS SOON AS IT BRIGHTENED
2843-152918-0028 ONE HAS TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THESE REGIONS IF ONE NEGLECTS TO DO SO IT MAY MEAN A LONG WAIT AND MUCH MAY BE LOST WE THEREFORE ALL SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN
2843-152918-0029 AND WE KNEW WELL THAT NOTHING COULD HAPPEN WITHOUT OUR NOTICING IT AT THREE IN THE MORNING THE SUN CUT THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND WE THROUGH THE TENT DOOR TO TAKE IN THE SITUATION WAS MORE THAN THE WORK OF A MOMENT
2843-152918-0030 THE SUN SHOWED AS YET LIKE A PAT OF BUTTER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN DISPERSING THE THICK MISTS THE WIND HAD DROPPED SOMEWHAT BUT WAS STILL FAIRLY STRONG THIS IS AFTER ALL THE WORST PART OF ONE'S JOB
2843-152918-0031 TURNING OUT OF ONE'S GOOD WARM SLEEPING BAG AND STANDING OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME IN THIN CLOTHES WATCHING THE WEATHER WE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT A GLEAM LIKE THIS A CLEARING IN THE WEATHER MIGHT COME SUDDENLY AND THEN ONE HAD TO BE ON THE SPOT
2843-152918-0032 THE GLEAM CAME IT DID NOT LAST LONG BUT LONG ENOUGH WE LAY ON THE SIDE OF A RIDGE THAT FELL AWAY PRETTY STEEPLY THE DESCENT ON THE SOUTH WAS TOO ABRUPT BUT ON THE SOUTH EAST IT WAS BETTER AND MORE GRADUAL
2843-152918-0033 AND ENDED IN A WIDE LEVEL TRACT WE COULD SEE NO CREVASSES OR UNPLEASANTNESS OF ANY KIND IT WAS NOT VERY FAR THAT WE COULD SEE THOUGH ONLY OUR NEAREST SURROUNDINGS OF THE MOUNTAINS WE SAW NOTHING
2843-152918-0034 HAD NOW BROKEN LOOSE AGAIN AND THE NORTH EASTER WAS DOING ALL IT COULD
2843-152918-0035 SINCE WE HAD DISCOVERED THE NATURE OF OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS IF WE ONCE GOT DOWN TO THE PLAIN WE KNEW THAT WE COULD ALWAYS FEEL OUR WAY ON AFTER PUTTING AMPLE BRAKES ON THE SLEDGE RUNNERS
2843-152918-0036 WE STARTED OFF DOWNHILL IN A SOUTH EASTERLY DIRECTION THE SLIGHT IDEA OF THE POSITION THAT WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THE MORNING PROVED CORRECT THE DESCENT WAS EASY AND SMOOTH AND WE REACHED THE PLAIN WITHOUT ANY ADVENTURE
2843-152918-0037 WE COULD NOW ONCE MORE SET OUR FACES TO THE SOUTH AND IN THICK DRIVING SNOW WE CONTINUED OUR WAY INTO THE UNKNOWN WITH GOOD ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOWLING NORTH EASTERLY GALE WE NOW RECOMMENCED THE ERECTION OF BEACONS
2843-152918-0038 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY DURING THE ASCENT
2843-152918-0039 THE LAST OF THEM THAT WE ENCOUNTERED THE SURFACE WAS NOW FINE ENOUGH SMOOTH AS A FLOOR AND WITHOUT A SIGN OF SASTRUGI IF OUR PROGRESS WAS NEVERTHELESS SLOW AND DIFFICULT THIS WAS DUE TO THE WRETCHED GOING
2843-152918-0040 WHICH WAS REAL TORTURE TO ALL OF US A SLEDGE JOURNEY THROUGH THE SAHARA COULD NOT HAVE OFFERED A WORSE SURFACE TO MOVE OVER
2843-152918-0041 THE WEATHER IMPROVED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND WHEN WE CAMPED IN THE AFTERNOON IT LOOKED QUITE SMILING THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND GAVE A DELIGHTFUL WARMTH AFTER THE LAST FEW BITTER DAYS IT WAS NOT YET CLEAR
2843-152918-0042 SO THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING OF OUR SURROUNDINGS THE DISTANCE ACCORDING TO OUR THREE SLEDGE METERS WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES TAKING THE BAD GOING INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAD REASON TO BE WELL SATISFIED WITH IT
2843-152918-0043 OUR ALTITUDE CAME OUT AT NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA OR A DROP OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FEET IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THIS SURPRISED ME GREATLY WHAT DID IT MEAN
2843-152918-0044 INSTEAD OF RISING GRADUALLY WE WERE GOING SLOWLY DOWN
2843-152918-0045 BUT WHAT ACCORDING TO DEAD RECKONING OUR LATITUDE THAT EVENING
2843-152918-0046 THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH SHARP GUSTS FROM THE NORTH THE MORNING CAME WITH A SLACK WIND BUT ACCOMPANIED BY MIST AND SNOWFALL THIS WAS ABOMINABLE HERE WE WERE ADVANCING OVER ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN GROUND AND ABLE TO SEE NOTHING
2843-152918-0047 THE SURFACE REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME POSSIBLY RATHER MORE UNDULATING THAT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING HERE AT SOME TIME AND VIOLENTLY TOO WAS SHOWN BY THE UNDER SURFACE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF SASTRUGI AS HARD AS IRON
2843-152918-0048 LUCKILY FOR US THE SNOWFALL OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD FILLED THESE UP SO AS TO PRESENT A LEVEL SURFACE IT WAS HEAVY GOING THOUGH BETTER THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS WE WERE ADVANCING STILL BLINDLY
2843-152918-0049 AND FRETTING AT THE PERSISTENTLY THICK WEATHER ONE OF US SUDDENLY CALLED OUT HULLO LOOK THERE A WILD DARK SUMMIT ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE MASS OF FOG TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY
2843-152918-0050 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THREATENINGLY NEAR AND RIGHT OVER US WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE IMPOSING SIGHT BUT NATURE DID NOT EXPOSE HER OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR LONG THE FOG ROLLED OVER AGAIN THICK HEAVY AND DARK
2843-152918-0051 AND BLOTTED OUT THE VIEW WE KNEW NOW THAT WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR SURPRISES AFTER WE HAD GONE ABOUT TEN MILES THE FOG AGAIN LIFTED FOR A MOMENT AND WE SAW QUITE NEAR A MILE OR SO AWAY
2843-152918-0052 TWO LONG NARROW MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO THE WEST OF US RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH AND COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SNOW THESE
2843-152918-0053 THEY WERE BETWEEN NINE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH AND WOULD PROBABLY SERVE AS EXCELLENT LANDMARKS ON THE RETURN JOURNEY THERE WAS NO CONNECTION TO BE TRACED BETWEEN THESE MOUNTAINS AND THOSE LYING TO THE EAST OF THEM
2843-152918-0054 THEY GAVE US THE IMPRESSION OF BEING ENTIRELY ISOLATED SUMMITS AS WE COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY LOFTY RIDGE RUNNING EAST AND WEST
2843-152918-0055 WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE IN THE CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF FINDING SOME SURPRISE OR OTHER IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE THE AIR AHEAD OF US WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH AS THOUGH IT CONCEALED SOMETHING
2843-152918-0056 IT COULD NOT BE A STORM OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALREADY UPON US BUT WE WENT ON AND ON AND NOTHING CAME OUR DAY'S MARCH WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES I SEE THAT MY DIARY FOR NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
2843-152918-0057 DOES NOT BEGIN VERY PROMISINGLY FOG FOG AND AGAIN FOG ALSO FINE FALLING SNOW WHICH MAKES THE GOING IMPOSSIBLE POOR BEASTS THEY HAVE TOILED HARD TO GET THE SLEDGES FORWARD TO DAY
2843-152918-0058 BUT THE DAY DID NOT TURN OUT SO BADLY AFTER ALL AS WE WORKED OUR WAY OUT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND FOUND OUT WHAT WAS BEHIND THE PITCH DARK CLOUDS DURING THE FORENOON THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND THRUST ASIDE THE FOG FOR A WHILE AND THERE
2843-152918-0059 TO THE SOUTH EAST NOT MANY MILES AWAY LAY AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS FROM THIS MASS RIGHT ACROSS OUR COURSE RAN A GREAT ANCIENT GLACIER THE SUN SHONE DOWN UPON IT AND SHOWED US A SURFACE FULL OF HUGE IRREGULARITIES
2843-152918-0060 ON THE SIDE NEAREST TO THE MOUNTAIN THESE DISTURBANCES WERE SUCH THAT A HASTY GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW US THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADVANCING THAT WAY BUT RIGHT IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE STRAIGHT ON TO THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0061 AND WAITED FOR DECENTLY CLEAR WEATHER SO THAT WE MIGHT SURVEY THE GROUND AT OUR EASE AND CHOOSE THE BEST WAY GOING FORWARD WITHOUT AN IDEA OF WHAT THE GROUND WAS LIKE WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT
2843-152918-0062 BUT HOW LONG SHOULD WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR CLEAR WEATHER THAT QUESTION WAS UNANSWERABLE POSSIBLY A WEEK OR EVEN A FORTNIGHT AND WE HAD NO TIME FOR THAT BETTER GO STRAIGHT ON THEN AND TAKE WHAT MIGHT COME
2843-152918-0063 WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE GLACIER APPEARED TO BE PRETTY STEEP BUT IT WAS ONLY BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST UNDER THE NEW LAND THAT THE FOG NOW AND AGAIN LIFTED SUFFICIENTLY TO ENABLE US TO SEE ANYTHING
2843-152918-0064 WE COULD SEE THAT THE BIG CREVASSES LOST THEMSELVES IN IT AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT THE GLACIER LOOKED LIKE ON THE WEST
2843-152918-0065 IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE STIFF WORK IT WAS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ON THE SLEDGES WE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO BUILD THE DEPOT THE SNOW HERE WAS EXCELLENT FOR THIS PURPOSE
2843-152918-0066 AS HARD AS GLASS IN A SHORT TIME AN IMMENSE ERECTION OF ADAMANTINE BLOCKS OF SNOW ROSE INTO THE AIR CONTAINING PROVISIONS FOR FIVE MEN FOR SIX DAYS AND FOR EIGHTEEN DOGS FOR FIVE DAYS
2843-152918-0067 A NUMBER OF SMALL ARTICLES WERE ALSO LEFT BEHIND WHILE WE WERE THUS OCCUPIED THE FOG HAD BEEN COMING AND GOING SOME OF THE INTERVALS HAD BEEN QUITE CLEAR AND HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD VIEW OF THE NEAREST PART OF THE RANGE
2843-152918-0068 IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE ISOLATED AND TO CONSIST OF FOUR MOUNTAINS ONE OF THESE MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN LAY SEPARATED FROM THE REST THE OTHER THREE MOUNTS OSCAR WISTING
2843-152918-0069 AND OLAV BJAALAND LAY CLOSER TOGETHER BEHIND THIS GROUP THE AIR HAD BEEN HEAVY AND BLACK THE WHOLE TIME SHOWING THAT MORE LAND MUST BE CONCEALED THERE SUDDENLY
2843-152918-0070 AND THE SUMMITS OF A COLOSSAL MOUNTAIN MASS APPEARED OUR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THIS MOUNTAIN MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN MUST BE SOMETHING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FEET HIGH IT POSITIVELY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY
2843-152918-0071 SO FORMIDABLE DID IT APPEAR BUT IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE THAT WE HAD AND THEN THE FOG ENCLOSED IT ONCE MORE WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING A FEW MEAGRE BEARINGS OF THE DIFFERENT SUMMITS OF THE NEAREST GROUP
2843-152918-0072 THEY WERE NOT VERY GRAND BUT BETTER ONES WERE NOT TO BE OBTAINED FOR THAT MATTER THE SITE OF THE DEPOT WAS SO WELL MARKED BY ITS POSITION UNDER THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER THAT WE AGREED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS IT
2843-152918-0073 HAVING FINISHED THE EDIFICE WHICH ROSE AT LEAST SIX FEET INTO THE AIR
2843-152918-0074 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL MORE EASILY ON THE WAY BACK AN OBSERVATION WE HAD CONTRIVED TO TAKE WHILE THE WORK WAS IN PROGRESS
2843-152918-0075 THIS DID NOT AGREE VERY WELL WITH THE LATITUDE OF OUR DEAD RECKONING
2843-152918-0076 AND A FINE LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING WE HAD TAKEN A BEARING OF THE LINE OF GLACIER THAT WAS MOST FREE OF CREVASSES AND SO WE MOVED ON AGAIN
2843-152918-0077 THE CREVASSES AT ITS FOOT WERE NOT LARGE BUT WE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED UPON THE ASCENT THAN THE FUN BEGAN THERE WAS SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT THIS PERFECTLY BLIND ADVANCE AMONG CREVASSES AND CHASMS ON ALL SIDES
2843-152918-0078 WE EXAMINED THE COMPASS FROM TIME TO TIME AND WENT FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
2843-152918-0079 BUT THAT AFTER ALL WAS NOT MUCH OF A HELP TO OUR DRIVERS
2843-152918-0080 AS THE CREVASSES WERE OFTEN RENDERED QUITE INVISIBLE BY A THIN OVERLYING LAYER OF SNOW
2843-152918-0081 TO HAVE TO CROSS SUCH A SURFACE AS THE EFFECT OF LIGHT AND SHADE IS USUALLY TO SHOW UP THE EDGES OF THESE INSIDIOUS PITFALLS BUT ON A DAY LIKE THIS WHEN EVERYTHING LOOKED ALIKE ONE'S ADVANCE IS DOUBTFUL WE KEPT IT GOING HOWEVER
2843-152918-0082 BY USING THE UTMOST CAUTION WISTING CAME NEAR TO SOUNDING THE DEPTH OF ONE OF THESE DANGEROUS CREVASSES WITH SLEDGE DOGS AND ALL AS THE BRIDGE HE WAS ABOUT TO CROSS GAVE WAY THANKS TO HIS PRESENCE OF MIND
2843-152918-0083 AND A LIGHTNING LIKE MOVEMENT SOME WOULD CALL IT LUCK HE MANAGED TO SAVE HIMSELF IN THIS WAY WE WORKED UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET BUT THEN WE CAME UPON SUCH A LABYRINTH OF YAWNING CHASMS AND OPEN ABYSSES
2843-152918-0084 THAT WE COULD NOT MOVE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO FIND THE LEAST DISTURBED SPOT AND SET THE TENT THERE AS SOON AS THIS WAS DONE HANSSEN AND I SET OUT TO EXPLORE WE WERE ROPED AND THEREFORE SAFE ENOUGH
2843-152918-0085 IT REQUIRED SOME STUDY TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE TRAP WE HAD RUN OURSELVES INTO TOWARDS THE GROUP OF MOUNTAINS LAST DESCRIBED WHICH NOW LAY TO THE EAST OF US
2843-152918-0086 IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND EVOKED A PICTURE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION THANK GOD WE WERE NOT HERE WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I STOOD LOOKING OUT OVER THIS BATTLEFIELD IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECTACLE LIKE DOOMSDAY
2843-152918-0087 AND NOT ON A SMALL SCALE EITHER TO ADVANCE IN THAT DIRECTION THEN WAS HOPELESS BUT THAT WAS NO GREAT MATTER SINCE OUR WAY WAS TO THE SOUTH ON THE SOUTH WE COULD SEE NOTHING THE FOG LAY THICK AND HEAVY THERE
2843-152918-0088 THIS RIDGE LED US ON TO AN ICEWAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH A FORMATION WHICH WAS DUE TO THE PRESSURE HAVING CEASED BEFORE THE WAVE HAD BEEN FORCED TO BREAK AND FORM HUMMOCKS
2843-152918-0089 WE SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT PLACE TO PASS WITH SLEDGES AND DOGS BUT IN DEFAULT OF ANYTHING BETTER IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE FROM THE TOP OF THIS WAVE FORMATION WE COULD SEE DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE
2843-152918-0090 WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN HIDDEN FROM US THE FOG PREVENTED OUR SEEING FAR BUT THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS WERE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE US THAT WITH CAUTION WE COULD BEAT UP FARTHER FROM THE HEIGHT ON WHICH WE STOOD
2843-152918-0091 AS WE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUR OBJECT WAS TO MAKE TRACKS FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY'S JOURNEY THE LANGUAGE WE USED ABOUT THE GLACIER AS WE WENT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLIMENTARY WE HAD ENDLESS TACKING AND TURNING TO GET ON
2843-152918-0092 A FISSURE HAD OPENED MAKING A GATEWAY ABOUT SIX FEET WIDE THIS FORMATION LIKE EVERY THING ELSE ON THE GLACIER WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY OLD AND FOR THE MOST PART FILLED WITH SNOW
2843-152918-0093 FROM THIS POINT THE GLACIER AS FAR AS OUR VIEW EXTENDED TO THE SOUTH LOOKED BETTER AND BETTER
2843-152918-0094 OUR COMPANIONS WERE NO LESS PLEASED WITH THE NEWS WE BROUGHT OF OUR PROSPECTS OUR ALTITUDE THAT EVENING WAS EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THAT IS TO SAY AT THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0095 WE HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FEET OR A DROP FROM THE BUTCHER'S OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FEET WE NOW KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS ASCENT TO MAKE AGAIN PERHAPS EVEN MORE
2843-152918-0096 AND THIS IDEA DID NOT AROUSE ANY PARTICULAR ENTHUSIASM IN MY DIARY I SEE THAT I CONCLUDE THE DAY WITH THE FOLLOWING WORDS WHAT WILL THE NEXT SURPRISE BE I WONDER IT WAS IN FACT
2843-152918-0097 AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY THAT WE WERE UNDERTAKING THROUGH NEW REGIONS NEW MOUNTAINS GLACIERS AND SO ON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE
2843-152918-0098 WHAT I LIKED LEAST ABOUT THIS FEELING ONE'S WAY FORWARD IN THE DARK WAS THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO RECOGNIZE THE GROUND AGAIN ON THE WAY BACK BUT WITH THIS GLACIER LYING STRAIGHT ACROSS OUR LINE OF ROUTE
2843-152918-0099 A MISTAKE THERE MIGHT BE SERIOUS ENOUGH AND IT WILL APPEAR LATER IN THIS NARRATIVE THAT MY FEAR OF OUR NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE WAY WAS NOT ENTIRELY GROUNDLESS THE BEACONS WE HAD PUT UP CAME TO OUR AID
2843-152918-0100 AND FOR OUR FINAL SUCCESS WE OWE A DEEP DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO OUR PRUDENCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS IN ADOPTING THIS EXPEDIENT NEXT MORNING NOVEMBER TWENTY NINTH BROUGHT CONSIDERABLY CLEARER WEATHER
2843-152918-0101 AND ALLOWED US A VERY GOOD SURVEY OF OUR POSITION WE COULD NOW SEE THAT THE TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES
2843-152918-0102 WITH SUMMITS FROM TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN WAS THE MOST SOUTHERLY WE COULD SEE FROM THIS POINT MOUNTS HANSSEN WISTING BJAALAND AND HASSEL FORMED AS WE HAD THOUGHT THE DAY BEFORE
2843-152918-0103 A GROUP BY THEMSELVES AND LAY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN RANGE THE DRIVERS HAD A WARM MORNING'S WORK THEY HAD TO DRIVE WITH GREAT CIRCUMSPECTION AND PATIENCE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE KIND OF GROUND WE HAD BEFORE US
2843-152918-0104 A SLIGHT MISTAKE MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO SEND BOTH SLEDGE AND DOGS WITH LIGHTNING RAPIDITY INTO THE NEXT WORLD IT TOOK NEVERTHELESS A REMARKABLY SHORT TIME TO COVER THE DISTANCE WE HAD EXPLORED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING BEFORE WE KNEW IT
2843-152918-0105 WE WERE AT HELL'S GATE BJAALAND TOOK AN EXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPH HERE WHICH GIVES A VERY GOOD IDEA OF THE DIFFICULTIES THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY PRESENTED IN THE FOREGROUND
2843-152918-0106 BELOW THE HIGH SNOW RIDGE THAT FORMS ONE SIDE OF A VERY WIDE BUT PARTLY FILLED UP CREVASSE THE MARKS OF SKI CAN BE SEEN IN THE SNOW THIS WAS THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO IN PASSING OVER THIS SNOW BRIDGE
2843-152918-0107 STRUCK HIS SKI INTO IT TO TRY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUPPORT CLOSE TO THE TRACKS CAN BE SEEN AN OPEN PIECE OF THE CREVASSE IT IS A PALE BLUE AT THE TOP BUT ENDS IN THE DEEPEST BLACK IN A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS
2843-152918-0108 THE PHOTOGRAPHER GOT OVER THE BRIDGE AND BACK WITH A WHOLE SKIN BUT THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF RISKING SLEDGES AND DOGS ON IT AND IT CAN BE SEEN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT THE SLEDGES HAVE BEEN TURNED RIGHT ROUND TO TRY ANOTHER WAY
2843-152918-0109 BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE TURNS AND CIRCUITS WE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO MAKE IT WAS NOT SO SHORT AFTER ALL WE SET OUR TENT ON A GOOD SOLID FOUNDATION AND WERE WELL PLEASED WITH THE DAY'S WORK
2843-152918-0110 THE ALTITUDE WAS EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THE SUN WAS NOW IN THE WEST AND SHINING DIRECTLY UPON THE HUGE MOUNTAIN MASSES IT WAS A FAIRY LANDSCAPE IN BLUE AND WHITE
2843-152918-0111 CLEAR AS IT NOW APPEARED TO BE ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE WEATHER WAS NOT ALL THAT COULD BE WISHED FOR THE SOUTH EASTERN END OF MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN LOST ITSELF IN A DARK IMPENETRABLE CLOUD
2843-152918-0112 WHICH LED ONE TO SUSPECT A CONTINUATION IN THAT DIRECTION THOUGH ONE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN MOUNT NILSEN AH ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL TAKING IT ALTOGETHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN
2843-152918-0113 PEAKS OF THE MOST VARIED FORMS ROSE HIGH INTO THE AIR PARTLY COVERED WITH DRIVING CLOUDS SOME WERE SHARP BUT MOST WERE LONG AND ROUNDED HERE AND THERE ONE SAW BRIGHT SHINING GLACIERS
2843-152918-0114 PLUNGING WILDLY DOWN THE STEEP SIDES AND MERGING INTO THE UNDERLYING GROUND IN FEARFUL CONFUSION BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE OF THEM ALL WAS MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN ITS TOP WAS AS ROUND AS THE BOTTOM OF A BOWL
2843-152918-0115 AND COVERED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ICE SHEET WHICH WAS SO BROKEN UP AND DISTURBED THAT THE BLOCKS OF ICE BRISTLED IN EVERY DIRECTION LIKE THE QUILLS OF A PORCUPINE IT GLITTERED AND BURNED IN THE SUNLIGHT A GLORIOUS SPECTACLE
4267-72637-0000 SHE DURHAM JULY SOMETHING OR OTHER AT FARMER HENDRY'S WE LEFT YORK THIS MORNING AND ARRIVED IN DURHAM ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IT SEEMS THERE IS SOME SORT OF AN ELECTION GOING ON IN THE TOWN
4267-72637-0001 AND THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE FLY AT THE STATION MISTER COPLEY LOOKED ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT NEITHER HORSE NOR VEHICLE WAS TO BE HAD FOR LOVE OR MONEY AT LAST WE STARTED TO WALK TO THE VILLAGE
4267-72637-0002 MISTER COPLEY SO LADEN WITH OUR HAND LUGGAGE THAT HE RESEMBLED A PACK MULE WE CALLED FIRST AT THE THREE TUNS WHERE THEY STILL KEEP UP THE OLD CUSTOM OF GIVING A WEE GLASS OF CHERRY BRANDY TO EACH GUEST ON HIS ARRIVAL BUT ALAS
4267-72637-0003 THEY WERE CROWDED AND WE WERE TURNED FROM THE HOSPITABLE DOOR WE THEN MADE A TOUR OF THE INNS BUT NOT A SINGLE ROOM WAS TO BE HAD NOT FOR THAT NIGHT NOR FOR TWO DAYS AHEAD ON ACCOUNT OF THAT SAME ELECTION HADN'T WE BETTER GO ON TO EDINBURGH
4267-72637-0004 I ASKED AS WE WERE RESTING IN THE DOOR OF THE JOLLY SAILOR EDINBURGH NEVER SHE REPLIED
4267-72637-0005 AND WRITE UP A RECORD OF OUR ENTIRE TRIP FROM WINCHESTER WHILE THE IMPRESSIONS WERE FRESH IN MY MIND
4267-72637-0006 SAID MISTER COPLEY THAT IS I HOPED TO FINISH OFF MY PREVIOUS SKETCHES WHICH ARE IN A FRIGHTFUL STATE OF INCOMPLETION AND SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF TIME ON THE INTERIOR OF THIS CATHEDRAL WHICH IS UNUSUALLY BEAUTIFUL
4267-72637-0007 IN HER OPINION THE CONSTANT CONSUMPTION OF MALT LIQUORS PREVENTS A MORE DANGEROUS INDULGENCE IN BRANDY AND WHISKY SHE IS GATHERING STATISTICS BUT AS THE BARMAIDS CAN NEVER COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS WHILE THEY ARE DRAWING ALE
4267-72637-0008 FOR MY PART SAID I WITH MOCK HUMILITY I AM A DOCILE PERSON WHO NEVER HAS ANY INTENTIONS OF HER OWN BUT WHO YIELDS HERSELF SWEETLY TO THE INTENTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY ARE YOU
4267-72637-0009 ASKED MISTER COPLEY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL YES I SAID SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING MERELY TAKING NOTE OF YOUR STATEMENT THAT'S ALL NOW MISS VAN TYCK
4267-72637-0010 I HAVE A PLAN TO PROPOSE I WAS HERE LAST SUMMER WITH A COUPLE OF HARVARD MEN AND WE LODGED AT A FARMHOUSE ABOUT A MILE DISTANT FROM THE CATHEDRAL IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE COFFEE ROOM FOR AN HOUR
4267-72637-0011 I'LL WALK UP TO FARMER HENDRY'S AND SEE IF THEY WILL TAKE US IN I THINK WE MIGHT BE FAIRLY COMFORTABLE CAN AUNT CELIA HAVE APOLLINARIS AND BLACK COFFEE AFTER HER MORNING BATH I ASKED I HOPE KATHARINE
4267-72637-0012 IF MISTER COPLEY CAN SECURE APARTMENTS FOR US I SHALL BE MORE THAN GRATEFUL SO HERE WE ARE ALL LODGING TOGETHER IN AN IDEAL ENGLISH FARMHOUSE
4267-72637-0013 AND THE BUTTER AND CREAM AND EGGS AND MUTTON ARE DELICIOUS AND I NEVER NEVER WANT TO GO HOME ANY MORE I WANT TO LIVE HERE FOR EVER AND WAVE THE AMERICAN FLAG ON WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
4267-72637-0014 I AM SO HAPPY THAT I FEEL AS IF SOMETHING WERE GOING TO SPOIL IT ALL TWENTY YEARS OLD TO DAY I WISH MAMMA WERE ALIVE TO WISH ME MANY HAPPY RETURNS THE CATHEDRAL IS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF
4267-72637-0015 AND ITS SITUATION IS BEYOND ALL WORDS OF MINE TO DESCRIBE I GREATLY ADMIRED THE PULPIT WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY FIVE PILLARS SUNK INTO THE BACKS OF SQUASHED LIONS BUT MISTER COPLEY WHEN I ASKED HIM THE PERIOD SAID PURE BRUMMAGEM
4267-72637-0016 NOT JENNY WREN CHRISTOPHER ARCHITECTURE HAS HAD IN ENGLAND ESPECIALLY NO LEGITIMATE DEVELOPMENT THIS IS THE ONLY CATHEDRAL WITH A BISHOP'S THRONE OR A SANCTUARY KNOCKER HE

4267-72637-0022 AND WHEN SHE LOOKS UP I AM NEVER READY FOR HER TO LOOK DOWN IF IT HAD BEEN A SECULAR OCCASION AND SHE HAD DROPPED HER HANDKERCHIEF SEVEN EIGHTHS OF THE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE STARTED TO PICK IT UP BUT I SHOULD HAVE GOT THERE FIRST WELL
4267-72637-0023 FOR THERE ARE FACTS TO BE CONSIDERED DELIGHTFUL WARM BREATHING FACTS WE WERE COMING HOME FROM EVENSONG KITTY AND I I AM ANTICIPATING FOR SHE WAS STILL MISS SCHUYLER THEN BUT NEVER MIND
4267-72637-0024 WE WERE WALKING THROUGH THE FIELDS WHILE MISSUS BENEDICT AND AUNT CELIA WERE DRIVING AS WE CAME ACROSS A CORNER OF THE BIT OF MEADOW LAND THAT JOINS THE STABLE AND THE GARDEN WE HEARD A MUFFLED ROAR
4267-72637-0025 AND AS WE LOOKED AROUND WE SAW A CREATURE WITH TOSSING HORNS AND WAVING TAIL MAKING FOR US HEAD DOWN EYES FLASHING KITTY GAVE A SHRIEK WE CHANCED TO BE NEAR A PAIR OF LOW BARS I HADN'T BEEN A COLLEGE ATHLETE FOR NOTHING
4267-72637-0026 FLUNG HERSELF BODILY INTO MY ARMS CRYING JACK JACK SAVE ME IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD CALLED ME JACK AND I NEEDED NO SECOND INVITATION I PROCEEDED TO SAVE HER IN THE USUAL WAY

4267-72637-0031 I DID NOT FACILITATE THE PREPARATIONS AND A MOMENT OF AWKWARD SILENCE ENSUED MIGHT I INQUIRE I ASKED IF THE DEAR LITTLE PERSON AT PRESENT REPOSING IN MY ARMS WILL STAY THERE WITH INTERVALS FOR REST AND REFRESHMENT
4267-72637-0032 FOR THE REST OF HER NATURAL LIFE SHE WITHDREW ENTIRELY NOW ALL BUT HER HAND AND HER EYES SOUGHT THE GROUND I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO THAT IS IF YOU THINK AT LEAST I SUPPOSE YOU DO THINK
4267-72637-0033 SHE REPLIED I WAS FRIGHTENED WITHIN AN INCH OF MY LIFE I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING THAT I WAS DREADFULLY AFRAID OF BULLS ESPECIALLY MAD ONES AND I TOLD YOU THAT MY NURSE FRIGHTENED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD WITH AWFUL STORIES ABOUT THEM

4267-72637-0035 SHE CRIED PUTTING HER HAND OVER MY LIPS AND GETTING IT WELL KISSED IN CONSEQUENCE
4267-78186-0000 AS WE APPROACHED THE INN AT AMHERST THE CLOCKMAKER GREW UNEASY IT'S PRETTY WELL ON IN THE EVENING I GUESS SAID HE AND MARM PUGWASH IS AS ONSARTIN IN HER TEMPER AS A MORNIN IN APRIL
4267-78186-0001 IT'S ALL SUNSHINE OR ALL CLOUDS WITH HER AND IF SHE'S IN ONE OF HER TANTRUMS SHE'LL STRETCH OUT HER NECK AND HISS LIKE A GOOSE WITH A FLOCK OF GOSLIN'S
4267-78186-0002 THE OLD MINISTER HAD AN ORCHARD OF MOST PARTICULAR GOOD FRUIT FOR HE WAS A GREAT HAND AT BUDDIN GRAFTIN AND WHAT NOT AND THE ORCHARD IT WAS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE STRETCHED RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD WELL
4267-78186-0003 THERE WERE SOME TREES HUNG OVER THE FENCE I NEVER SEED SUCH BEARERS THE APPLES HUNG IN ROPES FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE STRINGS OF ONIONS AND THE FRUIT WAS BEAUTIFUL NOBODY TOUCHED THE MINISTER'S APPLES
4267-78186-0004 SO I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY MINISTER SAID I HOW ON AIRTH DO YOU MANAGE TO KEEP YOUR FRUIT THAT'S SO EXPOSED WHEN NO ONE ELSE CAN'T DO IT NOHOW WHY SAYS HE THEY ARE DREADFULLY PRETTY FRUIT AIN'T THEY

4267-78186-0006 THE BOYS THINK THE OLD MINISTER'S GRAFTIN HAS ALL SUCCEEDED ABOUT AS WELL AS THAT ROW
4267-78186-0007 IF PUGWASH HAD A WATERY MOUTH WHEN HE MARRIED I GUESS IT'S PRETTY PUCKERY BY THIS TIME HOWEVER IF SHE GOES TO ACT UGLY

4267-78186-0010 AND ON OPENING THE OPPOSITE DOOR INTO THE SITTING ROOM WE FOUND THE FEMALE PART OF THE FAMILY EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE FOR THE NIGHT MISSUS PUGWASH HAD A BROOM IN HER HAND AND WAS IN THE ACT THE LAST ACT OF FEMALE HOUSEWIFERY OF SWEEPING THE HEARTH
4267-78186-0011 THE STRONG FLICKERING LIGHT OF THE FIRE AS IT FELL UPON HER TALL FINE FIGURE AND BEAUTIFUL FACE REVEALED A CREATURE WORTHY OF THE CLOCKMAKER'S COMMENTS GOOD EVENING MARM SAID MISTER SLICK HOW DO YOU DO

669-129074-0000 WHICH CONTAINS BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS WHATEVER BECKY'S PRIVATE PLAN MIGHT BE BY WHICH DOBBIN'S TRUE LOVE WAS TO BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
669-129074-0001 THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT THAT THE SECRET MIGHT KEEP AND INDEED BEING BY NO MEANS SO MUCH INTERESTED
669-129074-0002 SHE HAD A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS PERTAINING TO HERSELF TO CONSIDER AND WHICH CONCERNED HER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MAJOR DOBBIN'S HAPPINESS IN THIS LIFE
669-129074-0003 SHE FOUND HERSELF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY IN SNUG COMFORTABLE QUARTERS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS KINDNESS AND GOOD NATURED SIMPLE PEOPLE
669-129074-0004 AND SAY HIS PRAYERS IN THE MOSQUES
669-129074-0005 SHE PICKETED HER STEED HUNG UP HER WEAPONS AND WARMED HERSELF COMFORTABLY BY HIS FIRE THE HALT IN THAT ROVING RESTLESS LIFE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY SOOTHING AND PLEASANT TO HER
669-129074-0006 OF AMELIA HE DROVE OUT WITH BECKY IN HIS OPEN CARRIAGE HE ASKED LITTLE PARTIES AND INVENTED FESTIVITIES TO DO HER HONOUR TAPEWORM
669-129074-0007 CAME TO DINE WITH JOS AND THEN CAME EVERY DAY TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO BECKY POOR EMMY WHO WAS NEVER VERY TALKATIVE AND MORE GLUM AND SILENT THAN EVER AFTER DOBBIN'S DEPARTURE WAS QUITE FORGOTTEN
669-129074-0008 THERE HEARD OF HER FASCINATIONS AND WERE QUITE CURIOUS TO KNOW HER WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT SHE WAS NOBLE OF AN ANCIENT ENGLISH FAMILY THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A COLONEL OF THE GUARD
669-129074-0009 AND THE LADIES WERE EVEN MORE READY TO CALL HER DU
669-129074-0010 THAN THEY HAD BEEN TO BESTOW THE SAME INESTIMABLE BENEFITS UPON AMELIA LOVE AND LIBERTY ARE INTERPRETED BY THOSE SIMPLE GERMANS IN A WAY WHICH HONEST FOLKS
669-129074-0011 SHE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THE HOUSE AND SHE MADE JOS BELIEVE THAT IT WAS HIS OWN GREAT SOCIAL TALENTS AND WIT
669-129074-0012 AS FOR EMMY WHO FOUND HERSELF NOT IN THE LEAST MISTRESS OF HER OWN HOUSE EXCEPT WHEN THE BILLS WERE TO BE PAID BECKY SOON DISCOVERED THE WAY TO SOOTHE AND PLEASE HER
669-129074-0013 SHE TALKED TO HER PERPETUALLY ABOUT MAJOR DOBBIN SENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER ADMIRATION FOR THAT EXCELLENT HIGH MINDED GENTLEMAN
669-129074-0014 AND TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS HIM WHOM SHE HAD HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MARRY WAS MARRIED FOREVER BUT SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO HEAR THE MAJOR PRAISED
669-129074-0015 AND INDEED BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THE DOBBIN SUBJECT A SCORE OF TIMES EVERY DAY MEANS WERE EASILY FOUND TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF GEORGY AND THE SERVANTS AMELIA'S MAID
669-129074-0016 IT HAS BEEN SAID WAS HEART AND SOUL IN FAVOUR OF THE GENEROUS MAJOR HAVING AT FIRST DISLIKED BECKY FOR BEING THE MEANS OF DISMISSING HIM FROM THE PRESENCE OF HER MISTRESS
669-129074-0017 SHE WAS RECONCILED TO MISSUS CRAWLEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE THE LATTER BECAME WILLIAM'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRER AND CHAMPION AND IN THOSE NIGHTLY CONCLAVES IN WHICH THE TWO LADIES INDULGED AFTER THEIR PARTIES
669-129074-0018 AND WHILE MISS PAYNE WAS BRUSHING THEIR AIRS
669-129074-0019 AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT OF NIGHTS IT NO LONGER REPROACHED HER PERHAPS SHE REPROACHED IT NOW WILLIAM WAS GONE EMMY WAS NOT VERY HAPPY AFTER HER HEROIC SACRIFICE
669-129074-0020 SHE WAS VERY DISTRAITE NERVOUS SILENT AND ILL TO PLEASE THE FAMILY HAD NEVER KNOWN HER SO PEEVISH SHE GREW PALE AND ILL
669-129074-0021 WAS ONE OF THEM THAT TENDER LOVE SONG OF WEBER'S WHICH IN OLD FASHIONED DAYS YOUNG LADIES AND WHEN YOU WERE SCARCELY BORN SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO LIVED BEFORE YOU KNEW
669-129074-0022 TOO HOW TO LOVE AND TO SING CERTAIN SONGS I SAY TO WHICH THE MAJOR WAS PARTIAL
669-129074-0023 SHE WOULD BREAK OFF IN THE MIDST OF THE SONG
669-129074-0024 RUMMAGING HIS MOTHER'S DESK SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FOUND THE GLOVES NEATLY FOLDED UP
669-129074-0025 DURING WHICH REBECCA WAS LEFT TO THE SOCIETY OF MISTER JOSEPH
669-129074-0026 IN A WAY WHICH EVEN MADE THE BOY SMILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE THOUGHT MAJOR WILLIAM WAS THE BEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD THE GENTLEST AND THE KINDEST THE BRAVEST AND THE HUMBLEST
669-129074-0027 OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE TOLD HIM HOW THEY OWED EVERYTHING WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE WORLD TO THAT KIND FRIEND'S BENEVOLENT CARE OF THEM HOW HE HAD BEFRIENDED THEM ALL THROUGH THEIR POVERTY AND MISFORTUNES
669-129074-0028 WATCHED OVER THEM WHEN NOBODY CARED FOR THEM HOW ALL HIS COMRADES ADMIRED HIM THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS OWN GALLANT ACTIONS HOW GEORGY'S FATHER TRUSTED HIM BEYOND ALL OTHER MEN
669-129074-0029 AND HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY BEFRIENDED BY THE GOOD WILLIAM WHY WHEN YOUR PAPA WAS A LITTLE BOY SHE SAID HE OFTEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS WILLIAM WHO DEFENDED HIM AGAINST A TYRANT AT THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE
669-129074-0030 AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP NEVER CEASED FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST WHEN YOUR DEAR FATHER FELL DID DOBBIN KILL THE MAN WHO KILLED PAPA
669-129074-0031 WHEN I'M IN THE ARMY WON'T I HATE THE FRENCH THAT'S ALL
233-155990-0000 THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0001 THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO WORK THAN THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIGH HONOR IS DUE THOSE SERENE AND LOFTY SOULS WHO WITH WISDOM AND COURAGE
233-155990-0002 WITH HIGH IDEALISM TEMPERED BY SANE FACING OF THE ACTUAL FACTS OF LIFE HAVE STRIVEN TO BRING NEARER THE DAY WHEN ARMED STRIFE BETWEEN NATION AND NATION BETWEEN CLASS AND CLASS
233-155990-0003 BETWEEN MAN AND MAN SHALL END THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE ALL THIS IS TRUE IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE ARE NO MEN MORE IGNOBLE OR MORE FOOLISH NO MEN WHOSE ACTIONS ARE FRAUGHT WITH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF MISCHIEF
233-155990-0004 TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
233-155990-0005 WHO WERE INCAPABLE OF OPPRESSING THE WEAK OR OF PERMITTING THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR CONSENT TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO DRAW THE SWORD WHEN TO LEAVE IT UNDRAWN MEANT INABILITY TO ARREST TRIUMPHANT WRONG
233-155990-0006 YET EVERY MAN IN ACTIVE AFFAIRS WHO ALSO READS ABOUT THE PAST GROWS BY BITTER EXPERIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN ILL BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN WELL
233-155990-0007 WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
233-155990-0008 WHO HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF OBTAINING UNIVERSAL PEACE BY SOME CHEAP PATENT PANACEA THERE HAS BEEN A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH
233-155990-0009 IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
233-155990-0010 AND THAT IN MOST CASES WAR IS AN EVIL METHOD OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES BUT AS YET THERE HAS BEEN ONLY A RUDIMENTARY BEGINNING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS OF JUSTICE
233-155990-0011 AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT AT ALL OF ANY INTERNATIONAL POLICE POWER NOW AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE WHOLE FABRIC OF MUNICIPAL LAW OF LAW WITHIN EACH NATION
233-155990-0012 RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON THE JUDGE AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE POLICEMAN AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE JUDGE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PREVENTS THERE BEING AS YET ANY REAL HOMOLOGY
233-155990-0013 BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW MOREOVER THE QUESTIONS WHICH SOMETIMES INVOLVE NATIONS IN WAR ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX THAN ANY QUESTIONS THAT AFFECT MERELY INDIVIDUALS
233-155990-0014 ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
233-155990-0015 AS MATTERS BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DECIDED DURING THE LAST CENTURY AT LEAST HALF OF THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT HAVE BEEN CIVIL AND NOT FOREIGN WARS THERE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH HABITUALLY COMMIT EITHER UPON OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0016 OR UPON SECTIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE WRONGS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL PERSONS IN GOING TO WAR THERE ARE ALSO WEAK NATIONS SO UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
233-155990-0017 EITHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR OWN CITIZENS OR TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AGAINST FOREIGNERS THAT IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SHEER DUTY FOR SOME OUTSIDE POWER TO INTERFERE IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
233-155990-0018 AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
233-155990-0019 THE WORST INFAMIES OF MODERN TIMES SUCH AFFAIRS AS THE MASSACRES OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED IN A TIME OF NOMINALLY PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
233-155990-0020 WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERT OF BIG POWERS TO PREVENT THE BREAKING OF THIS PEACE ALTHOUGH ONLY BY BREAKING IT COULD THE OUTRAGES BE STOPPED BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFERED BY THESE HIDEOUS MASSACRES WHO SAW THEIR WOMEN VIOLATED
233-155990-0021 OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSACRED FOR IF THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS IN TURKEY HAD BEEN ARMED AND HAD BEEN EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF THEIR ARMS NO MOB WOULD HAVE MEDDLED WITH THEM
233-155990-0022 YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
233-155990-0023 AND THEIR ABANDONMENT OF THEIR ARMED FORCES OR ELSE THEY WRITE WELL MEANING SOLEMN LITTLE BOOKS OR PAMPHLETS OR EDITORIALS AND ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS TO SHOW
233-155990-0024 BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE THIS IS PRECISELY LIKE ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD DISBAND THE POLICE AND DEVOTE OUR SOLE ATTENTION TO PERSUADING CRIMINALS
233-155990-0025 SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
233-155990-0026 THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
233-155990-0027 FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0028 AS AMERICANS THEIR FOLLY IS PECULIARLY SCANDALOUS BECAUSE IF THE PRINCIPLES THEY NOW UPHOLD ARE RIGHT IT MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND BETTER THAT
233-155990-0029 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE PEACEFULLY SUBMITTED TO SEEING THEIR COUNTRY SPLIT INTO HALF A DOZEN JANGLING CONFEDERACIES AND SLAVERY MADE PERPETUAL IF UNWILLING TO LEARN FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY
233-155990-0030 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN CHINA HAS NEITHER A FLEET NOR AN EFFICIENT ARMY IT IS A HUGE CIVILIZED EMPIRE ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS ON THE GLOBE AND IT HAS BEEN THE HELPLESS PREY
233-155990-0031 OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
233-155990-0032 RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
233-155990-0033 REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
233-155990-0034 THE CHIEF TROUBLE COMES FROM THE ENTIRE INABILITY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING THINGS THAT ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WHEN THEY DEMAND PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND ALSO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0035 I REMEMBER ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR NUMBER WHO USED TO WRITE LITTLE SONNETS ON BEHALF OF THE MAHDI AND THE SUDANESE THESE SONNETS SETTING FORTH THE NEED THAT THE SUDAN SHOULD BE BOTH INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL
233-155990-0036 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SUDAN VALUED INDEPENDENCE ONLY BECAUSE IT DESIRED TO WAR AGAINST ALL CHRISTIANS AND TO CARRY ON AN UNLIMITED SLAVE TRADE
233-155990-0037 UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
233-155990-0038 THE POPULATION DECREASED BY NEARLY TWO THIRDS AND PRACTICALLY ALL THE CHILDREN DIED PEACE CAME WELL BEING CAME FREEDOM FROM RAPE AND MURDER AND TORTURE AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND EVERY BRUTAL GRATIFICATION OF LUST AND GREED CAME
233-155990-0039 ONLY WHEN THE SUDAN LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE AND PASSED UNDER ENGLISH RULE YET THIS WELL MEANING LITTLE SONNETEER SINCERELY FELT THAT HIS VERSES WERE ISSUED IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY
233-155990-0040 LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
233-155990-0041 THE CESSATION OF UP BUILDING THE NAVY AND THE PROMISE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HONOR WITH ALL FOREIGN NATIONS THESE PERSONS WOULD DO NO HARM
233-155990-0042 IF THEY AFFECTED ONLY THEMSELVES MANY OF THEM ARE IN THE ORDINARY RELATIONS OF LIFE GOOD CITIZENS THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER GOOD CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE THAT ENFORCED UNIVERSAL VEGETARIANISM OR ANTI VACCINATION
233-155990-0043 IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
233-155990-0044 IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
233-155990-0045 IT IS NOT THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY ANYTHING THEY WILL STAY AT HOME IN SAFETY AND LEAVE BRAVE MEN TO PAY IN BLOOD AND HONEST MEN TO PAY IN SHAME FOR THEIR FOLLY THE TROUBLE IS THAT OUR POLICY IS APT TO GO IN ZIGZAGS
233-155990-0046 BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
4214-7146-0000 DIANA IS INVITED TO TEA WITH TRAGIC RESULTS OCTOBER WAS A BEAUTIFUL MONTH AT GREEN GABLES
4214-7146-0001 WHEN THE BIRCHES IN THE HOLLOW TURNED AS GOLDEN AS SUNSHINE AND THE MAPLES BEHIND THE ORCHARD WERE ROYAL CRIMSON AND THE WILD CHERRY TREES ALONG THE LANE PUT ON THE LOVELIEST SHADES OF DARK RED AND BRONZY GREEN WHILE THE FIELDS SUNNED THEMSELVES IN AFTERMATHS
4214-7146-0002 ANNE REVELED IN THE WORLD OF COLOR ABOUT HER OH MARILLA SHE EXCLAIMED ONE SATURDAY MORNING COMING DANCING IN WITH HER ARMS FULL OF GORGEOUS BOUGHS

4214-7146-0006 IT WAS DREADFUL OF ME TO FORGET SAID ANNE APOLOGETICALLY BUT THAT WAS THE AFTERNOON I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF A NAME FOR VIOLET VALE

4214-7146-0011 YOU'LL PUT DOWN THE OLD BROWN TEA SET BUT YOU CAN OPEN THE LITTLE YELLOW CROCK OF CHERRY PRESERVES IT'S TIME IT WAS BEING USED ANYHOW I BELIEVE IT'S BEGINNING TO WORK AND YOU CAN CUT SOME FRUIT CAKE AND HAVE SOME OF THE COOKIES AND SNAPS
4214-7146-0012 I CAN JUST IMAGINE MYSELF SITTING DOWN AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND POURING OUT THE TEA SAID ANNE SHUTTING HER EYES ECSTATICALLY AND ASKING DIANA IF SHE TAKES SUGAR I KNOW SHE DOESN'T BUT OF COURSE I'LL ASK HER JUST AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW
4214-7146-0013 AND THEN PRESSING HER TO TAKE ANOTHER PIECE OF FRUIT CAKE AND ANOTHER HELPING OF PRESERVES OH MARILLA IT'S A WONDERFUL SENSATION JUST TO THINK OF IT CAN I TAKE HER INTO THE SPARE ROOM TO LAY OFF HER HAT WHEN SHE COMES AND THEN INTO THE PARLOR TO SIT NO
4214-7146-0014 THE SITTING ROOM WILL DO FOR YOU AND YOUR COMPANY BUT THERE'S A BOTTLE HALF FULL OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL THAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM THE CHURCH SOCIAL THE OTHER NIGHT IT'S ON THE SECOND SHELF OF THE SITTING ROOM CLOSET AND YOU AND DIANA CAN HAVE IT IF YOU LIKE
4214-7146-0015 ANNE FLEW DOWN TO THE HOLLOW PAST THE DRYAD'S BUBBLE AND UP THE SPRUCE PATH TO ORCHARD SLOPE TO ASK DIANA TO TEA AS A RESULT JUST AFTER MARILLA HAD DRIVEN OFF TO CARMODY DIANA CAME OVER DRESSED IN HER SECOND BEST DRESS AND LOOKING EXACTLY AS IT IS PROPER TO LOOK WHEN ASKED OUT TO TEA
4214-7146-0016 AT OTHER TIMES SHE WAS WONT TO RUN INTO THE KITCHEN WITHOUT KNOCKING BUT NOW SHE KNOCKED PRIMLY AT THE FRONT DOOR AND WHEN ANNE DRESSED IN HER SECOND BEST AS PRIMLY OPENED IT BOTH LITTLE GIRLS SHOOK HANDS AS GRAVELY AS IF THEY HAD NEVER MET BEFORE

4214-7146-0020 THEY TASTE TWICE AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER COLOR THE ORCHARD WITH ITS GREAT SWEEPING BOUGHS THAT BENT TO THE GROUND WITH FRUIT PROVED SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE LITTLE GIRLS SPENT MOST OF THE AFTERNOON IN IT
4214-7146-0021 DIANA HAD MUCH TO TELL ANNE OF WHAT WENT ON IN SCHOOL SHE HAD TO SIT WITH GERTIE PYE AND SHE HATED IT
4214-7146-0022 RUBY GILLIS HAD CHARMED ALL HER WARTS AWAY TRUE'S YOU LIVE WITH A MAGIC PEBBLE THAT OLD MARY JOE FROM THE CREEK GAVE HER
4214-7146-0023 CHARLIE SLOANE'S NAME WAS WRITTEN UP WITH EM WHITE'S ON THE PORCH WALL AND EM WHITE WAS AWFUL MAD ABOUT IT SAM BOULTER HAD SASSED MISTER PHILLIPS IN CLASS AND MISTER PHILLIPS WHIPPED HIM AND SAM'S FATHER CAME DOWN TO THE SCHOOL AND DARED MISTER PHILLIPS TO LAY A HAND ON ONE OF HIS CHILDREN AGAIN
4214-7146-0024 AND MATTIE ANDREWS HAD A NEW RED HOOD AND A BLUE CROSSOVER WITH TASSELS ON IT AND THE AIRS SHE PUT ON ABOUT IT WERE PERFECTLY SICKENING AND LIZZIE WRIGHT DIDN'T SPEAK TO MAMIE WILSON BECAUSE MAMIE WILSON'S GROWN UP SISTER HAD CUT OUT LIZZIE WRIGHT'S GROWN UP SISTER WITH HER BEAU
4214-7146-0025 AND EVERYBODY MISSED ANNE SO AND WISHED SHE'S COME TO SCHOOL AGAIN AND GILBERT BLYTHE BUT ANNE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT GILBERT BLYTHE
4214-7146-0026 ANNE LOOKED ON THE SECOND SHELF OF THE ROOM PANTRY BUT THERE WAS NO BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL THERE SEARCH REVEALED IT AWAY BACK ON THE TOP SHELF ANNE PUT IT ON A TRAY AND SET IT ON THE TABLE WITH A TUMBLER
4214-7146-0027 NOW PLEASE HELP YOURSELF DIANA SHE SAID POLITELY I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL HAVE ANY JUST NOW I DON'T FEEL AS IF I WANTED ANY AFTER ALL THOSE APPLES
4214-7146-0028 DIANA POURED HERSELF OUT A TUMBLERFUL LOOKED AT ITS BRIGHT RED HUE ADMIRINGLY AND THEN SIPPED IT DAINTILY THAT'S AWFULLY NICE RASPBERRY CORDIAL ANNE SHE SAID I DIDN'T KNOW RASPBERRY CORDIAL WAS SO NICE
4214-7146-0029 THERE ARE SO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES ON A PERSON'S MIND WHEN THEY'RE KEEPING HOUSE ISN'T THERE
4214-7146-0030 THE TUMBLERFULS WERE GENEROUS ONES AND THE RASPBERRY CORDIAL WAS CERTAINLY VERY NICE THE NICEST I EVER DRANK SAID DIANA IT'S EVER SO MUCH NICER THAN MISSUS LYNDE'S ALTHOUGH SHE BRAGS OF HERS SO MUCH
4214-7146-0031 IT DOESN'T TASTE A BIT LIKE HERS I SHOULD THINK MARILLA'S RASPBERRY CORDIAL WOULD PROB'LY BE MUCH NICER THAN MISSUS LYNDE'S SAID ANNE LOYALLY MARILLA IS A FAMOUS COOK
4214-7146-0032 I WAS THINKING THE LOVELIEST STORY ABOUT YOU AND ME DIANA I THOUGHT YOU WERE DESPERATELY ILL WITH SMALLPOX AND EVERYBODY DESERTED YOU BUT I WENT BOLDLY TO YOUR BEDSIDE AND NURSED YOU BACK TO LIFE
4214-7146-0033 AND THEN I TOOK THE SMALLPOX AND DIED AND I WAS BURIED UNDER THOSE POPLAR TREES IN THE GRAVEYARD AND YOU PLANTED A ROSEBUSH BY MY GRAVE AND WATERED IT WITH YOUR TEARS
4214-7146-0034 OH IT WAS SUCH A PATHETIC TALE DIANA THE TEARS JUST RAINED DOWN OVER MY CHEEKS WHILE I MIXED THE CAKE BUT I FORGOT THE FLOUR AND THE CAKE WAS A DISMAL FAILURE FLOUR IS SO ESSENTIAL TO CAKES YOU KNOW MARILLA WAS
4214-7146-0035 VERY CROSS AND I DON'T WONDER I'M A GREAT TRIAL TO HER SHE WAS TERRIBLY MORTIFIED ABOUT THE PUDDING SAUCE LAST WEEK WE HAD A PLUM PUDDING FOR DINNER ON TUESDAY AND THERE WAS HALF THE PUDDING AND A PITCHERFUL OF SAUCE LEFT OVER
4214-7146-0036 MARILLA SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER DINNER AND TOLD ME TO SET IT ON THE PANTRY SHELF AND COVER IT I MEANT TO COVER IT JUST AS MUCH AS COULD BE DIANA BUT WHEN I CARRIED IT IN I WAS IMAGINING I WAS A NUN OF COURSE I'M A PROTESTANT BUT I IMAGINED I WAS A CATHOLIC
4214-7146-0037 TAKING THE VEIL TO BURY A BROKEN HEART IN CLOISTERED SECLUSION AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT COVERING THE PUDDING SAUCE I THOUGHT OF IT NEXT MORNING AND RAN TO THE PANTRY DIANA
4214-7146-0038 FANCY IF YOU CAN MY EXTREME HORROR AT FINDING A MOUSE DROWNED IN THAT PUDDING SAUCE I LIFTED THE MOUSE OUT WITH A SPOON AND THREW IT OUT IN THE YARD AND THEN I WASHED THE SPOON IN THREE WATERS
4214-7146-0039 BUT WHEN SHE DID COME IN I WAS IMAGINING THAT I WAS A FROST FAIRY GOING THROUGH THE WOODS TURNING THE TREES RED AND YELLOW WHICHEVER THEY WANTED TO BE SO I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE PUDDING SAUCE AGAIN AND MARILLA SENT ME OUT TO PICK APPLES
4214-7146-0040 YOU KNOW THEY ARE VERY STYLISH PEOPLE ESPECIALLY MISSUS CHESTER ROSS
4214-7146-0041 I TRIED TO BE AS POLITE AND DIGNIFIED AS I COULD BE FOR I WANTED MISSUS CHESTER ROSS TO THINK I WAS A LADYLIKE LITTLE GIRL EVEN IF I WASN'T PRETTY EVERYTHING WENT RIGHT UNTIL I SAW MARILLA COMING WITH THE PLUM PUDDING IN ONE HAND AND THE PITCHER OF PUDDING SAUCE WARMED UP IN THE OTHER
4214-7146-0042 DIANA THAT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING AND I JUST STOOD UP IN MY PLACE AND SHRIEKED OUT MARILLA YOU MUSTN'T USE THAT PUDDING SAUCE THERE WAS A MOUSE DROWNED IN IT I FORGOT TO TELL YOU BEFORE
4214-7146-0043 OH DIANA I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT AWFUL MOMENT IF I LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED MISSUS CHESTER ROSS JUST LOOKED AT ME AND I THOUGHT I WOULD SINK THROUGH THE FLOOR WITH MORTIFICATION
4214-7146-0044 SHE IS SUCH A PERFECT HOUSEKEEPER AND FANCY WHAT SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT OF US MARILLA TURNED RED AS FIRE BUT SHE NEVER SAID A WORD THEN SHE JUST CARRIED THAT SAUCE AND PUDDING OUT AND BROUGHT IN SOME STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SHE EVEN OFFERED ME SOME
4214-7146-0045 BUT I COULDN'T SWALLOW A MOUTHFUL IT WAS LIKE HEAPING COALS OF FIRE ON MY HEAD AFTER MISSUS CHESTER ROSS WENT AWAY MARILLA GAVE ME A DREADFUL SCOLDING WHY DIANA WHAT IS THE MATTER DIANA HAD STOOD UP VERY UNSTEADILY THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN PUTTING HER HANDS TO HER HEAD
4214-7146-0046 I'M I'M AWFUL SICK SHE SAID A LITTLE THICKLY I I MUST GO RIGHT HOME OH YOU MUSTN'T DREAM OF GOING HOME WITHOUT YOUR TEA CRIED ANNE IN DISTRESS I'LL GET IT RIGHT OFF I'LL GO AND PUT THE TEA DOWN THIS VERY MINUTE

4214-7146-0050 GOT DIANA'S HAT AND WENT WITH HER AS FAR AS THE BARRY YARD FENCE THEN SHE WEPT ALL THE WAY BACK TO GREEN GABLES WHERE SHE SORROWFULLY PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE RASPBERRY CORDIAL BACK INTO THE PANTRY AND GOT TEA READY FOR MATTHEW AND JERRY WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE
4214-7146-0051 AND AS THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS FROM DAWN TILL DUSK ANNE DID NOT STIR ABROAD FROM GREEN GABLES MONDAY AFTERNOON MARILLA SENT HER DOWN TO MISSUS LYNDE'S ON AN ERRAND IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ANNE CAME FLYING BACK UP THE LANE WITH TEARS ROLLING DOWN HER CHEEKS

4214-7146-0058 ALTHOUGH CERTAIN OF THE STRICTER SORT MISSUS BARRY AMONG THEM DISAPPROVED STRONGLY OF IT AND AT THE SAME TIME MARILLA RECOLLECTED THAT SHE HAD PUT THE BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL DOWN IN THE CELLAR
4214-7146-0059 SHE WENT BACK TO THE KITCHEN WITH THE WINE BOTTLE IN HER HAND HER FACE WAS TWITCHING IN SPITE OF HERSELF ANNE YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A GENIUS FOR GETTING INTO TROUBLE YOU WENT AND GAVE DIANA CURRANT WINE INSTEAD OF RASPBERRY CORDIAL
4214-7146-0060 DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOURSELF I NEVER TASTED IT SAID ANNE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CORDIAL I MEANT TO BE SO SO HOSPITABLE DIANA GOT AWFULLY SICK AND HAD TO GO HOME MISSUS BARRY TOLD MISSUS LYNDE SHE WAS SIMPLY DEAD DRUNK
4214-7146-0061 SHE JUST LAUGHED SILLY LIKE WHEN HER MOTHER ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WENT TO SLEEP AND SLEPT FOR HOURS HER MOTHER SMELLED HER BREATH AND KNEW SHE WAS DRUNK SHE HAD A FEARFUL HEADACHE ALL DAY YESTERDAY MISSUS BARRY IS SO INDIGNANT
4214-7146-0062 SHE WILL NEVER BELIEVE BUT WHAT I DID IT ON PURPOSE I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD BETTER PUNISH DIANA FOR BEING SO GREEDY AS TO DRINK THREE GLASSFULS OF ANYTHING SAID MARILLA SHORTLY WHY THREE OF THOSE BIG GLASSES WOULD HAVE MADE HER SICK EVEN IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN CORDIAL
4214-7146-0063 WELL THIS STORY WILL BE A NICE HANDLE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE SO DOWN ON ME FOR MAKING CURRANT WINE ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T MADE ANY FOR THREE YEARS EVER SINCE I FOUND OUT THAT THE MINISTER DIDN'T APPROVE I JUST KEPT THAT BOTTLE FOR SICKNESS
4214-7146-0064 THERE THERE CHILD DON'T CRY I CAN'T SEE AS YOU WERE TO BLAME ALTHOUGH I'M SORRY IT HAPPENED SO I MUST CRY SAID ANNE MY HEART IS BROKEN THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES FIGHT AGAINST ME MARILLA DIANA AND I ARE PARTED FOREVER OH MARILLA
4214-7146-0065 MISSUS BARRY WILL THINK BETTER OF IT WHEN SHE FINDS YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME I SUPPOSE SHE THINKS YOU'VE DONE IT FOR A SILLY JOKE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT YOU'D BEST GO UP THIS EVENING AND TELL HER HOW IT WAS
4214-7146-0066 MY COURAGE FAILS ME AT THE THOUGHT OF FACING DIANA'S INJURED MOTHER SIGHED ANNE I WISH YOU'D GO MARILLA YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE DIGNIFIED THAN I AM LIKELY SHE'D LISTEN TO YOU QUICKER THAN TO ME WELL I WILL
4214-7146-0067 SAID MARILLA REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE WISER COURSE DON'T CRY ANY MORE ANNE IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT MARILLA HAD CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT IT BEING ALL RIGHT BY THE TIME SHE GOT BACK FROM ORCHARD SLOPE ANNE WAS WATCHING FOR HER COMING AND FLEW TO THE PORCH DOOR TO MEET HER
4214-7146-0068 OH MARILLA I KNOW BY YOUR FACE THAT IT'S BEEN NO USE SHE SAID SORROWFULLY MISSUS BARRY WON'T FORGIVE ME MISSUS BARRY INDEED SNAPPED MARILLA OF ALL THE UNREASONABLE WOMEN I EVER SAW SHE'S THE WORST
4214-7146-0069 MARILLA WHISKED INTO THE KITCHEN GRIEVOUSLY DISTURBED LEAVING A VERY MUCH DISTRACTED LITTLE SOUL IN THE PORCH BEHIND HER PRESENTLY ANNE STEPPED OUT BAREHEADED INTO THE CHILL AUTUMN DUSK
4214-7146-0070 VERY DETERMINEDLY AND STEADILY SHE TOOK HER WAY DOWN THROUGH THE SERE CLOVER FIELD OVER THE LOG BRIDGE AND UP THROUGH THE SPRUCE GROVE LIGHTED BY A PALE LITTLE MOON HANGING LOW OVER THE WESTERN WOODS
4214-7146-0071 MISSUS BARRY COMING TO THE DOOR IN ANSWER TO A TIMID KNOCK FOUND A WHITE LIPPED EAGER EYED SUPPLIANT ON THE DOORSTEP HER FACE HARDENED MISSUS BARRY WAS A WOMAN OF STRONG PREJUDICES AND DISLIKES AND HER ANGER WAS OF THE COLD SULLEN SORT WHICH IS ALWAYS HARDEST TO OVERCOME
4214-7146-0072 TO DO HER JUSTICE SHE REALLY BELIEVED ANNE HAD MADE DIANA DRUNK OUT OF SHEER MALICE PREPENSE AND SHE WAS HONESTLY ANXIOUS TO PRESERVE HER LITTLE DAUGHTER FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF FURTHER INTIMACY WITH SUCH A CHILD WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE SAID STIFFLY
4214-7146-0073 ANNE CLASPED HER HANDS OH MISSUS BARRY PLEASE FORGIVE ME I DID NOT MEAN TO TO INTOXICATE DIANA HOW COULD I JUST IMAGINE IF YOU WERE A POOR LITTLE ORPHAN GIRL THAT KIND PEOPLE HAD ADOPTED
4214-7146-0074 AND YOU HAD JUST ONE BOSOM FRIEND IN ALL THE WORLD DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD INTOXICATE HER ON PURPOSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY RASPBERRY CORDIAL I WAS FIRMLY CONVINCED IT WAS RASPBERRY CORDIAL OH PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT YOU WON'T LET DIANA PLAY WITH ME ANY MORE
4214-7146-0075 IF YOU DO YOU WILL COVER MY LIFE WITH A DARK CLOUD OF WOE THIS SPEECH WHICH WOULD HAVE SOFTENED GOOD MISSUS LYNDE'S HEART IN A TWINKLING HAD NO EFFECT ON MISSUS BARRY EXCEPT TO IRRITATE HER STILL MORE SHE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF ANNE'S BIG WORDS AND DRAMATIC GESTURES
4214-7146-0076 AND IMAGINED THAT THE CHILD WAS MAKING FUN OF HER SO SHE SAID COLDLY AND CRUELLY I DON'T THINK YOU ARE A FIT LITTLE GIRL FOR DIANA TO ASSOCIATE WITH YOU'D BETTER GO HOME AND BEHAVE YOURSELF ANNE'S LIPS QUIVERED
4214-7146-0077 WON'T YOU LET ME SEE DIANA JUST ONCE TO SAY FAREWELL SHE IMPLORED DIANA HAS GONE OVER TO CARMODY WITH HER FATHER SAID MISSUS BARRY GOING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR ANNE WENT BACK TO GREEN GABLES CALM WITH DESPAIR
4214-7146-0078 MY LAST HOPE IS GONE SHE TOLD MARILLA I WENT UP AND SAW MISSUS BARRY MYSELF AND SHE TREATED ME VERY INSULTINGLY MARILLA I DO NOT THINK SHE IS A WELL BRED WOMAN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO DO EXCEPT TO PRAY
4214-7146-0079 ANNE YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SUCH THINGS REBUKED MARILLA STRIVING TO OVERCOME THAT UNHOLY TENDENCY TO LAUGHTER WHICH SHE WAS DISMAYED TO FIND GROWING UPON HER AND INDEED WHEN SHE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO MATTHEW THAT NIGHT SHE DID LAUGH HEARTILY OVER ANNE'S TRIBULATIONS
4214-7146-0080 BUT WHEN SHE SLIPPED INTO THE EAST GABLE BEFORE GOING TO BED AND FOUND THAT ANNE HAD CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP AN UNACCUSTOMED SOFTNESS CREPT INTO HER FACE POOR LITTLE SOUL SHE MURMURED
7505-258964-0000 HE MULTIPLIES MANY OTHERS WE HAVE NOTED MANY KINDS OF DEPRECIATION DESTRUCTION AND WEARING OUT OF WEALTH BUT THE NORMAL THING IN A HEALTHY SOCIETY IS AN INCREASE ON THE WHOLE OF RENT BEARERS
7505-258964-0001 THE INCREASE OF RENTS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES CHANGES IN THE AGENTS BY WHICH THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TECHNICALLY OR MORE NUMEROUS AND CHANGES TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENTS
7505-258964-0002 AFFECTING THE UTILITY OF THE PRODUCTS THE FIRST OF THESE WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THIS SECTION THE INCREASE OF THE EFFICIENCY OF AGENTS IS USUALLY THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER
7505-258964-0003 AND THUS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE OF THE STOCK OF WEALTH IN SOME CASES HOWEVER IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF HARBORS OR AS THE PROTECTING OF FORESTS ARE MADE BY MEN COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF GOVERNMENTS
7505-258964-0004 SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
7505-258964-0005 OTHER TRACTS LESS FERTILE OR FOR SOME REASON LESS AVAILABLE ARE DITCHED TILED AND DIKED AND FERTILIZERS ARE CARRIED UP STEEP HILLSIDES TO MAKE A SOIL UPON THE VERY CRAGS
7505-258964-0006 ENABLING THEM TO CARRY A GREATER AMOUNT OF FREIGHT WITHIN A YEAR
7505-258964-0007 THAT MAKE MACHINES STRONGER QUICKER AND BETTER THIS PROPOSITION IS NOT LOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING A MACHINE IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL THINGS
7505-258964-0008 THROUGH WHICH FORCE MAY BE INDIRECTLY APPLIED TO MOVE MATTER NO FAST LINE DIVIDES MACHINERY AS REGARDS FORM PURPOSE OR CAUSE OF VALUE FROM THE ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVED NATURAL AGENTS
7505-258964-0009 THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING JUST AS A FIELD IS DRAINED PLOWED AND CULTIVATED TO FIT IT BETTER TO YIELD A CROP SO IS THE IRON ORE SHAPED INTO A FORM
7505-258964-0010 IF THE QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY OF LOOMS IS DOUBLED IT IS AS IF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN IN LIKE PROPORTION IN ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION THE BEAST OF BURDEN MAY NOT ILLOGICALLY BE CLASSED WITH INANIMATE MACHINES
7505-258964-0011 AND THERE WAS MUCH COMMENT ON THIS EVIDENCE OF A DECLINING INDUSTRY IT WAS NOT AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WAS EMBODIED IN HORSE FLESH MORE HORSE POWER THAN EVER BEFORE
7505-258964-0012 SO AS TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT AND MACHINES IN TURN MAY BE ADJUSTED AS PARTS OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION THE IDEAL OF THE MODERN FACTORY SYSTEM IS SO TO ARRANGE THE MACHINERY
7505-258964-0013 THAT NO BIT OF MATERIAL WILL MAKE AN UNNECESSARY MOTION THE LOG ONCE STARTED THROUGH THE MILL IS CARRIED AUTOMATICALLY FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT EMERGES AS A ROLL OF PAPER
7505-258964-0014 OR AS A BOX OF TOOTH PICKS READY FOR USE IN AN AMERICAN WATCH FACTORY ONE MAN TENDS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN AUTOMATIC MACHINES A SMALL BRASS ROD IS FED AUTOMATICALLY TO THE MACHINE
7505-258964-0015 WHERE IT IS READY FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE WATCH AS THE MACHINERY IMPROVES FACTORIES MAKING ALLIED PRODUCTS ARE GROUPED TO MAKE A SYSTEM STILL MORE EFFICIENT AS THE NUMBER OF AGENTS INCREASES
7505-258964-0016 THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED SO AS TO BE WHERE MOST USEFUL TO THE OWNER A MAN HAVING TWO UMBRELLAS KEEPS ONE AT HIS OFFICE AND THE OTHER AT HOME A STUDENT HAVING TWO BOOKS OF THE SAME KIND
7505-258964-0017 WHICH CAPTURE THE NATURAL FORCES OF THE WORLD PUT THEM INTO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING OR WHICH GROUP AND RELATE THE MATERIALS OF THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAYS
7505-258964-0018 SOME OF THE GROUPINGS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL WORLD THAT DO NOT FIT MAN'S PURPOSES MAY BE MADE TO DO SO
7505-258964-0019 BUT IN DOING THAT HE AFFECTS THE AGENTS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY OTHERS THE IDEAL FROM A SOCIAL STANDPOINT IS TO INCREASE NOT RENT BUT THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY
7505-258964-0020 AND THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE IDEAL OF INDIVIDUALS SEEKING THEIR OWN INTEREST HOWEVER AS THE EFFICIENCY OF SOME AGENTS RISES IT BECOMES UNNECESSARY AND UNPROFITABLE TO USE THE LESS FERTILE FIELDS
7505-258964-0021 THEY CEASE TO BE RENT BEARERS AND THE RENT OF THE RICHER FIELDS FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS SOME INVENTIONS SUDDENLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF FREE GOODS TO SUCH A DEGREE
7505-258964-0022 THAT THE LESS EFFICIENT RENTED AGENTS ARE THROWN OUT OF USE AND THE MARGIN OF UTILIZATION IS MOVED TO A HIGHER PLANE THAN IT WAS ON BEFORE IMPROVED TYPES OF MACHINERY MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY DISPLACE THE OLDER
7505-258964-0023 LESS EFFICIENT TYPES WHICH THEREFORE MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR RENT BEARING POWER LONG BEFORE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY WORN OUT
7505-258964-0024 WHEN IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF LAND TAKE PLACE AND THE PRODUCT THUS IS INCREASED AND CHEAPENED THE POORER LAND IS ABANDONED
7505-258964-0025 AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
7505-258964-0026 SUCH A LUCKY FIND HAS LIFTED THE MORTGAGE FROM A FARM IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA FROM WHICH IN TWO OR THREE YEARS HAS BEEN TAKEN FELDSPAR EXCEEDING IN VALUE THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
7505-258964-0027 OF THE SAME LAND IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE DISCOVERY OF BUILDING STONE COAL NATURAL GAS OR OIL LAND MAY MAKE THE ANNUAL RENT OR ROYALTY
7505-258964-0028 OF LAND TENFOLD ITS FORMER TOTAL VALUE FITNESS TO PRODUCE NETTLES IS NOT ORDINARILY A VIRTUE IN LAND
7505-258964-0029 BUT THE DISCOVERY THAT CERTAIN FIELDS PRODUCE A SUPERIOR QUALITY OF THE NETTLE USED FOR HECKLING CLOTH CAUSES THEM TO TAKE ON A NEW VALUE A MINERAL SPRING BECAUSE OF THE
7505-258964-0030 MAY BE AS GOOD AS A MINE TO THE OWNER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF CELERY MAY CONVERT MARSH LAND INTO A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME
7505-258964-0031 SOCIAL CHANGES ARE CONSTANTLY CAUSING AGENTS TO SHIFT FROM LOWER TO HIGHER USES AS POPULATION GROWS AND GROUPS ABOUT NEW INDUSTRIES FARM LAND IS USED FOR RESIDENCE LOTS
7505-258964-0032 AND IN TURN FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES RENTS THEREFORE RISE AND THIS RISE IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGHER SELLING VALUE OF THE LAND IF A NEW DEMAND ARISES FOR THE PRODUCT OF ANY MACHINE
7505-258964-0033 ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
7505-258964-0034 MAY BE RELATIVELY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOMETIMES CHANGE QUICKLY AN URGENT DEMAND FOR SPECIAL MACHINERY RAISES QUICKLY ITS RENT AND VALUE
7505-258964-0035 IT IS SAID THAT LACE MACHINERY IS SOMETIMES THROWN OUT OF USE FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF THE DEMAND FOR LACE CAUSES THE RENTAL TO EQUAL IN TWO YEARS
7505-258964-0036 MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL COST AT SUCH TIMES THE VALUE OF FACTORIES INCREASES GREATLY BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PROSPERITY BUSINESS AGAIN COLLAPSES
7505-258964-0037 SUCH PROSPEROUS PERIODS ARE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE BUSINESS MAN AND OF THE PROMOTER TO SELL THE FACTORY AT ITS HIGHEST PRICE MACHINERY ADAPTED ONLY FOR A SPECIAL PRODUCT
7505-258964-0038 WILL NOT SELL AS READILY WHEN LESS NEEDED FOR ITS SPECIAL USE AS THAT WHICH LIKE A TURNING LATHE CAN BE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BUT THE MORE SPECIAL THE APPLIANCES NEEDED FOR A CERTAIN PRODUCT THE HIGHER
7505-258964-0039 MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
7505-258964-0040 PUTS A CHECK OR SETS A LIMIT TO THE RISE IN THIS SEARCH FOR NEW DEVICES THE MAN WHO CAN SEE MOST QUICKLY AND CLEARLY HAS A KEY TO WEALTH
7505-258964-0041 SOME KINDS OF AGENTS AS RARE MINERALS OR TOOLS THAT CAN BE PRODUCED ONLY BY HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR CANNOT BE INCREASED RAPIDLY IN NUMBER AND REMAIN HIGH IN PRICE FOR A LONG PERIOD
7505-258964-0042 AND FAVORABLY LOCATED BUILDING SITES ILLUSTRATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN SOME CASES IT IS TRUE THE DEMAND MAY BE DUE TO SOME TEMPORARY CAUSE
7505-258964-0043 WATERWORKS GAS WORKS STREET RAILWAYS FERRIES AND WHARVES THIS EVIDENTLY IS ONLY A SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE JUST STATED WHERE IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN AGENTS
7505-258964-0044 PUBLIC FRANCHISES ENTITLE THE OWNERS TO SPECIAL SOMETIMES EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES AND PROTECT THEM LEGALLY FROM COMPETITION NOT ALL FRANCHISES ARE VALUABLE
7505-258964-0045 MANY STREET RAILWAYS ARE UNFORTUNATE VENTURES THE EARNINGS BEING INSUFFICIENT TO PAY EXPENSES TO SAY NOTHING OF INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY PAY GREATLY
7505-258964-0046 THEIR HIGH VALUE IS DUE TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION THE CARS MULES DYNAMOS STEAM ENGINES
7505-258964-0047 DUE TO ACCIDENTAL AND SOCIAL CAUSES RAISING THE RENTS OF WEALTH THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT MAY BE DEFINED AS AN INCREASE IN RENTS OR VALUE OF AGENTS
7505-258964-0048 DUE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE EFFORTS OR MERITS OF THE OWNER IN FACT IT IS THAT OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IN SOME CASES POWERFUL OR WEALTHY MEN
7505-258964-0049 CAN BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGES IN ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE WAYS THE OWNER OF A LARGE FACTORY MOVING IT INTO THE COUNTRY MAY BUY UP SURROUNDING LAND AND FOUND A CITY CONVERTING PASTURE LANDS AND CORN FIELDS
7505-258964-0050 IS POWERLESS TO AFFECT THE RESULT HE CAN ONLY ADAPT HIS CONDUCT IN SOME MEASURE SO AS TO REAP AN ADVANTAGE HE CAN STRIVE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY
7505-258964-0051 AS WELL AS OF GAIN THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USED IN RECENT YEARS
7505-83618-0000 THEIR CULTURE MYTH WHICH HE HAS RECORDED
7505-83618-0001 THE BLOOD GUSHED FROM HIM AT EVERY STEP AND AS IT FELL TURNED INTO FLINT STONES THE VICTOR RETURNED TO HIS GRANDMOTHER AND ESTABLISHED HIS LODGE IN THE FAR EAST ON THE BORDERS OF THE GREAT OCEAN WHENCE THE SUN COMES IN TIME HE BECAME THE FATHER OF MANKIND
7505-83618-0002 OF THE EARLY NATIVE TRADITIONS SO STRONG IS THE RESEMBLANCE IOSKEHA BEARS TO MICHABO THAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN EXPLANATION OF THE LATTER WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR BOTH
7505-83618-0003 YET I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THE ONE WAS COPIED OR BORROWED FROM THE OTHER WE CANNOT BE TOO CAUTIOUS IN ADOPTING SUCH A CONCLUSION THE TWO NATIONS WERE REMOTE IN EVERYTHING BUT GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION
7505-83618-0004 I CALL TO MIND ANOTHER SIMILAR MYTH IN IT A MOTHER IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TWINS OR A PAIR OF TWINS AND TO HAVE PAID FOR THEM WITH HER LIFE AGAIN THE ONE IS DESCRIBED AS THE BRIGHT
7505-83618-0005 SCHOLARS LIKEWISE HAVE INTERPRETED THE MOTHER TO MEAN THE DAWN THE TWINS EITHER LIGHT AND DARKNESS OR THE FOUR WINDS YET THIS IS NOT ALGONKIN THEOLOGY NOR IS IT AT ALL RELATED TO THAT OF THE IROQUOIS
7505-83618-0006 IT IS THE STORY OF SARAMA IN THE RIG VEDA AND WAS WRITTEN IN SANSCRIT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS CENTURIES BEFORE HOMER SUCH UNIFORMITY POINTS NOT TO A COMMON SOURCE IN HISTORY
7505-83618-0007 BUT IN PSYCHOLOGY MAN CHIEFLY COGNIZANT OF HIS SOUL THROUGH HIS SENSES THOUGHT WITH AN AWFUL HORROR OF THE NIGHT WHICH DEPRIVED HIM OF THE USE OF ONE AND FORESHADOWED THE LOSS OF ALL THEREFORE
7505-83618-0008 LIGHT AND LIFE WERE TO HIM SYNONYMOUS THEREFORE ALL RELIGIONS PROMISE TO LEAD FROM NIGHT TO LIGHT FROM NIGHT TO HEAVENLY LIGHT THEREFORE HE WHO RESCUES IS EVER THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
7505-83618-0009 A MESSIAH FAIRER THAN THE CHILDREN OF MEN FULFILLED IN THAT DAY WHEN HE APPEARED IN GARMENTS SO WHITE AS NO FULLER ON EARTH COULD WHITE THEM
7505-83618-0010 LANGUAGE ITSELF IS PROOF OF IT MANY ALGONKIN WORDS FOR EAST MORNING DAWN DAY LIGHT
7505-83618-0011 ARE DERIVED FROM A RADICAL SIGNIFYING WHITE
7505-83618-0012 BUT PACHACAMA ATTACKED AND DROVE HIM TO THE NORTH IRRITATED AT HIS DEFEAT HE TOOK WITH HIM THE RAIN AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THIS DAY THE SEA COAST OF PERU IS LARGELY AN ARID DESERT NOW WHEN WE ARE INFORMED THAT THE SOUTH WIND
7505-83618-0013 FOR ASKED THE INCAS
7505-83618-0014 FOR HE WAS ATTACKED WITH MURDEROUS INTENT BY THE BEINGS WHOM HE HAD CREATED WHEN HOWEVER SCORNING SUCH UNEQUAL COMBAT HE HAD MANIFESTED HIS POWER BY HURLING THE LIGHTNING ON THE HILL SIDES AND CONSUMING THE FORESTS
7505-83618-0015 THEY RECOGNIZED THEIR MAKER AND HUMBLED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE WAS RECONCILED AND TAUGHT THEM ARTS AND AGRICULTURE INSTITUTIONS AND RELIGION MERITING THE TITLE THEY GAVE HIM OF PACHAYACHACHIC
7505-83618-0016 TEACHER OF ALL THINGS AT LAST HE DISAPPEARED IN THE WESTERN OCEAN FOUR PERSONAGES COMPANIONS OR SONS WERE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIM
7505-83618-0017 TO A THIRD THE EAST TO A FOURTH THE WEST
7505-83618-0018 AND THAT OF MICHABO BOTH PRECEDE AND CREATE THE SUN BOTH JOURNEY TO THE WEST OVERCOMING OPPOSITION WITH THE THUNDERBOLT BOTH DIVIDE THE WORLD BETWEEN THE FOUR WINDS BOTH WERE THE FATHERS GODS AND TEACHERS OF THEIR NATIONS
7505-83618-0019 NOR DOES IT CEASE HERE MICHABO I HAVE SHOWN IS THE WHITE SPIRIT OF THE DAWN VIRACOCHA ALL AUTHORITIES TRANSLATE
7505-83618-0020 FOR HIS HIGH PRIEST ALWAYS BORE HIS NAME BUT HE HIMSELF IS A PURE CREATION OF THE FANCY AND ALL HIS ALLEGED HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT A MYTH HIS EMBLEMATIC NAME THE BIRD SERPENT AND HIS REBUS AND CROSS AT
7505-83618-0021 I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED OTHERS OF HIS TITLES WERE
7505-83618-0022 YOLCUAT THE RATTLESNAKE TOHIL THE RUMBLER HUEMAC THE STRONG HAND
7505-83618-0023 THE SAME DUALISM REAPPEARS IN HIM THAT HAS BEEN NOTED IN HIS ANALOGUES ELSEWHERE HE IS BOTH LORD OF THE EASTERN LIGHT AND THE WINDS AS THE FORMER HE WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN IN THE LAND OF TULA OR TLAPALLAN IN THE DISTANT ORIENT
7505-83618-0024 HE WAS FIGURATIVELY SAID TO SWEEP THE ROAD FOR HIM SINCE IN THAT COUNTRY VIOLENT WINDS ARE THE PRECURSORS OF THE WET SEASONS WHEREVER HE WENT ALL MANNER OF SINGING BIRDS BORE HIM COMPANY EMBLEMS OF THE WHISTLING BREEZES
7505-83618-0025 THE HILL OF SHOUTING WITH SUCH A MIGHTY VOICE THAT IT COULD BE HEARD A HUNDRED LEAGUES AROUND THE ARROWS WHICH HE SHOT TRANSFIXED GREAT TREES THE STONES HE THREW LEVELLED FORESTS
7505-83618-0026 AND WHEN HE LAID HIS HANDS ON THE ROCKS THE MARK WAS INDELIBLE YET AS THUS EMBLEMATIC OF THE THUNDER STORM HE POSSESSED IN FULL MEASURE
587-54108-0000 SAW THE TRIO APPROACHING FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS SUMMER ATTIRE WHEN HE DID SURPRISE THEN PLEASURE THEN A SPIRIT OF INQUIETUDE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM HE HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY STARTLED ON RUTH'S BIRTHNIGHT
587-54108-0001 BY A VAGUE SOMETHING IN KEMP'S EYES THE FEELING HOWEVER HAD VANISHED GRADUALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR ALWAYS HAD A PECULIARLY INTENT GAZE AND MOREOVER NO ONE COULD HAVE HELPED APPRECIATING HER LOVELINESS THAT NIGHT
587-54108-0002 THIS OF ITSELF WILL BRING A SOFTNESS INTO A MAN'S MANNER AND WITHOUT DOUBT HIS FEARS HAD BEEN GROUNDLESS FEARS THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT INTO WORDS FOR OLD MAN AS HE WAS HE REALIZED THAT DOCTOR KEMP'S STRONG PERSONALITY
587-54108-0003 WAS SUCH AS WOULD PROVE DANGEROUSLY SEDUCTIVE TO ANY WOMAN WHOM HE CARED TO HONOR WITH HIS FAVOR BUT WITH A GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN DESIRE HE HAD PUT THE QUESTION FROM HIM HE COULD HAVE TAKEN HIS OATH ON RUTH'S HEART WHOLENESS
587-54108-0004 YET NOW AS HE RECOGNIZED HER COMPANION HIS MISGIVINGS RETURNED THREEFOLD THE COURTEOUS GENTLEMAN HOWEVER WAS AT HIS EASE AS THEY CAME UP THIS IS A SURPRISE DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED CORDIALLY OPENING THE GATE AND EXTENDING HIS HAND
587-54108-0005 KEMP GRASPED HIS HAND HEARTILY I AM A SORT OF SURPRISE PARTY HE ANSWERED SWINGING ETHEL TO THE GROUND AND WATCHING HER SCAMPER OFF TO THE HOTEL AND WHAT IS MORE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM I HAVE NOT BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH MAKES ONE OF ME
587-54108-0006 THIS IS A VERITABLE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY COME UP AND LISTEN TO MY WIFE RHAPSODIZE HOW IS SHE HE ASKED TURNING WITH HIM AND CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF RUTH'S VANISHING FIGURE
587-54108-0007 HE PROTESTED AT SUCH A STUPENDOUS COMPARISON AND INSISTED THAT SHE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DUMMY WAS NOT INCLUDED THE SHORT AFTERNOON GLIDED INTO EVENING AND DOCTOR KEMP WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL AND DINED AT THE LEVICES TABLE
587-54108-0008 RUTH IN A WHITE WOOL GOWN SAT OPPOSITE HIM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DINED WITH THEM AND HE ENJOYED A SINGULAR FEELING OVER THE SITUATION
587-54108-0009 SHE ATE A HEARTY MEAL AND THAT RUTH WHO WAS UNUSUALLY QUIET TASTED SCARCELY ANYTHING HER FATHER ALSO OBSERVED IT AND RESOLVED UPON A COURSE OF STRICT SURVEILLANCE HE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE ON THE EARLY MORNING'S TRAIN
587-54108-0010 THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT SAY SO AS THEY STROLLED ABOUT AFTERWARD HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM AND ALLOWED KEMP TO APPROPRIATE HIS WIFE THEY FINALLY DRIFTED TO THE COTTAGE STEPS
587-54108-0011 AND WERE ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHEN WILL TYRRELL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THEM GOOD EVENING HE SAID TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
587-54108-0012 FATHER SAYS HE HAS AT LAST SCARED UP TWO OTHER GENTLEMEN AND WILL YOU PLEASE COME OVER AND PLAY A RUBBER OF WHIST MISTER LEVICE FELT HIMSELF A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE AND MISTER TYRRELL HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF OPPONENTS AND HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP THE SEARCH
587-54108-0013 NOW WHEN HE DECIDEDLY OBJECTED TO MOVING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTLESS NOT TO GO DON'T CONSIDER ME SAID THE DOCTOR OBSERVING HIS HESITANCY IF IT ILL RELIEVE YOU I ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT MISS YOU IN THE LEAST GO RIGHT AHEAD JULES URGED HIS WIFE
587-54108-0014 RUTH AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR IF SHE HAD PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF RUTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS MIND BUT SINCE HIS WIFE WAS THERE WHAT HARM COULD ACCRUE THAT HIS PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT SO WITH A SINCERE APOLOGY HE WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL
587-54108-0015 HE HARDLY APPRECIATED WHAT AN ADMIRABLE AIDE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM IN HIS WIFE KEMP SAT UPON THE TOP STEP AND LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST THE RAILING
587-54108-0016 WHO SWAYED TO AND FRO IN HER ROCKER HE WAS INTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF RUTH'S WHITE FIGURE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL
587-54108-0017 BUT SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT KEMP WAS ADDRESSING HER I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY PROWESS TO YOU MISS LEVICE IN WHAT SHE ASKED SOMEWHAT DAZED RUTH RUTH LAUGHED HER MOTHER
587-54108-0018 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD OF ALL MY GLOWING COMPLIMENTS ON YOUR ROWING AND I WAS TELLING YOUR MOTHER THAT IN ALL MODESTY I WAS CONSIDERED A FINE OAR AT MY ALMA MATER
587-54108-0019 THAT AS IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT YOUR TAKING A LITTLE ROW AND THEN EACH CAN JUDGE OF THE OTHER'S CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY MY CLAIM HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTLY ESTABLISHED SAID RUTH I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANY ONE TO USURP MY OARS
587-54108-0020 AS YET CORRECTED KEMP THEN WILL YOU WRAP SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND COME DOWN TO THE RIVER CERTAINLY SHE WILL ANSWERED HER MOTHER RUN IN AND GET SOME WRAPS RUTH YOU WILL COME TOO MAMMA OF COURSE BUT CONSIDERING DOCTOR KEMP'S LENGTH
587-54108-0021 A THIRD IN YOUR LITTLE BOAT WILL BE THE PROVERBIAL TRUMPERY STILL I SUPPOSE I CAN RELY ON YOU TWO CRACK OARSMEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE SLIGHTEST TREMBLE IN THE BOAT IN THE FAIREST WEATHER IS LIKELY TO CREATE A SQUALL ON MY PART
587-54108-0022 IF DOCTOR KEMP WISHED TO ROW HE SHOULD ROW AND SINCE THE JEWISH MISSUS GRUNDY WAS NOT ON HAND ANYTHING HARMLESSLY ENJOYABLE WAS PERMISSIBLE RUTH WENT INDOORS THIS WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR
587-54108-0023 HOW COULD HER MOTHER BE SO BLIND AS NOT TO KNOW OR FEEL HER DESIRE TO EVADE DOCTOR KEMP SHE FELT A POSITIVE CONTEMPT FOR HERSELF THAT HIS PRESENCE SHOULD AFFECT HER AS IT DID SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT HIM LEST HER HEART SHOULD FLUTTER TO HER EYES
587-54108-0024 PROBABLY THE DISPLAY AMUSED HIM WHAT WAS SHE TO HIM ANYWAY BUT A GIRL WITH WHOM HE COULD FLIRT IN HIS IDLE MOMENTS WELL WITH A PASSIONATE FLING OF HER ARMS SHE WOULD EXTINGUISH HER UNCONTROLLABLE LITTLE BEATER FOR THE NONCE
587-54108-0025 SHE WOULD MEET AND ANSWER EVERY ONE OF HIS LONG GLANCES IN KIND SHE WOUND A BLACK LACE SHAWL AROUND HER HEAD AND WITH SOME WRAPS FOR HER MOTHER CAME OUT HADN'T YOU BETTER PUT SOMETHING OVER YOUR SHOULDERS HE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY AS SHE APPEARED
587-54108-0026 AND DISGUST THE NIGHT WITH LACK OF APPRECIATION SHE TURNED TO A CORNER OF THE PORCH AND LIFTED A PAIR OF OARS TO HER SHOULDER WHY HE SAID IN SURPRISE COMING TOWARD HER YOU KEEP YOUR OARS AT HOME ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NEITHER A BORROWER NOR A LENDER BE
587-54108-0027 WE FIND IT SAVES BOTH TIME AND SPLEEN SHE HELD THEM LIGHTLY IN PLACE ON HER SHOULDER ALLOW ME HE SAID PLACING HIS HAND UPON THE OARS A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
587-54108-0028 HE GENTLY LIFTED HER RESISTING FINGERS ONE BY ONE AND RAISED THE BROAD BONE OF CONTENTION TO HIS SHOULDER
587-54108-0029 THE CRICKETS CHIRPED IN THE HEDGES NOW AND THEN A FIREFLY FLASHED BEFORE THEM
587-54108-0030 OTHERS ARE ENJOYING THEMSELVES ALSO HE REMARKED AS THEIR FEET TOUCHED THE PEBBLY BEACH A FAINT CRESCENT MOON SHONE OVER THE WATER RUTH WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LITTLE BOAT AGROUND ON THE SHORE IT LOOKS LIKE A COCKLE SHELL HE SAID
587-54108-0031 AS HE PUT ONE FOOT IN AFTER SHOVING IT OFF
587-54108-0032 IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
587-54108-0033 STANDING MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE BOAT YOUR PLACE AH YES NOW HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HER WILL YOU STEP IN SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND STEPPED IN THEY WERE BOTH STANDING AND AS THE LITTLE BARK SWAYED HE MADE A MOVEMENT TO CATCH HOLD OF HER
587-54108-0034 YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN HE SAID MOTIONING TO THE ROWER'S SEAT AND YOU SHE ASKED I SHALL SIT BESIDE YOU AND USE THE OTHER OAR HE ANSWERED NONCHALANTLY SMILING DOWN AT HER WITH A HALF PLEASED FEELING OF DISCOMFITURE
587-54108-0035 THAT IS NO HINDRANCE TO MY VOLUBILITY I AM GLAD TO SAY A BACK IS NOT VERY INSPIRING OR EXPRESSIVE BUT RUTH CAN TELL ME WHEN YOU LOOK BORED IF I WAX TOO DISCURSIVE IT WAS A TINY BOAT
587-54108-0036 AND SEATED THUS KEMP'S KNEES WERE NOT HALF A FOOT FROM RUTH'S WHITE GOWN WILL YOU DIRECT ME HE SAID AS HE SWEPT AROUND I HAVE NOT ROWED ON THIS RIVER FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS YOU CAN KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD FOR SOME DISTANCE SHE SAID LEANING BACK IN HER SEAT
587-54108-0037 SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE EASY MOTION OF HIS FIGURE AS HE ROWED LIGHTLY DOWN THE RIVER HIS FLANNEL SHIRT LOW AT THE THROAT SHOWED HIS STRONG WHITE NECK RISING LIKE A COLUMN FROM HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
587-54108-0038 AND SEEMED STRIVING TO OUTDO THE NIGHT IN BRILLIANCY FOR A WHILE KEMP MAINTAINED A SORT OF ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER CONVERSATION WITH HER BUT WITH HIS EYES CONTINUALLY STRAYING TO THE GIRL BEFORE HIM IT BECAME RATHER DIFFICULT
587-54108-0039 SOME MERRY ROWERS DOWN THE RIVER WERE SINGING COLLEGE SONGS HARMONIOUSLY
587-54108-0040 THE BALMY SUMMER FREIGHTED AIR MADE HER FEEL DROWSY SHE LISTENED ABSENTLY TO RUTH'S OCCASIONAL WARNINGS TO KEMP AND TO THE SWIFT DIP OF THE OARS NOW WE HAVE CLEAR SAILING FOR A STRETCH SAID RUTH AS THEY CAME TO A BROAD CURVE
587-54108-0041 SHE LEANED A LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD LOOKING PAST KEMP MAMMA THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF BACK IN HER SEAT
587-54108-0042 HER HEAD WAS LEANING AGAINST THE FLAG STAFF
587-54108-0043 DOCTOR KEMP MOVED QUIETLY BACK TO HIS FORMER POSITION FAR ACROSS THE RIVER A WOMAN'S SILVERY VOICE WAS SINGING THE SWEET OLD LOVE SONG JUANITA OVERHEAD THE GOLDEN CRESCENT MOON HUNG LOW FROM THE FLOOR OF HEAVEN PULSATING WITH STARS
587-54108-0044 SHE SCARCELY SEEMED TO BREATHE SO STILL SHE SAT HER SLENDER HANDS LOOSELY CLASPED IN HER LAP DOCTOR KEMP SAT OPPOSITE HER AND MISSUS LEVICE SLEPT SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY SPED THE TINY BOAT
587-54108-0045 LONG GENTLE STROKES TOUCHED THE WATER AND PRESENTLY THE OARS LAY IDLE IN THEIR LOCKS THEY WERE UNCONSCIOUSLY DRIFTING THE WATER DIPPED AND LAPPED ABOUT THE SIDES THE TENDER WOMAN'S VOICE ACROSS THE WATER STOLE TO THEM
587-54108-0046 SINGING OF LOVE THEIR EYES MET
587-54108-0047 EVER IN THE AFTER TIME WHEN RUTH HEARD THAT SONG SHE WAS AGAIN ROCKING IN THE FRAIL ROW BOAT UPON THE LOVELY RIVER AND A MAN'S DEEP GRAVE EYES HELD HERS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER LET THEM GO
587-54108-0048 TILL UNDER HIS WORSHIPPING EYES HER OWN FILLED WITH SLOW ECSTATIC TEARS DOCTOR CALLED A STARTLED VOICE ROW OUT I AM RIGHT UNDER THE TREES THEY BOTH STARTED
587-54108-0049 THEY HAD DRIFTED INTO A COVE AND SHE WAS COWERING FROM THE OVER HANGING BOUGHS I DO NOT CARE TO BE ABSALOMED WHERE WERE YOUR EYES RUTH SHE COMPLAINED AS KEMP PUSHED OUT WITH A HAPPY APOLOGETIC LAUGH
587-54108-0050 NO SHE ANSWERED A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY I BELIEVE I AM GROWING FAR SIGHTED IT MUST BE TIME TO SIGHT HOME NOW SAID HER MOTHER I AM QUITE CHILLY
587-54108-0051 WHEN HE TURNED FOR RUTH SHE HAD ALREADY SPRUNG ASHORE AND HAD STARTED UP THE SLOPE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OARS LAY FORGOTTEN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT
587-54108-0052 AND THE SLIGHT WHITE FIGURE STOOD STILL TILL THEY CAME UP YOU ARE SO SLOW SHE SAID WITH A RECKLESS LITTLE LAUGH I FEEL AS IF I COULD FLY HOME ARE YOU LIGHT HEADED RUTH ASKED HER MOTHER BUT THE GIRL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THEM
587-54108-0053 SHE COULD NOT YET MEET HIS EYES AGAIN COME RUTH EITHER STAY WITH US OR JUST AHEAD OF US
587-54108-0054 THERE IS NOTHING ABROAD HERE BUT THE STARS SHE ANSWERED FLITTING BEFORE THEM AND THEY ARE STANCH SILENT FRIENDS ON SUCH A NIGHT REMARKED KEMP SOFTLY
587-54108-0055 AND STOOD INSIDE OF IT AS THEY DREW NEAR THEN YOU WILL NOT BE HOME TILL MONDAY HE SAID TAKING MISSUS LEVICE'S HAND AND RAISING HIS HAT AND I AM OFF ON THE EARLY MORNING TRAIN GOOD BY AS SHE TURNED IN AT THE GATE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO RUTH
587-54108-0056 HIS FINGERS CLOSED SOFTLY TIGHTLY OVER HERS SHE HEARD HIM SAY ALMOST INAUDIBLY TILL MONDAY SHE RAISED HER SHY EYES FOR ONE BRIEF SECOND TO HIS GLOWING ONES AND HE PASSED A TALL DARK FIGURE DOWN THE SHADOWY ROAD
587-54108-0057 SLEEP WITH THIS NEW CROWN UPON HER HUMBLE AS THE BEAUTIFUL BEGGAR MAID MUST HAVE FELT WHEN THE KING RAISED HER SHE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD BEEN THUS CHOSEN BY ONE WHOM SHE HAD DEEMED SO IMMEASURABLY ABOVE HER
587-41619-0000 WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
587-41619-0001 NORA WAS THE SECOND PHI SIGMA TAU TO UNDERGO THE ORDEAL AS SHE BRISKLY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINES THE ACTOR STOPPED HER TAKING THE BOOK FROM HER HE TURNED TO THE PART WHERE TOUCHSTONE QUAINTLY HUMOROUS HOLDS FORTH UPON THE LIE SEVEN TIMES REMOVED
587-41619-0002 READ THIS HE SAID BRIEFLY HOLDING OUT THE BOOK TO NORA NORA BEGAN AND READ GLIBLY ON UNCONSCIOUSLY EMPHASIZING AS SHE DID SO DOWN ONE PAGE SHE READ AND HALF WAY THROUGH THE NEXT BEFORE MISTER SOUTHARD SEEMED SATISFIED
587-41619-0003 THEN HE AGAIN HELD CONVERSATION WITH MISS TEBBS WHO NODDED AND LOOKED SMILINGLY TOWARD NORA WHO STOOD SCOWLING FAINTLY RATHER ILL PLEASED AT ATTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION
587-41619-0004 WHISPERED JESSICA TO GRACE WHO WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN MISTER SOUTHARD MOTIONED TO HER GRACE WHO KNEW THE SCENE BY HEART WENT FEARLESSLY FORWARD AND READ THE LINES WITH SPLENDID EMPHASIS MARIAN AND EVA ALLEN FOLLOWED HER
587-41619-0005 AND ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT THEN ELEANOR'S TURN CAME HANDING HER COAT WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN OFF AND CARRIED UPON HER ARM TO EDNA WRIGHT SHE WALKED PROUDLY OVER THEN WITHOUT A TRACE OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
587-41619-0006 BEGAN THE READING OF THE DESIGNATED LINES HER VOICE SOUNDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND SWEET YET LACKED SOMETHING OF THE POWER OF EXPRESSION DISPLAYED BY GRACE IN HER RENDERING OF THE SAME SCENE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
587-41619-0007 SHE HANDED THE BOOK BACK WITH AN AIR OF STUDIED INDIFFERENCE SHE WAS FAR FROM FEELING SHE HAD DECIDED IN HER OWN MIND THAT ROSALIND WAS THE PART BEST SUITED TO HER AND FELT THAT THE HONOR NOW LAY BETWEEN HERSELF AND GRACE
587-41619-0008 NO OTHER GIRLS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NORA HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO READ AS MUCH OF ANY SCENE AS THEY TWO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO READ BUT ELEANOR HAD RECKONED WITHOUT HER HOST FOR THERE WAS ONE GIRL WHO HAD NOT AS YET COME TO THE FRONT
587-41619-0009 THE GIRL WAS ANNE PIERSON WHO IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER HAD BEEN ALL BUT OVERLOOKED UNTIL MISS TEBBS SPIED HER STANDING BETWEEN GRACE AND NORA CAN YOU SPARE US A MOMENT MORE MISTER SOUTHARD SAID MISS TEBBS TO THE ACTOR WHO WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE
587-41619-0010 JUST AS THAT TEACHER HAD OBSERVED HER AS MOST OF THE GIRLS PRESENT HAD HEARD ANNE RECITE
587-41619-0011 THEY EXPECTED HER TO LIVE UP TO HER REPUTATION AND SHE HAD SCARCELY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINE BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT SHE WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT THEM HER MUSICAL VOICE VIBRATED WITH EXPRESSION
587-41619-0012 AND THE MOCK SERIOUS BANTERING TONES IN WHICH SHE DELIVERED ROSALIND'S WITTY SPEECHES CAUSED MISTER SOUTHARD TO SMILE AND NOD APPROVINGLY AS SHE GAVE FULL VALUE TO THE IMMORTAL LINES HER CHANGE OF VOICE FROM ROSALIND TO ORLANDO WAS WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL
587-41619-0013 AND SO CHARMINGLY DID SHE DEPICT BOTH CHARACTERS THAT WHEN SHE ENDED WITH ORLANDO'S EXIT SHE RECEIVED A LITTLE OVATION FROM THE LISTENING GIRLS IN WHICH MISTER SOUTHARD AND MISS TEBBS JOINED
587-41619-0014 I WANTED HER TO PLAY ROSALIND AND I KNEW SHE COULD DO IT LOOK GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD IS SHAKING HANDS WITH HER TRUE ENOUGH ANNE WAS SHYLY SHAKING HANDS WITH THE GREAT ACTOR WHO WAS CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY UPON HER RECENT EFFORT
587-41619-0015 I AM SURE ROSALIND WILL BE SAFE WITH YOU
587-41619-0016 IF I AM ANYWHERE NEAR HERE WHEN YOUR PLAY IS ENACTED I SHALL MAKE IT A POINT TO COME AND SEE IT SHAKING HANDS WARMLY WITH MISS TEBBS AND BOWING TO THE ADMIRING GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD HURRIEDLY DEPARTED LEAVING HIS AUDIENCE DEVOURED WITH CURIOSITY AS TO THE CHOSEN ONES
587-41619-0017 ANNE STOOD PERFECTLY STILL LOOKING RATHER DAZED THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED SHE WAS TO HAVE NOT ONLY A PART BUT THE BEST PART AT THAT THE GIRLS GATHERED EAGERLY ABOUT HER CONGRATULATING HER ON HER SUCCESS
587-41619-0018 BUT SHE WAS TOO OVERCOME TO THANK THEM AND SMILED AT THEM THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS LOOK AT ELEANOR WHISPERED NORA TO GRACE SHE'S SO ANGRY SHE CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT SHE MUST HAVE WANTED TO PLAY ROSALIND HERSELF
587-41619-0019 I TOLD YOU SHE'D SULK IF SHE COULDN'T BE THE LEADING LADY GRACE GLANCED OVER TOWARD ELEANOR WHO STOOD BITING HER LIP HER HANDS CLENCHED AND HER FACE SET IN ANGRY LINES SHE LOOKS LIKE THE VENDETTA OR THE CAMORRA
587-41619-0020 OR SOME OTHER ITALIAN VENGEANCE AGENCY DOESN'T SHE SAID NORA WITH A GIGGLE GRACE LAUGHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF AT NORA'S REMARK BUT REGRETTED IT THE NEXT MOMENT FOR ELEANOR SAW THE GLANCES DIRECTED TOWARD HER AND HEARD NORA'S GIGGLE
587-41619-0021 THEN STOPPED AND TURNING HER BACK UPON THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEGAN TALKING TO EDNA WRIGHT JUST THEN MISS TEBBS WHO HAD BEEN BUSY WITH HER LIST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD NOW NAME THE CAST AND ALL CONVERSATION CEASED AS BY MAGIC
587-41619-0022 MIRIAM NESBIT WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE DUKE WHILE MARIAN BARBER WAS TO PLAY FREDERICK HIS BROTHER JESSICA WAS IN RAPTURES OVER PHEBE WHILE NORA HAD CAPTURED TOUCHSTONE EVA ALLEN AUDREY AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT
587-41619-0023 YOU WILL REPORT FOR REHEARSAL NEXT TUESDAY AFTERNOON AFTER SCHOOL WHEN TYPEWRITTEN COPIES OF YOUR PARTS WILL BE HANDED YOU SAID MISS TEBBS AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM THE MOMENT MISS TEBBS CEASED TALKING THE GIRLS BEGAN AS THEY GATHERED IN LITTLE GROUPS AROUND THE LUCKY ONES
587-41619-0024 THERE GOES ELEANOR AFTER MISS TEBBS OBSERVED MARIAN BARBER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'S UP TO NOW OH NEVER MIND HER SAID NORA IMPATIENTLY YOU'LL SEE ENOUGH OF HER DURING REHEARSAL IT WILL BE SO PLEASANT TO REHEARSE WITH HER
587-41619-0025 CONSIDERING THAT SHE ISN'T ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH ANY OF US HAD THE GIRL CHUMS KNOWN THEN WHAT ELEANOR WAS UP TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO ALL OF THEM AFTER IMPERIOUSLY COMMANDING HER SATELLITES TO WAIT FOR HER IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41619-0026 ELEANOR OVERTOOK MISS TEBBS JUST OUTSIDE MISS THOMPSON'S OFFICE I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU MISS TEBBS SAID ELEANOR AS THE TEACHER PAUSED HER HAND ON THE DOORKNOB WELL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU MISS SAVELL I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT THE PLAY
587-41619-0027 AND YOU CAN WIN PLENTY OF APPLAUSE PLAYING IT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT ONCE HAVING GIVEN OUT A PART I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM THE GIRL I HAD GIVEN IT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OTHER GIRL DESIRED IT THAT WOULD BE BOTH UNFAIR AND UNJUST
587-41619-0028 STOOD AWAITING HER REPLY I SHOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ELEANOR SAID SLOWLY A CURIOUS LIGHT IN HER EYES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TEBBS
4640-19189-0000 THE PLENITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION HE WAS INCOMPLETE HOWEVER SO FAR AS THE ABSOLUTE CAN BE SO HE HAD TOO MUCH OF SAINT JUST ABOUT HIM AND NOT ENOUGH OF ANACHARSIS CLOOTS
4640-19189-0001 STILL HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA
4640-19189-0002 AND HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
4640-19189-0003 A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS
4640-19189-0004 THEY WERE LIKE THE MANE OF A STARTLED LION IN THE FLAMING OF AN HALO
4640-19189-0005 OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST
4640-19189-0006 HUMAN CONSCIENCE BECOME AN ALTAR NO MORE HATREDS THE FRATERNITY OF THE WORKSHOP AND THE SCHOOL FOR SOLE PENALTY AND RECOMPENSE FAME WORK FOR ALL RIGHT FOR ALL
4640-19189-0007 PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
4640-19189-0008 AND THE TALONS OF A TIGER FEARFUL BEASTS WHICH WERE ABOVE MAN MAN NEVERTHELESS SPREAD HIS SNARES CONSECRATED BY INTELLIGENCE AND FINALLY CONQUERED THESE MONSTERS
4640-19189-0009 ON THE DAY WHEN THIS PROMETHEAN TASK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN MAN SHALL HAVE DEFINITELY HARNESSED TO HIS WILL THE TRIPLE CHIMAERA OF ANTIQUITY THE HYDRA THE DRAGON AND THE GRIFFIN
4640-19189-0010 COURAGE AND ONWARD CITIZENS WHITHER ARE WE GOING TO SCIENCE MADE GOVERNMENT TO THE FORCE OF THINGS BECOME THE SOLE PUBLIC FORCE
4640-19189-0011 WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN NO MORE FICTIONS NO MORE PARASITES THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE
4640-19189-0012 EUROPE WILL HAVE HER AMPHICTYONS THE GLOBE WILL HAVE ITS AMPHICTYONS FRANCE BEARS THIS SUBLIME FUTURE IN HER BREAST THIS IS THE GESTATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
4640-19189-0013 I REVERE YOU YES YOU CLEARLY BEHOLD THE FUTURE YES YOU ARE RIGHT YOU HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER
4640-19189-0014 YOU ADOPTED HUMANITY FOR YOUR MOTHER AND RIGHT FOR YOUR FATHER YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE THAT IS TO SAY TO TRIUMPH HERE CITIZENS WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DAY THROUGH OUR DEFEAT AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR VICTORY
4640-19189-0015 WHERE TWO OR THREE OF THESE SOVEREIGNTIES ARE COMBINED THE STATE BEGINS BUT IN THAT ASSOCIATION THERE IS NO ABDICATION EACH SOVEREIGNTY CONCEDES A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE COMMON RIGHT
4640-19189-0016 THIS QUANTITY IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US THIS IDENTITY OF CONCESSION WHICH EACH MAKES TO ALL IS CALLED EQUALITY COMMON RIGHT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PROTECTION OF ALL BEAMING ON THE RIGHT OF EACH
4640-19189-0017 THIS PROTECTION OF ALL OVER EACH IS CALLED FRATERNITY THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF ALL THESE ASSEMBLED SOVEREIGNTIES IS CALLED SOCIETY THIS INTERSECTION BEING A JUNCTION THIS POINT IS A KNOT
4640-19189-0018 HENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME THING THE WORD CONTRACT
4640-19189-0019 A SOCIETY OF GREAT BLADES OF GRASS AND TINY OAKS A PROXIMITY OF JEALOUSIES WHICH RENDER EACH OTHER NULL AND VOID LEGALLY SPEAKING IT IS ALL APTITUDES POSSESSED OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
4640-19189-0020 POLITICALLY IT IS ALL VOTES POSSESSED OF THE SAME WEIGHT RELIGIOUSLY IT IS ALL CONSCIENCES POSSESSED OF THE SAME RIGHT EQUALITY HAS AN ORGAN GRATUITOUS AND OBLIGATORY INSTRUCTION
4640-19189-0021 AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING YES INSTRUCTION LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0022 THEN THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF OLD WE SHALL NO LONGER AS TO DAY HAVE TO FEAR A CONQUEST AN INVASION A USURPATION A RIVALRY OF NATIONS
4640-19189-0023 ARMS IN HAND AN INTERRUPTION OF CIVILIZATION DEPENDING ON A MARRIAGE OF KINGS ON A BIRTH IN HEREDITARY TYRANNIES A PARTITION OF PEOPLES BY A CONGRESS A DISMEMBERMENT BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF A DYNASTY
4640-19189-0024 FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS WE SHALL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0025 AS THE PLANET AROUND THE LIGHT FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
4640-19189-0026 OH THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DELIVERED RAISED UP CONSOLED WE AFFIRM IT ON THIS BARRIER WHENCE SHOULD PROCEED THAT CRY OF LOVE IF NOT FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SACRIFICE
4640-19189-0027 A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES HERE MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME
4640-19189-0028 FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
4640-19189-0029 AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED WITH THE DAWN
4640-19189-0030 HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
4640-19189-0031 JAVERT LACONIC
4640-19189-0032 LET THE READER RECALL THE STATE OF HIS SOUL WE HAVE JUST RECALLED IT EVERYTHING WAS A VISION TO HIM NOW HIS JUDGMENT WAS DISTURBED
4640-19189-0033 MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4640-19189-0034 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
4640-19189-0035 WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
4640-19189-0036 AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
4640-19189-0037 AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
4640-19189-0038 BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN HIM
4640-19189-0039 THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE
4640-19189-0040 ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
4640-19189-0041 HE ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
4640-19189-0042 JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4640-19189-0043 THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
4640-19189-0044 FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
4640-19188-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
4640-19188-0001 STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
4640-19188-0002 HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
4640-19188-0003 YOU WOULD FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS
4640-19188-0004 ENTERED THE TAP ROOM THEY EMERGED THENCE A MOMENT LATER
4640-19188-0005 COME SAID HE YOU MUST HAVE A LITTLE PITY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN SEE HERE ARE THERE WOMEN OR ARE THERE NOT ARE THERE CHILDREN OR ARE THERE NOT

4640-19188-0007 DIE IF YOU WILL BUT DON'T MAKE OTHERS DIE SUICIDES LIKE THAT WHICH IS ON THE BRINK OF ACCOMPLISHMENT HERE ARE SUBLIME BUT SUICIDE IS NARROW AND DOES NOT ADMIT OF EXTENSION
4640-19188-0008 AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
4640-19188-0009 ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
4640-19188-0010 LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF
4640-19188-0011 THAT IS DESERTING ONE'S FAMILY AND THOSE WHO HAVE DAUGHTERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF YOU GET YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE DEAD THAT IS WELL AND TOMORROW YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT BREAD THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
4640-19188-0012 WHO SING AND PRATTLE WHO ARE LIKE A LIVING PERFUME WHO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS IN HEAVEN BY THE PURITY OF VIRGINS ON EARTH
4640-19188-0013 THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU
4640-19188-0014 THINK OF THE SHOPS PAST WHICH WOMEN GO AND COME WITH NECKS ALL BARE AND THROUGH THE MIRE THESE WOMEN TOO WERE PURE ONCE THINK OF YOUR SISTERS THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THEM
4640-19188-0015 YOU ARE NO LONGER ON HAND THAT IS WELL YOU HAVE WISHED TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE FROM ROYALTY AND YOU DELIVER OVER YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THE POLICE FRIENDS HAVE A CARE HAVE MERCY
4640-19188-0016 WE PREVENT THEIR OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS WILL YOU PREVENT THEM FROM GOING TO THE DEAD HOUSE THIS EVENING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR BODIES LET US SEE THOSE WHO HAVE FAMILIES MUST BE TRACTABLE
4640-19188-0017 AND SHAKE HANDS WITH US AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AND LEAVE US HERE ALONE TO ATTEND TO THIS AFFAIR I KNOW WELL THAT COURAGE IS REQUIRED TO LEAVE THAT IT IS HARD BUT THE HARDER IT IS THE MORE MERITORIOUS
4640-19188-0018 YOU SAY I HAVE A GUN I AM AT THE BARRICADE SO MUCH THE WORSE I SHALL REMAIN THERE SO MUCH THE WORSE IS EASILY SAID MY FRIENDS THERE IS A MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE HERE TO MORROW
4640-19188-0019 BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
4640-19188-0020 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
4640-19188-0021 AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
4640-19188-0022 HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
4640-19188-0023 THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
4640-19188-0024 STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
4640-19188-0025 BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
4640-19188-0026 STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
4640-19188-0027 HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
4640-19188-0028 AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
4640-19188-0029 HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
4640-19188-0030 HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
4640-19188-0031 IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
4640-19188-0032 THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
4640-19188-0033 AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
4640-19188-0034 AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU
4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0037 AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOUR
4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0039 THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
4640-19188-0040 AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
8324-286683-0000 ONE WARM DAY IN WINTER WHEN SOME OF THE PUSSY WILLOWS MADE A MISTAKE AND BEGAN TO GROW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SPRING HAD COME A PARTY OF MUSKRATS WERE VISITING IN THE MARSH BESIDE THE POND ALL AROUND THEM WERE THEIR WINTER HOUSES BUILT OF MUD AND COARSE GRASSES
8324-286683-0001 THESE HOMES LOOKED LIKE HEAPS OF DRIED RUSHES UNLESS ONE WENT CLOSE TO THEM IF ONE DID THAT HE COULD PLAINLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE AND IF ONE HAPPENED TO BE A MUSKRAT AND COULD DIVE AND GO INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WATERY DOORWAYS
8324-286683-0002 AND ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT WE WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WARM WEATHER SAID THE YOUNG MUSKRATS WHAT'S THE USE OF WINTER HARD TO TELL ANSWERED ONE MUSKRAT
8324-286683-0003 WHO HAD LIVED IN THE MARSH LONGER THAN THE REST HARD TO TELL I KNOW IT ALWAYS GIVES ME A GOOD APPETITE THOUGH THEN ALL THE MUSKRATS LAUGHED THEY WERE A JOLLY GOOD NATURED COMPANY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
8324-286683-0004 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
8324-286683-0005 MUD HENS CANNOT BEAR MINKS THEY SAY THAT WHEN A MUD CHICKEN IS MISSING FROM THE NEST
8324-286683-0006 IN SPRING AND SUMMER WHEN THEY CAN FIND FRESH GRASSES AND YOUNG RUSHES OR A FEW PARSNIPS CARROTS AND TURNIPS FROM THE FARMERS FIELDS OTHER ANIMALS ARE QUITE SAFE IN THE WINTER THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON ROOTS
8324-286683-0007 YES GREAT PITY CHUCKLED THE OLD MUSKRAT HOW GLAD YOU WOULD BE TO SEE THEM HE SMILED ALL AROUND HIS LITTLE MOUTH AND SHOWED HIS GNAWING TEETH
8324-286683-0008 HE KNEW THAT THE FROGS WERE BETTER OFF ASLEEP IN THE MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND THAN THEY WOULD BE SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE WITH A FEW HUNGRY GULLS ABOVE THEM THE TURTLES WERE SLEEPING ALL WINTER TOO
8324-286683-0009 THE EELS WERE LYING AT THE BOTTOM STUPID AND DROWSY AND SOMEWHERE THE WATER ADDERS WERE HIDDEN AWAY DREAMING OF SPRING OF ALL THE BIRDS WHO LIVED BY THE WATER ONLY THE GULLS WERE THERE AND THEY WERE NOT POPULAR
8324-286683-0010 IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HELPED KEEP THE POND SWEET AND CLEAN AND PICKED UP AND CARRIED AWAY MANY THINGS WHICH MADE THE SHORE UNTIDY STILL THEY WERE RUDE AND TALKED TOO LOUDLY AND WORE THEIR FEATHERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE FINE LARGE BIRDS
8324-286683-0011 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS JUST LIKE THEM ALWAYS PRETENDING TO BE MORE THAN THEY REALLY WERE FIFTEEN YOUNG MUSKRATS ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL BORN THE SUMMER BEFORE STARTED OFF TO LOOK AT THE OLD HOME
8324-286683-0012 WHERE THEY WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER THAT IS TO SAY
8324-286683-0013 AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
8324-286683-0014 AND TO HEAR THEM SLAP THEIR LONG SCALY TAILS ON THE WATER WHEN THEY DOVE THEY HAD SHORT DOWNY FUR ALMOST BLACK ON THE BACK SOFT GRAY UNDERNEATH AND A REDDISH BROWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
8324-286683-0015 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
8324-286683-0016 SO IT IS NOT STRANGE IF THEY SOMETIMES BEHAVED BADLY IN SOME OTHER FAMILIES WHERE THERE WERE ONLY NINE OR TEN BABIES ALL THE SEASON THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP MORE STRICTLY
8324-286683-0017 LIKE ALL YOUNG MUSKRATS THEY WERE FULL OF FUN AND THERE WERE FEW PLEASANTER SIGHTS THAN TO SEE THEM FROLICKING ON A WARM MOONLIGHT EVENING WHEN THEY LOOKED LIKE BROWN BALLS ROLLING AND BOUNDING AROUND ON THE SHORE OR PLUNGING INTO THE WATER
8324-286683-0018 IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
8324-286683-0019 BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
8324-286683-0020 WHEN THEY WERE COLD AND HUNGRY THEY SLAPPED THEIR TAILS ON THE GROUND OR ON THE WATER AND SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART
8324-286683-0021 SHE WOULD SAY NOW CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAD TO STOP
8324-286683-0022 TEASING IS NOT SO VERY BAD YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS DREADFULLY SILLY BUT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN BY TEASING THEY SOMETIMES GET TO SAYING THINGS IN EARNEST EVEN REALLY HATEFUL MEAN THINGS
8324-286683-0023 AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE THE MUSKRAT FATHER AND MOTHER STOP IT WHENEVER THEY COULD NOW THE WHOLE FIFTEEN CROWDED AROUND THE OLD SUMMER HOME AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ONE WAY AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ANOTHER
8324-286683-0024 FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
8324-286683-0025 SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
8324-286683-0026 THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
8324-286683-0027 WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8324-286683-0028 TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
8324-286683-0029 YOU SLAPPED YOUR TAIL ON MY BACK
8324-286683-0030 OR THE HALF WAY BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD GO FIRST INTO THE OLD NEST AND IT DIDN'T MATTER A BIT WHO WAS OLDEST OR WHO WAS YOUNGEST AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR DREADFUL HABIT OF TEASING
8324-286683-0031 BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
8324-286683-0032 SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE PLACE AT ONCE AND NOT ONE OF THEM SHOULD EVEN SET FOOT IN THE OLD NEST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN HURT SHE SAID THIS MADE THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOK VERY SOBER
8324-286683-0033 FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
8324-286683-0034 THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
8324-286683-0035 BUT I SHALL CHOOSE THE GAMES THE OLDEST FIVE WILL PLAY MUD TURTLES IN WINTER THE NEXT FIVE WILL PLAY FROGS IN WINTER AND THE YOUNGEST FIVE WILL PLAY SNAKES IN WINTER
8324-286683-0036 THE WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO LIE PERFECTLY STILL IN SOME DARK PLACE AND NOT SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SORROWFULLY
8324-286683-0037 THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
8324-286683-0038 SO THEY WENT AWAY QUIETLY TO PLAY WHAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM THEY MUST BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH FUN TO PLAY THOSE GAMES WHEN ALL THE OTHERS WERE HAVING A FINE TIME IN THE SUNSHINE
8324-286682-0000 THE LUCKY MINK DURING THE WARM WEATHER THE MINKS DID NOT COME OFTEN TO THE POND THEN THEY HAD TO STAY NEARER HOME AND CARE FOR THEIR BABIES IN THE WINTER WHEN FOOD WAS NOT SO PLENTIFUL
8324-286682-0001 AND THEIR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH TO COME WITH THEM THEY VISITED THERE EVERY DAY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THEIR HOME THE MINKS LIVED BY A WATERFALL IN THE RIVER AND HAD BURROWS IN THE BANKS
8324-286682-0002 WHERE THE YOUNG MINKS STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD THEN THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS WERE VERY BUSY FOR IN EACH HOME THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN HUNGRY AND RESTLESS AND NEEDING TO BE TAUGHT MANY THINGS
8324-286682-0003 THEY WERE RELATED TO THE WEASELS WHO LIVED UP BY THE FARMYARD AND HAD THE SAME SLENDER AND ELEGANT BODIES AND SHORT LEGS AS THEY LIKE THE WEASELS THEY SOMETIMES CLIMBED TREES
8324-286682-0004 THEY DID MOST OF THEIR HUNTING IN THE RIVER SWIMMING WITH THEIR BODIES ALMOST ALL UNDER WATER AND DIVING AND TURNING AND TWISTING GRACEFULLY AND QUICKLY WHEN THEY HUNTED ON LAND THEY COULD TELL BY SMELLING JUST WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THEIR FOOD
8324-286682-0005 THE MINKS WERE A VERY DARK BROWN AND SCATTERED THROUGH THEIR CLOSE SOFT FUR WERE LONG SHINING HAIRS OF AN EVEN DARKER SHADE WHICH MADE THEIR COATS VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED THE FUR WAS DARKER ON THEIR BACKS THAN ON THE UNDER PART OF THEIR BODIES
8324-286682-0006 AND THEIR TAPERING BUSHY TAILS WERE ALMOST BLACK THEIR UNDER JAWS WERE WHITE AND THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF THEM PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD SO LITTLE WHITE FUR THAT THEY THOUGHT SO MUCH OF IT YOU KNOW THAT IS OFTEN THE WAY
8324-286682-0007 WE THINK MOST OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE SCARCE OR HARD TO GET THERE WAS ONE OLD MINK BY THE RIVER WHO HAD A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IS EVEN MORE UNCOMMON
8324-286682-0008 THAN FOR MINKS TO HAVE WHITE UPPER LIPS AND THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THIS MINK WAS A BACHELOR AND NOBODY KNEW WHY SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS WAITING TO FIND A WIFE WITH A WHITE TIP ON HER TAIL
8324-286682-0009 YET THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR HE WAS TOO WISE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN HOWEVER IT WAS HE LIVED ALONE AND FISHED AND HUNTED JUST FOR HIMSELF HE COULD DIVE MORE QUICKLY
8324-286682-0010 STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
8324-286682-0011 WHEN THE MINKS VISITED TOGETHER SOMEBODY WAS SURE TO SPEAK OF THE BACHELOR'S LUCK THEY SAID THAT WHATEVER HE DID HE WAS ALWAYS LUCKY IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL THEY SAID
8324-286682-0012 THAT MAKES HIM LUCKY THE YOUNG MINKS HEARD THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS TALKING AND WISHED THAT THEY HAD BEEN BORN WITH WHITE TIPS ON THEIR TAILS SO THAT THEY COULD BE LUCKY TOO ONCE THE BACHELOR HEARD THEM WISHING THIS AND HE SMILED AND SHOWED HIS BEAUTIFUL TEETH
8324-286682-0013 AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
8324-286682-0014 AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0015 HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A FINE MINK AS THE BACHELOR AND HE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND
8324-286682-0016 HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
8324-286682-0017 BIG BROTHER STOOD IT VERY PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE THEN HE SNARLED AT THEM AND SHOWED HIS TEETH WITHOUT SMILING AND SAID HE WOULD FIGHT ANYBODY WHO SPOKE ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT MINKS ARE VERY BRAVE AND VERY FIERCE
8324-286682-0018 AND NEVER KNOW WHEN TO STOP IF THEY HAVE BEGUN TO FIGHT SO AFTER THAT NOBODY DARED TEASE BIG BROTHER BY SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE BACHELOR SOMETIMES THEY DID LOOK AT HIS TAIL AND SMILE BUT THEY NEVER SPOKE
8324-286682-0019 AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE BACHELOR WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP A COMMON CLUMSY WOODEN TRAP PUT TOGETHER WITH NAILS AND TWINE
8324-286682-0020 IT WAS NOT NEAR THE RIVER AND NONE OF HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF BIG BROTHER HAD NOT HAPPENED ALONG HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A TRAP HAD DARED TO CATCH A MINK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286682-0021 THEN HE HEARD THE BACHELOR GROAN AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO HE HURRIED UP TO WHERE THE TRAP WAS CAN'T YOU GET OUT SAID HE NO SAID THE BACHELOR I CAN'T THE BEST WAY TO GET
8324-286682-0022 OUT IS NOT TO GET IN AND I'VE GOTTEN IN CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LUCKY TAIL TO MAKE THE TRAP OPEN ASKED BIG BROTHER I COULD DO SOMETHING WITH MY TEETH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR IF THEY WERE ONLY WHERE THE TIP OF MY TAIL IS
8324-286682-0023 WHY ARE MINKS ALWAYS WALKING INTO TRAPS HE WAS TRYING HARD NOT TO BE CROSS BUT HIS EYES SHOWED HOW HE FELT AND THAT WAS VERY CROSS INDEED THEN BIG BROTHER BECAME MUCH EXCITED
8324-286682-0024 I HAVE GOOD TEETH SAID HE TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL HELP ME OUT SAID THE BACHELOR I WILL GIVE YOU MY LUCK AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE TAIL I HAVE ASKED THE YOUNG MINK
8324-286682-0025 WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BACHELOR WAS TO GIVE HIM HIS WHITE TIPPED TAIL NEVER MIND NOW ANSWERED THE BACHELOR AND HE TOLD THE YOUNG MINK JUST WHERE TO GNAW FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE YOUNG MINK'S TEETH ON THE WOOD OF THE TRAP
8324-286682-0026 THE BACHELOR WAS TOO BRAVE TO GROAN OR MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE KNEW THERE WAS ANYBODY AROUND TO HEAR BIG BROTHER'S MOUTH BECAME VERY SORE AND HIS STOMACH BECAME VERY EMPTY BUT STILL HE KEPT AT WORK HE WAS AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD
8324-286682-0027 COME FOR THE TRAP AND THE MINK IN IT BEFORE HE FINISHED NOW TRY IT SAID HE AFTER HE HAD GNAWED FOR QUITE A WHILE THE BACHELOR BACKED OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD BUT HIS BODY STUCK IN THE HOLE
8324-286682-0028 YOU ARE RUMPLING YOUR BEAUTIFUL FUR CRIED THE YOUNG MINK NEVER MIND THE FUR ANSWERED THE BACHELOR I CAN SMOOTH THAT DOWN AFTERWARD YOU WILL HAVE TO GNAW A LITTLE ON THIS SIDE
8324-286682-0029 AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
8324-286682-0030 BIG BROTHER GNAWED AWAY NOW TRY IT SAID HE THE BACHELOR BACKED CAREFULLY OUT THROUGH THE OPENING AND STOOD THERE LOOKING TIRED AND HUNGRY AND VERY MUCH RUMPLED YOU ARE A FINE YOUNG MINK SAID HE
8324-286682-0031 WE WILL GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT MAKING YOU LUCKY THEY WENT TO THE RIVER BANK AND HAD A GOOD DINNER THE BACHELOR ATE MORE THAN BIG BROTHER FOR HIS MOUTH WAS NOT SORE BUT BIG BROTHER WAS VERY HAPPY
8324-286682-0032 HE THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME HE WOULD LOOK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL AND HOW AFTER HE HAD THAT HE COULD SURELY MARRY WHOEVER HE WISHED IT WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG HIS PEOPLE TO WANT TO MARRY THE BEST LOOKING AND STRONGEST
8324-286682-0033 INDEED IT IS SO AMONG ALL THE POND PEOPLE AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT BEING GOOD LOOKING IT IS VERY HARD FOR A YOUNG MINK TO HAVE THE ONE HE LOVES CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER FELLOW
8324-286682-0034 HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
8324-286682-0035 THEY FOUND SUCH A PLACE AND LAY DOWN THE BACHELOR ROLLED OVER THREE TIMES AND SMOOTHED HIS FUR HE WAS STILL SO TIRED FROM BEING IN THE TRAP THEN HE LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MINK VERY SHARPLY SO YOU WANT MY TAIL
8324-286682-0036 SAID HE YOU SAID YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR LUCK ANSWERED BIG BROTHER AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOUR LUCK IS IN YOUR TAIL THE BACHELOR SMILED WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE TAIL YOU HAVE SAID HE
8324-286682-0037 I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED BIG BROTHER YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR TWO ASKED THE BACHELOR OH NO ANSWERED BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0038 WELL HOW WILL YOU PUT MY TAIL IN PLACE OF YOURS ASKED THE BACHELOR I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE YOUNG MINK BUT YOU ARE SO WISE THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
8324-286682-0039 HE BEGAN TO FEEL DISCOURAGED AND TO THINK THAT THE BACHELOR'S OFFER DIDN'T MEAN VERY MUCH AFTER ALL DON'T YOU THINK SAID THE BACHELOR SLOWLY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE MY LUCK
8324-286682-0040 YOU COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH YOUR OWN TAIL WHY YES SAID THE YOUNG MINK WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YES BUT HOW COULD THAT BE
8324-286682-0041 THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
8324-286682-0042 AND YOU CAN HAVE LUCK LIKE IT IF YOU REALLY CARE ENOUGH HE LOOKED ALL AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY WAS NEAR AND HE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE TWO LITTLE ROUND EARS THAT WERE ALMOST HIDDEN IN HIS HEAD FUR THEN HE WHISPERED TO BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0043 THIS IS THE SECRET ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING A LITTLE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN IS THAT ALL
8324-286682-0044 THAT IS ENOUGH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR KEEP TRYING AND TRYING AND TRYING UNTIL YOU CAN DIVE DEEPER STAY UNDER WATER LONGER RUN FASTER
8324-286682-0045 THEN YOU WILL HAVE GOOD LUCK WHEN THEIRS IS POOR YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY YOU CAN BEAT IN EVERY FIGHT YOU CAN HAVE SLEEK SHINING FUR
8324-286682-0046 SAID HE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE VERY BEST WAY IT WILL BE LUCK OF MY OWN OF COURSE ANSWERED THE BACHELOR
8324-286682-0047 THEN IT IS A KIND OF LUCK THAT CANNOT BE LOST IF I CARRIED MINE IN THE TIP OF MY TAIL SOMEBODY MIGHT BITE IT OFF AND LEAVE ME UNLUCKY BIG BROTHER KEPT THE SECRET
8324-286682-0048 AND WORKED UNTIL HE HAD LEARNED TO BE AS LUCKY AS THE BACHELOR THEN HE MARRIED THE PERSON HE WANTED AND SHE WAS VERY VERY HANDSOME IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THEIR SONS HAS A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
3168-173565-0000 SEVEN DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW FOUND HIMSELF IN THE AMBULANCE STATION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO HIS FEVERISH STATE AND THE INFLAMMATION OF HIS BOWELS WHICH WERE INJURED
3168-173565-0001 WERE IN THE DOCTOR'S OPINION SURE TO CARRY HIM OFF BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE ATE WITH PLEASURE A PIECE OF BREAD WITH SOME TEA AND THE DOCTOR NOTICED THAT HIS TEMPERATURE WAS LOWER HE HAD REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MORNING THE FIRST NIGHT AFTER THEY LEFT MOSCOW
3168-173565-0002 HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
3168-173565-0003 WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS CAMP BED HE LAY FOR A LONG TIME MOTIONLESS WITH CLOSED EYES THEN HE OPENED THEM AND WHISPERED SOFTLY AND THE TEA HIS REMEMBERING SUCH A SMALL DETAIL OF EVERYDAY LIFE ASTONISHED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0004 HE FELT PRINCE ANDREW'S PULSE AND TO HIS SURPRISE AND DISSATISFACTION FOUND IT HAD IMPROVED HE WAS DISSATISFIED BECAUSE HE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF HIS PATIENT DID NOT DIE NOW HE WOULD DO SO A LITTLE LATER WITH GREATER SUFFERING
3168-173565-0005 TIMOKHIN THE RED NOSED MAJOR OF PRINCE ANDREW'S REGIMENT HAD JOINED HIM IN MOSCOW AND WAS BEING TAKEN ALONG WITH HIM HAVING BEEN WOUNDED IN THE LEG AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A DOCTOR
3168-173565-0006 PRINCE ANDREW'S VALET HIS COACHMAN AND TWO ORDERLIES THEY GAVE PRINCE ANDREW SOME TEA HE DRANK IT EAGERLY LOOKING WITH FEVERISH EYES AT THE DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER SOMETHING
3168-173565-0007 I DON'T WANT ANY MORE IS TIMOKHIN HERE HE ASKED TIMOKHIN CREPT ALONG THE BENCH TO HIM I AM HERE YOUR EXCELLENCY HOW'S YOUR WOUND MINE SIR
3168-173565-0008 PRINCE ANDREW AGAIN PONDERED AS IF TRYING TO REMEMBER SOMETHING COULDN'T ONE GET A BOOK HE ASKED WHAT BOOK THE GOSPELS I HAVEN'T ONE
3168-173565-0009 THE DOCTOR PROMISED TO PROCURE IT FOR HIM AND BEGAN TO ASK HOW HE WAS FEELING PRINCE ANDREW ANSWERED ALL HIS QUESTIONS RELUCTANTLY BUT REASONABLY
3168-173565-0010 AND THEN SAID HE WANTED A BOLSTER PLACED UNDER HIM AS HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND IN GREAT PAIN THE DOCTOR AND VALET LIFTED THE CLOAK WITH WHICH HE WAS COVERED AND MAKING WRY FACES AT THE NOISOME SMELL OF MORTIFYING FLESH
3168-173565-0011 THAT CAME FROM THE WOUND BEGAN EXAMINING THAT DREADFUL PLACE THE DOCTOR WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED ABOUT SOMETHING AND MADE A CHANGE IN THE DRESSINGS TURNING THE WOUNDED MAN OVER SO THAT HE GROANED AGAIN AND GREW UNCONSCIOUS AND DELIRIOUS FROM THE AGONY
3168-173565-0012 HE KEPT ASKING THEM TO GET HIM THE BOOK AND PUT IT UNDER HIM WHAT TROUBLE WOULD IT BE TO YOU HE SAID
3168-173565-0013 HE PLEADED IN A PITEOUS VOICE THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE PASSAGE TO WASH HIS HANDS YOU FELLOWS HAVE NO CONSCIENCE SAID HE TO THE VALET WHO WAS POURING WATER OVER HIS HANDS
3168-173565-0014 THAT I WONDER HOW HE CAN BEAR IT BY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST I THOUGHT WE HAD PUT SOMETHING UNDER HIM SAID THE VALET THE FIRST TIME PRINCE ANDREW UNDERSTOOD WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND REMEMBERED BEING WOUNDED AND HOW
3168-173565-0015 WAS WHEN HE ASKED TO BE CARRIED INTO THE HUT AFTER HIS CALECHE HAD STOPPED AT MYTISHCHI AFTER GROWING CONFUSED FROM PAIN WHILE BEING CARRIED INTO THE HUT HE AGAIN REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHILE DRINKING TEA ONCE MORE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
3168-173565-0016 AND ABOVE ALL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED THE MOMENT AT THE AMBULANCE STATION WHEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF A MAN HE DISLIKED THOSE NEW THOUGHTS HAD COME TO HIM WHICH PROMISED HIM HAPPINESS AND THOSE
3168-173565-0017 THOUGHTS THOUGH NOW VAGUE AND INDEFINITE AGAIN POSSESSED HIS SOUL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOW A NEW SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND THAT THIS HAPPINESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GOSPELS THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM
3168-173565-0018 THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IN WHICH THEY HAD PUT HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AGAIN CONFUSED HIS THOUGHTS AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF A THIRD TIME IT WAS IN THE COMPLETE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT EVERYBODY NEAR HIM WAS SLEEPING A CRICKET CHIRPED FROM ACROSS THE PASSAGE
3168-173565-0019 SOMEONE WAS SHOUTING AND SINGING IN THE STREET COCKROACHES RUSTLED ON THE TABLE ON THE ICONS AND ON THE WALLS AND A BIG FLY FLOPPED AT THE HEAD OF THE BED AND AROUND THE CANDLE BESIDE HIM THE WICK OF WHICH WAS CHARRED AND HAD SHAPED ITSELF LIKE A MUSHROOM
3168-173565-0020 HIS MIND WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE A HEALTHY MAN USUALLY THINKS OF FEELS AND REMEMBERS INNUMERABLE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT HAS THE POWER AND WILL TO SELECT ONE SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS OR EVENTS ON WHICH TO FIX HIS WHOLE ATTENTION
3168-173565-0021 A HEALTHY MAN CAN TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE DEEPEST REFLECTIONS TO SAY A CIVIL WORD TO SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND CAN THEN RETURN AGAIN TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS
3168-173565-0022 ALL THE POWERS OF HIS MIND WERE MORE ACTIVE AND CLEARER THAN EVER BUT THEY ACTED APART FROM HIS WILL MOST DIVERSE THOUGHTS AND IMAGES OCCUPIED HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY AT TIMES HIS BRAIN SUDDENLY BEGAN TO WORK WITH A VIGOR CLEARNESS AND DEPTH
3168-173565-0023 IT HAD NEVER REACHED WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH BUT SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORK IT WOULD TURN TO SOME UNEXPECTED IDEA AND HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN YES A NEW HAPPINESS WAS REVEALED TO ME OF WHICH MAN CANNOT BE DEPRIVED
3168-173565-0024 HE THOUGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE QUIET HUT GAZING FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM WITH FEVERISH WIDE OPEN EYES A HAPPINESS LYING BEYOND MATERIAL FORCES OUTSIDE THE MATERIAL INFLUENCES THAT ACT ON MAN
3168-173565-0025 EVERY MAN CAN UNDERSTAND IT BUT TO CONCEIVE IT AND ENJOIN IT WAS POSSIBLE ONLY FOR GOD BUT HOW DID GOD ENJOIN THAT LAW AND WHY WAS THE SON AND SUDDENLY THE SEQUENCE OF THESE THOUGHTS BROKE OFF
3168-173565-0026 AND PRINCE ANDREW HEARD WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER IT WAS A DELUSION OR REALITY A SOFT WHISPERING VOICE INCESSANTLY AND RHYTHMICALLY REPEATING PITI PITI PITI AND THEN
3168-173565-0027 AND TI TI ONCE MORE AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT ABOVE HIS FACE ABOVE THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT SOME STRANGE AIRY STRUCTURE WAS BEING ERECTED OUT OF SLENDER NEEDLES OR SPLINTERS
3168-173565-0028 TO THE SOUND OF THIS WHISPERED MUSIC HE FELT THAT HE HAD TO BALANCE CAREFULLY THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT SO THAT THIS AIRY STRUCTURE SHOULD NOT COLLAPSE BUT NEVERTHELESS IT KEPT COLLAPSING AND AGAIN SLOWLY RISING TO THE SOUND OF
3168-173565-0029 WHISPERED RHYTHMIC MUSIC IT STRETCHES STRETCHES SPREADING OUT AND STRETCHING SAID PRINCE ANDREW TO HIMSELF WHILE LISTENING TO THIS WHISPERING AND FEELING THE SENSATION OF THIS DRAWING OUT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS EDIFICE OF NEEDLES
3168-173565-0030 HE ALSO SAW BY GLIMPSES A RED HALO ROUND THE CANDLE AND HEARD THE RUSTLE OF THE COCKROACHES AND THE BUZZING OF THE FLY THAT FLOPPED AGAINST HIS PILLOW AND HIS FACE
3168-173565-0031 EACH TIME THE FLY TOUCHED HIS FACE IT GAVE HIM A BURNING SENSATION AND YET TO HIS SURPRISE IT DID NOT DESTROY THE STRUCTURE THOUGH IT KNOCKED AGAINST THE VERY REGION OF HIS FACE WHERE IT WAS RISING
3168-173565-0032 WHICH ALSO OPPRESSED HIM BUT PERHAPS THAT'S MY SHIRT ON THE TABLE HE THOUGHT AND THAT'S MY LEGS AND THAT IS THE DOOR BUT WHY IS IT ALWAYS STRETCHING AND DRAWING ITSELF OUT AND
3168-173565-0033 PITI PITI PITI AND TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI THAT'S ENOUGH PLEASE LEAVE OFF PRINCE ANDREW PAINFULLY ENTREATED SOMEONE AND SUDDENLY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AGAIN SWAM TO THE SURFACE OF HIS MIND WITH PECULIAR CLEARNESS AND FORCE
3168-173565-0034 FOR SOME PURPOSE OR FOR SOME REASON BUT THE LOVE WHICH I WHILE DYING FIRST EXPERIENCED WHEN I SAW MY ENEMY AND YET LOVED HIM I EXPERIENCED THAT FEELING OF LOVE WHICH IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL AND DOES NOT REQUIRE AN OBJECT
3168-173565-0035 NOW AGAIN I FEEL THAT BLISS TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS
3168-173565-0036 BUT AN ENEMY CAN ONLY BE LOVED BY DIVINE LOVE
3168-173565-0037 IS HE ALIVE WHEN LOVING WITH HUMAN LOVE ONE MAY PASS FROM LOVE TO HATRED BUT DIVINE LOVE CANNOT CHANGE NO NEITHER DEATH NOR ANYTHING ELSE CAN DESTROY IT IT IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE SOUL
3168-173565-0038 YET HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE I HATED IN MY LIFE AND OF THEM ALL I LOVED AND HATED NONE AS I DID HER
3168-173565-0039 NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
3168-173565-0040 IF ONLY IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE HER ONCE MORE JUST ONCE LOOKING INTO THOSE EYES TO SAY PITI PITI PITI AND
3168-173565-0041 TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI BOOM FLOPPED THE FLY AND HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CARRIED INTO ANOTHER WORLD
3168-173565-0042 AND DELIRIUM IN WHICH SOMETHING PARTICULAR WAS HAPPENING IN THAT WORLD SOME STRUCTURE WAS STILL BEING ERECTED AND DID NOT FALL SOMETHING WAS STILL STRETCHING OUT AND THE CANDLE WITH ITS RED HALO WAS STILL BURNING
3168-173565-0043 BUT BESIDES ALL THIS SOMETHING CREAKED THERE WAS A WHIFF OF FRESH AIR AND A NEW WHITE SPHINX APPEARED STANDING AT THE DOOR AND THAT SPHINX HAD THE PALE FACE AND SHINING EYES OF THE VERY NATASHA OF WHOM HE HAD JUST BEEN THINKING
3168-173565-0044 OH HOW OPPRESSIVE THIS CONTINUAL DELIRIUM IS THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO DRIVE THAT FACE FROM HIS IMAGINATION BUT THE FACE REMAINED BEFORE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF REALITY AND DREW NEARER
3168-173565-0045 BUT HE COULD NOT AND DELIRIUM DREW HIM BACK INTO ITS DOMAIN THE SOFT WHISPERING VOICE CONTINUED ITS RHYTHMIC MURMUR SOMETHING OPPRESSED HIM AND STRETCHED OUT AND THE STRANGE FACE WAS BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0046 HE MOVED A LITTLE AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A RINGING IN HIS EARS
3168-173565-0047 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF NATASHA THAT SAME LIVING NATASHA WHOM OF ALL PEOPLE HE MOST LONGED TO LOVE WITH THIS NEW PURE DIVINE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WAS KNEELING BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0048 HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE REAL LIVING NATASHA AND HE WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT QUIETLY HAPPY NATASHA MOTIONLESS ON HER KNEES SHE WAS UNABLE TO STIR
3168-173565-0049 WITH FRIGHTENED EYES RIVETED ON HIM WAS RESTRAINING HER SOBS HER FACE WAS PALE AND RIGID ONLY IN THE LOWER PART OF IT SOMETHING QUIVERED PRINCE ANDREW SIGHED WITH RELIEF SMILED
3168-173565-0050 AND HELD OUT HIS HAND YOU HE SAID HOW FORTUNATE WITH A RAPID BUT CAREFUL MOVEMENT NATASHA DREW NEARER TO HIM ON HER KNEES AND TAKING HIS HAND CAREFULLY
3168-173565-0051 JUST TOUCHING IT LIGHTLY WITH HER LIPS FORGIVE ME SHE WHISPERED RAISING HER HEAD AND GLANCING AT HIM FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU SAID PRINCE ANDREW
3168-173565-0052 FORGIVE WHAT HE ASKED
3168-173565-0053 BROKEN WHISPER AND BEGAN KISSING HIS HAND MORE RAPIDLY JUST TOUCHING IT WITH HER LIPS I LOVE YOU MORE BETTER THAN BEFORE SAID PRINCE ANDREW LIFTING HER FACE WITH HIS HAND
3168-173565-0054 SO AS TO LOOK INTO HER EYES THOSE EYES FILLED WITH HAPPY TEARS GAZED AT HIM TIMIDLY COMPASSIONATELY AND WITH JOYOUS LOVE NATASHA'S THIN PALE FACE WITH ITS SWOLLEN LIPS
3168-173565-0055 WAS MORE THAN PLAIN IT WAS DREADFUL BUT PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE THAT HE SAW HER SHINING EYES WHICH WERE BEAUTIFUL THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES BEHIND THEM PETER THE VALET WHO WAS NOW WIDE AWAKE HAD ROUSED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0056 TIMOKHIN WHO HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN HIS LEG HAD LONG BEEN WATCHING ALL THAT WAS GOING ON CAREFULLY COVERING HIS BARE BODY WITH THE SHEET AS HE HUDDLED UP ON HIS BENCH WHAT'S THIS SAID THE DOCTOR RISING FROM HIS BED
3168-173565-0057 PLEASE GO AWAY MADAM AT THAT MOMENT A MAID SENT BY THE COUNTESS WHO HAD NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
3168-173565-0058 FELL SOBBING ON HER BED FROM THAT TIME DURING ALL THE REST OF THE ROSTOVS JOURNEY AT EVERY HALTING PLACE AND WHEREVER THEY SPENT A NIGHT NATASHA NEVER LEFT THE WOUNDED BOLKONSKI
3168-173565-0059 AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED FROM A YOUNG GIRL EITHER SUCH FIRMNESS OR SUCH SKILL IN NURSING A WOUNDED MAN DREADFUL AS THE COUNTESS IMAGINED IT WOULD BE SHOULD PRINCE ANDREW DIE IN HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS DURING THE JOURNEY
3168-173565-0060 AS JUDGING BY WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED MIGHT EASILY HAPPEN SHE COULD NOT OPPOSE NATASHA THOUGH WITH THE INTIMACY NOW ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE WOUNDED MAN AND NATASHA THE THOUGHT OCCURRED THAT SHOULD HE RECOVER THEIR FORMER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE RENEWED
3168-173565-0061 NO ONE LEAST OF ALL NATASHA AND PRINCE ANDREW SPOKE OF THIS THE UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LIFE AND DEATH WHICH HUNG NOT ONLY OVER BOLKONSKI BUT OVER ALL RUSSIA
226-131533-0000 YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
226-131533-0001 SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
226-131533-0002 AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
226-131533-0003 YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
226-131533-0004 AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
226-131533-0005 AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
226-131533-0006 YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
226-131533-0007 WELL BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH MISSUS GRAHAM WHY ROSE ARE YOU TOO GIVING IN TO THE PREVAILING OPINION NO RETURNED SHE HESITATINGLY
226-131533-0008 BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
226-131533-0009 AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
226-131533-0010 WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
226-131533-0011 FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
226-131533-0012 UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL
226-131533-0013 YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
226-131533-0014 AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
226-131533-0015 MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
226-131533-0016 JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
226-131533-0017 BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
226-131533-0018 AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
226-131533-0019 BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
226-131533-0020 AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
226-131533-0021 AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
226-131533-0022 IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
226-131533-0023 WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
226-131533-0024 IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
226-131533-0025 IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
226-131533-0026 WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
226-131533-0027 REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
226-131533-0028 AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR MISSUS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE
226-131533-0029 THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
226-131533-0030 AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
226-131533-0031 BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
226-131533-0032 NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
226-131533-0033 BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
226-131533-0034 SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
226-131533-0035 THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
226-131533-0036 I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
226-131532-0000 WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
226-131532-0001 AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
226-131532-0002 THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
226-131532-0003 AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
226-131532-0004 NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
226-131532-0005 WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
226-131532-0006 AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
226-131532-0007 THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
226-131532-0008 OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
226-131532-0009 WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
226-131532-0010 MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
226-131532-0011 HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
226-131532-0012 THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
226-131532-0013 WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
226-131532-0014 I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY YES
226-131532-0015 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
226-131532-0016 AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
226-131532-0017 BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
226-131532-0018 AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
226-131532-0019 A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
226-131532-0020 NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE
226-131532-0021 AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE
226-131532-0022 THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
226-131532-0023 AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
226-131532-0024 I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
226-131532-0025 PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
226-131532-0026 BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
226-131532-0027 AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
226-131532-0028 YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
226-131532-0029 IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
226-131532-0030 BUT I QUICKLY RE CAPTURED THE PONY SCARCE LESS ASTONISHED THAN ITS MASTER AT SUCH UNCIVIL USAGE REALLY MISTER MARKHAM THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LATTER CAN I NOT GO TO SEE MY TENANT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED IN THIS MANNER BY
226-131532-0031 AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
226-131532-0032 WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
226-131532-0033 BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
226-131532-0034 WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
8425-291444-0000 OF THIS VENERABLE AND ANCIENT CITY GRADUALLY SLIPPING FROM OUR GRASP TREMBLING ON THE LIPS OF NARRATIVE OLD AGE AND DAY BY DAY DROPPING PIECEMEAL INTO THE TOMB IN A LITTLE WHILE THOUGHT I AND THOSE REVERED DUTCH BURGHERS
8425-291444-0001 WHO SERVE AS THE TOTTERING MONUMENTS OF GOOD OLD TIMES WILL BE GATHERED TO THEIR FATHERS THEIR CHILDREN ENGROSSED BY THE EMPTY PLEASURES OR INSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRESENT AGE WILL NEGLECT TO TREASURE UP THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST
8425-291444-0002 AND POSTERITY WILL SEARCH IN VAIN FOR MEMORIALS OF THE DAYS OF THE PATRIARCHS THE ORIGIN OF OUR CITY WILL BE BURIED IN ETERNAL OBLIVION AND EVEN THE NAMES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF WOUTER VAN TWILLER
8425-291444-0003 STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THOUGH SUCH MULTITUDES OF EXCELLENT WORKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE NONE EXTANT WHICH GIVE ANY FULL AND SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF NEW YORK
8425-291444-0004 OR OF ITS THREE FIRST DUTCH GOVERNORS I HAVE HOWEVER GAINED MUCH VALUABLE AND CURIOUS MATTER FROM AN ELABORATE MANUSCRIPT WRITTEN
8425-291444-0005 EXCEPTING A FEW ERRORS IN ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE STUYVESANT FAMILY MANY LEGENDS LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS HAVE I LIKEWISE GLEANED IN MY RESEARCHES AMONG THE FAMILY CHESTS AND LUMBER GARRETS OF OUR RESPECTABLE
8425-291444-0006 BY THAT ADMIRABLE AND PRAISEWORTHY INSTITUTION THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY TO WHICH I HERE PUBLICLY RETURN MY SINCERE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IN THE CONDUCT OF THIS INESTIMABLE WORK I HAVE ADOPTED NO INDIVIDUAL MODEL
8425-291444-0007 AND THE STRICTEST ADHERENCE TO TRUTH THROUGHOUT MY HISTORY I HAVE ENRICHED IT AFTER THE MANNER OF SALLUST WITH VARIOUS CHARACTERS OF ANCIENT WORTHIES DRAWN AT FULL LENGTH AND FAITHFULLY COLORED
8425-291444-0008 SWEETENED IT WITH THE GRACES OF SENTIMENT LIKE TACITUS AND INFUSED INTO THE WHOLE THE DIGNITY THE GRANDEUR AND MAGNIFICENCE OF LIVY I AM AWARE THAT I SHALL INCUR THE CENSURE OF NUMEROUS VERY LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS CRITICS FOR
8425-291444-0009 OF THE HISTORIAN AND ENTICE HIM TO TURN ASIDE AND REFRESH HIMSELF FROM HIS WAYFARING BUT I TRUST IT WILL BE FOUND THAT I HAVE ALWAYS RESUMED MY STAFF AND ADDRESSED MYSELF TO MY WEARY JOURNEY WITH RENOVATED SPIRITS
8425-291444-0010 YET THE LOOSE AND UNCONNECTED MANNER IN WHICH MANY OF THE FACTS HEREIN RECORDED HAVE COME TO HAND RENDERED SUCH AN ATTEMPT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THIS DIFFICULTY WAS LIKEWISE INCREASED BY ONE OF THE GRAND OBJECTS CONTEMPLATED IN MY WORK
8425-291444-0011 BUT THE CHIEF MERIT ON WHICH I VALUE MYSELF AND FOUND MY HOPES FOR FUTURE REGARD IS THAT FAITHFUL VERACITY WITH WHICH I HAVE COMPILED THIS INVALUABLE LITTLE WORK
8425-291444-0012 CAREFULLY WINNOWING AWAY THE CHAFF OF HYPOTHESIS AND DISCARDING THE TARES OF FABLE WHICH ARE TOO APT TO SPRING UP AND CHOKE THE SEEDS OF TRUTH AND WHOLESOME KNOWLEDGE HAD I BEEN ANXIOUS TO CAPTIVATE THE SUPERFICIAL THRONG
8425-291444-0013 THE INFANT YEARS OF OUR CITY TO INTRODUCE A THOUSAND PLEASING FICTIONS BUT I HAVE SCRUPULOUSLY DISCARDED MANY A PITHY TALE AND MARVELOUS ADVENTURE WHEREBY THE DROWSY EAR OF SUMMER INDOLENCE MIGHT BE ENTHRALLED
8425-291444-0014 JEALOUSLY MAINTAINING THAT FIDELITY GRAVITY AND DIGNITY WHICH SHOULD EVER DISTINGUISH THE HISTORIAN FOR A WRITER OF THIS CLASS OBSERVES AN ELEGANT CRITIC MUST SUSTAIN THE CHARACTER OF A WISE MAN WRITING FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF POSTERITY
8425-291444-0015 TO DECAY WHO GATHERS TOGETHER THEIR SCATTERED FRAGMENTS AS THEY ROT AND WHO PIOUSLY AT LENGTH COLLECTS THEIR ASHES INTO THE MAUSOLEUM OF HIS WORK AND REARS A TRIUMPHANT MONUMENT
8425-291444-0016 TO TRANSMIT THEIR RENOWN TO ALL SUCCEEDING AGES WHAT HAS BEEN THE FATE OF MANY FAIR CITIES OF ANTIQUITY WHOSE NAMELESS RUINS ENCUMBER THE PLAINS OF EUROPE AND ASIA AND AWAKEN THE FRUITLESS INQUIRY OF THE TRAVELER
8425-291444-0017 THEY HAVE PERISHED FROM REMEMBRANCE FOR WANT OF A HISTORIAN THE PHILANTHROPIST MAY WEEP OVER THEIR DESOLATION THE POET MAY WANDER AMONG THEIR MOULDERING ARCHES AND BROKEN COLUMNS
8425-291444-0018 AND INDULGE THE VISIONARY FLIGHTS OF HIS FANCY BUT ALAS ALAS THE MODERN HISTORIAN WHOSE PEN LIKE MY OWN IS DOOMED TO CONFINE ITSELF TO DULL MATTER OF FACT
8425-291444-0019 REUNITE THE THREAD OF GENERATIONS THE SAME SAD MISFORTUNE WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO SO MANY ANCIENT CITIES WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND FROM THE SAME SAD CAUSE TO NINE TENTHS OF THOSE WHICH NOW FLOURISH ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
8425-292520-0000 THE BRIDGE THE LONELY BRIDGE CUTS DARK ACROSS THE MARSH
8425-292520-0001 PALELY REFLECTED IN THE AMBER COLORED WATER AMONG THEM A CONSTANT BANJO TWANGING OF FROGS AND SHRILLING
8425-292520-0002 DARK WITH CRUMBLING RAILING AND PLANKS THE BRIDGE LEADS INTO THE SUNSET ACROSS IT MANY LONELY FIGURES THEIR EYES A FLARE WITH THE SUNSET THEIR FACES GLOWING WITH ITS COLORS

8425-292520-0007 TILL WITH DISTANCE DIMMING IT FADES AWAY AMONG THE SILENT DARK ARRAY OF CITY HOUSES WHERE NO SOUL STIRS
8425-292520-0008 AS I GO HASTILY BY IN THE TURBULENT DARKNESS AN OVAL OLIVE FACE WITH THE SWEETLY SULLEN GRACE OF THE VIRGIN WHEN FIRST SHE SEES AMID HER GARDEN'S SILVER LILIES THE WHITE ROBED ANGEL GLEAM
8425-292520-0009 AN OLD ITALIAN PAINTER LABORIOUSLY HAS PLAYED HIS SOUL AWAY HIS LOVE ALL HIS DESIRE FOR FRAGRANT THINGS AFAR FROM EARTH SHINES THE MADONNA AS WITH A VEIL OVERLAID BY INCENSE SMOKE AND DUST AGE OLD
8425-292520-0010 AT WHOSE FEET IN TIME OF DEARTH OR NEED A MYRIAD MEN HAVE LAID THEIR SORROWS AND ARISEN BOLD INCESSANTLY THE LONG RAIN FALLS SLANTING ON BLACK WALLS BUT THROUGH THE DARK INTERMINABLE STREETS
8425-292520-0011 ALONG PAVEMENTS WHERE RAIN BEATS ITS SHARP TATTOO AND GAS LAMPS SHINE GREENISH GOLD IN THE SOLITUDE THE VISION FLAMES THROUGH MY MOOD OF THAT ITALIAN WOMAN'S FACE
8425-292520-0012 MEMORY BETWEEN ROUNDED HILLS WHITE WITH PATCHES OF BUCKWHEAT WHOSE FRAGRANCE FILLS THE LITTLE BREEZE THAT MAKES THE BIRCH LEAVES QUIVER BESIDE A ROLLICKING SWIFT RIVER
8425-292520-0013 LIGHT GREEN IN THE DEEPS LIKE YOUR EYES IN SUNSHINE WINDS THE CANAL LAZY AND BROWN AS A WATER SNAKE FULL OF DAZZLE AND SHEEN WHERE THE BREEZE SWEEPS THE WATER WITH GOSSAMER GARMENTS THAT SHAKE THE REEDS STANDING SENTINEL
8425-292520-0014 AND THE MARGINAL LINE OF BIRCHES AND WILLOWS OUR LITTLE STEAMER PULLS ITS WAY WITH JINGLE OF BELLS AND PANTING THROB OF OLD ENGINES IN STIFF ARRAY THE WATER REEDS WAVE AND SOLEMNLY SWAY TO THE WASH AND SWELL OF OUR PASSING

8425-292520-0016 I STOOD BESIDE YOU IN THE BOW WATCHED THE SUNLIGHT LOSE ITSELF AMONG YOUR HAIR THAT THE BREEZE TUGGED AT BRIGHT AS THE SHATTERED SUN RAYS WHERE THE PROW CUT THE STILL WATER THE WARM LIGHT CAUGHT AND TANGLED THERE
8425-292520-0017 EDUCATION AGREED THAT UNLESS SOMETHING WERE CHANGED DISASTER WOULD COME TO THE NATION YOU SMILED WHEN I POINTED WHERE A GROUP OF BIRCHES SHIVERED IN THE GREEN WOOD SHADOW UP TO THEIR KNEES IN WATER
8425-292520-0018 WHITE AND FAIR AS DRYADS BATHING A ROW OF FLAT WHITE HOUSES AND A WHARF GLIDED IN SIGHT THE HOARSE WHISTLE SHRIEKED FOR A LANDING BELLS JANGLED
8425-292520-0019 THE LAKE WAVES WERE FLAKES OF RED GOLD BURNISHED TO COPPER GOLD RED AS THE TANGLED GLEAM OF SUNLIGHT IN YOUR HAIR SATURNALIA
8425-292520-0020 IN MEN'S HEARTS THE MAD GODS RISE AND FILL THE STREETS WITH REVELLING WITH TORCHLIGHT THAT GLANCES ON FROZEN POOLS WITH TAPERS STARRING THE THICK FOGGED NIGHT A DANCE LIKE STRAYED FIREFLIES
8425-292520-0021 TO EARTH'S BROOD OF SOULS OF OLD WITH COVERED HEADS AND ASPEN WANDS MIST SHROUDED PRIESTS DO ANCIENT RITES THE BLACK RAM'S FLEECE IS STAINED WITH BLOOD THAT STEAMS DULL RED ON THE FROZEN GROUND

8425-292520-0023 IS IT THE SONG OF A MEADOW LARK OFF THE BROWN SERE SALT MARSHES OR THE EAGER PATCHES IN DOORYARDS OF YELLOW AND PALE LILAC CROCUSES
8425-292520-0024 RHYTHMED CLANK OF TRAIN COUPLINGS AT NIGHT AND THE STORMY GAY TINTED SUNRISES THAT SHADE WITH PURPLE THE CONTOURS OF FAR OFF UNFAMILIAR HILLS NIGHT PIECE
8425-292520-0025 A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB UPON ALL THE SKY WHERE THE FRAIL STARS QUIVER EVERY ONE LIKE TANGLED GNATS THAT HUM AND DIE
8425-292520-0026 THE MOON HAS TANGLED THE DULL NIGHT IN HER SILVER SKEIN AND SET ALIGHT EACH DEW DAMP BRANCH WITH MILKY FLAME AND HUGE THE MOON BROODS ON THE NIGHT MY SOUL IS CAUGHT IN THE WEB OF THE MOON
8425-292520-0027 BEHIND THOSE WALLS IN THOSE DARK STREETS LIKE THE SOUND OF A RIVER SWIFT UNSEEN FLOWING IN DARKNESS OH THE HOARSE HALF HEARD MURMUR SWIRLING BENEATH THE SNOWY BEAUTY OF MOONLIGHT
8425-292520-0028 LOW A GREY MOON SHROUDED IN SEA FOG AIR PREGNANT WITH SPRING RASP OF MY STEPS BESIDE THE LAPPING WATER WITHIN THE DARK
8425-292520-0029 DOWN THE WORN OUT YEARS A SOB OF BROKEN LOVES OLD PAIN OF DEAD FAREWELLS AND ONE FACE FADING INTO GREY A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB OVER ALL THE SKY
8425-287387-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT DUCO VAN DER STAAL HAD TAKEN A LARGE VAULT LIKE STUDIO WITH A CHILLY NORTH LIGHT UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN THE VIA DEL BABUINO HERE HE PAINTED MODELLED AND STUDIED
8425-287387-0001 IN THE LITTLE SHOPS ALONG THE TIBER OR IN THE MERCATO DEI FIORI THAT WAS HIS PASSION TO HUNT THROUGH ROME FOR A PANEL OF AN OLD TRIPTYCH OR A FRAGMENT OF ANCIENT SCULPTURE
8425-287387-0002 IN THIS WAY HIS STUDIO HAD NOT REMAINED THE LARGE CHILLY VAULT LIKE WORKROOM BEARING WITNESS TO ZEALOUS AND SERIOUS STUDY BUT HAD BECOME A REFUGE FOR DIM COLOURED REMNANTS OF ANTIQUITY
8425-287387-0003 AND ANCIENT ART A MUSEUM FOR HIS DREAMING SPIRIT ALREADY AS A CHILD AS A BOY HE HAD FELT THAT PASSION FOR ANTIQUITY DEVELOPING HE LEARNT HOW TO RUMMAGE THROUGH THE STOCKS OF OLD JEWISH DEALERS
8425-287387-0004 HE SPENT ALL HIS POCKET MONEY ON IT AND LATER WITHOUT RESERVE THE LITTLE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO EARN FOR SOMETIMES VERY SELDOM HE WOULD FINISH SOMETHING AND SELL IT
8425-287387-0005 WHEN HE HAD THE MONEY TO KEEP HIMSELF GOING AND HIS PERSONAL NEEDS WERE VERY SMALL HE FELT RICH AND WAS CONTENT IN HIS STUDIO OR WOULD WANDER PERFECTLY CONTENT THROUGH THE STREETS OF ROME
8425-287387-0006 AND HIS FAVOURITE HEADGEAR WAS A FADED HAT BATTERED OUT OF SHAPE BY THE RAIN
8425-287387-0007 HE WOULD WANDER FOR HOURS THROUGH THE RUINS AND SEE IN A DAZZLING VISION OF PHANTOM COLUMNS ETHEREAL TEMPLES AND TRANSLUCENT MARBLE PALACES LOOMING UP IN A SHIMMERING SUNLIT TWILIGHT AND THE TOURISTS GOING BY WITH THEIR BAEDEKERS
8425-287387-0008 WHO PASSED THIS LONG LEAN YOUNG MAN SEATED CARELESSLY ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE OF SATURN WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN HIS ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSIONS OF HARMONIOUS ASCENDING LINES CROWNED BY AN ARRAY OF STATUES IN NOBLE
8425-287387-0009 AND GOD LIKE ATTITUDES HIGH IN THE BLUE SKY BUT HE SAW THEM BEFORE HIM HE RAISED THE SHAFTS OF THE PILLARS HE FLUTED THE SEVERE DORIC COLUMNS HE BENT AND CURVED THE CUSHIONED IONIC CAPITALS
8425-287387-0010 THE TEMPLES ROSE IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE BASILICAS SHOT UP AS BY MAGIC THE GRAVEN IMAGES STOOD WHITE AGAINST THE ELUSIVE DEPTHS OF THE SKY AND THE VIA SACRA BECAME ALIVE
8425-287387-0011 HE IN HIS ADMIRATION LIVED HIS DREAM HIS PAST IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD KNOWN PREEXISTENCE IN ANCIENT ROME AND THE MODERN HOUSES THE MODERN CAPITOL
8425-287387-0012 ROMAN LIFE CAME INTO BEING WITH A TOGA'D GESTURE A LINE OF HORACE A SUDDEN VISION OF AN EMPEROR'S MURDER
8425-287387-0013 EATEN UP WITH AGE CRUMBLED MARTYRED MUTILATED WITH HAMMERS TILL ONLY A FEW OCCASIONAL PILLARS LIFTED AND BORE A TREMBLING ARCHITRAVE THAT THREATENED TO COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND
8425-287387-0014 AND THE BROWNS AND GREYS WERE SO RICHLY AND NOBLY GILDED BY SPLASHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RUINS WERE SO EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL IN DECAY SO MELANCHOLY IN THEIR UNWITTING FORTUITOUSNESS OF BROKEN LINES
8425-287387-0015 AND CAUSED THEM TO BURST ASUNDER AND SHAKE AND TREMBLE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR WISTFUL AFTERMATH OF BEAUTY THEN HIS EYES GREW MOIST HIS HEART BECAME MORE FULL THAN HE COULD BEAR
8425-287387-0016 AND HE WENT AWAY THROUGH THE ARCH OF TITUS BY THE COLOSSEUM THROUGH THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE
8425-287387-0017 NEITHER IN HIS MOTHER NOR IN HIS SISTERS DID HE FIND A STRAIN THAT SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS ECCENTRIC TENDENCIES AND SINCE THAT ONE FRIEND WHO DIED HE HAD NEVER FOUND ANOTHER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN LONELY WITHIN
8425-287387-0018 AND WITHOUT AS THOUGH THE VICTIM OF A PREDESTINATION WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO MEET WITH SYMPATHY BUT HE HAD PEOPLED HIS LONELINESS SO DENSELY WITH HIS DREAMS THAT HE HAD NEVER FELT UNHAPPY BECAUSE OF IT
8425-287387-0019 AND EVEN AS HE LOVED ROAMING ALONE AMONG THE RUINS AND ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS SO HE CHERISHED THE PRIVACY OF HIS LONELY STUDIO WITH THE MANY SILENT FIGURES ON AN OLD PANEL OF SOME TRIPTYCH
8425-287387-0020 ON A TAPESTRY OR ON THE MANY CLOSELY HUNG SKETCHES ALL AROUND HIM ALL WITH THE CHARM OF THEIR LINES
8425-287387-0021 OR A SHADOWY ANTIQUE CABINET AND IN BETWEEN ALL THIS LIVED HIS CHINA AND BRONZE AND OLD SILVER WHILE THE FADED GOLD EMBROIDERY OF AN ECCLESIASTICAL VESTMENT GLEAMED FAINTLY
8425-287387-0022 AND THE OLD LEATHER BINDINGS OF HIS BOOKS STOOD IN COMFORTABLE BROWN ROWS READY TO GIVE FORTH WHEN HIS HANDS OPENED THEM IMAGES WHICH MISTILY DRIFTED UPWARDS LIVING THEIR LOVES AND THEIR SORROWS IN THE TEMPERED BROWNS AND REDS AND GOLDS
8425-287387-0023 OF THE SOUNDLESS ATMOSPHERE OF THE STUDIO SUCH WAS HIS SIMPLE LIFE WITHOUT MUCH INWARD DOUBTING BECAUSE HE MADE NO GREAT DEMANDS UPON HIMSELF AND WITHOUT THE MODERN ARTIST'S MELANCHOLY
8425-287387-0024 BEING BY NATURE A LITTLE SHY OF BAEDEKERED TOURISTS OF SHORT SKIRTED ENGLISH LADIES WITH THEIR PERSISTENT LITTLE EXCLAMATIONS OF UNIFORM ADMIRATION AND FEELING ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE HALF ITALIAN
8425-287387-0025 HALF COSMOPOLITAN SET OF HIS RATHER WORLDLY MOTHER AND SMART LITTLE SISTERS WHO SPENT THEIR TIME DANCING AND CYCLING WITH YOUNG ITALIAN PRINCES AND DUKES
8425-287387-0026 AND AGAIN UNTIL IN HIS MUSING HE SEEMED TO HEAR IT ONCE MORE ON HER OWN LIPS UNTIL SHE JOINED THE BUSTS AND TORSOS IN HIS STUDIO AND APPEARED BEFORE HIM IN THE LILY LIKE FRAILNESS OF HER VISIBLE ACTUALITY
8425-287387-0027 AGAINST THE PRERAPHAELITE STIFFNESS OF LINE
8425-287387-0028 HIS LIFE HAD NEVER KNOWN MORE THAN THE NATURAL VIRILE IMPULSE AND THE ORDINARY LITTLE LOVE AFFAIR WITH A MODEL
8425-287387-0029 AND UNREAL BALANCE BETWEEN A WOMAN WHO SHOWED HERSELF IN THE NUDE FOR A FEW LIRE AND PETRARCH'S LAURA
8425-287387-0030 AND PREGNANT SENSE OF THE WORD AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO THINK AND TO THINK LONG AND OFTEN OF CORNELIE DE RETZ
8425-287387-0031 AND DREAMED FOR DAYS FOR A WEEK ABOUT A WOMAN IN A POEM
8425-287387-0032 NEVER AND THAT HE IRRITATED BY SOME OF HER SAYINGS HAD NEVERTHELESS SEEN HER STAND WITH HER LILY LIKE OUTLINE
8095-274348-0000 AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
8095-274348-0001 HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
8095-274348-0002 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PRINCESS AND THE DUKE PRESUMED SO FAR ON HER GOOD GRACES THAT AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE SECRETLY RETURNED UPON SOME PRETENCE AND PAYING A VISIT TO THE QUEEN
8095-274348-0003 WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0004 HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
8095-274348-0005 ENTIRELY DISPOSED TO GAYETY AND GALLANTRY THE CARDINAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT STRONGLY INCLINED HIM TO COUNTERWORK THE AMOROUS PROJECTS OF HIS RIVAL WHEN THE DUKE WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR A NEW EMBASSY TO PARIS
8095-274348-0006 A MESSAGE WAS SENT HIM FROM LOUIS THAT HE MUST NOT THINK OF SUCH A JOURNEY IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0007 AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
8095-274348-0008 CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
8095-274348-0009 AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
8095-274348-0010 AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
8095-274348-0011 THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
8095-274348-0012 AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
8095-274348-0013 THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
8095-274348-0014 IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0015 AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
8095-274348-0016 SHUT THEIR GATES AND REFUSED TO ADMIT ALLIES OF WHOSE COMING THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFORMED
8095-274348-0017 HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
8095-274346-0000 CHARLES GAVE THEM A GRACIOUS AND A COMPLIANT ANSWER TO ALL THEIR REMONSTRANCES HE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS HEART EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THESE FURIOUS MEASURES
8095-274346-0001 THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
8095-274346-0002 AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
8095-274346-0003 BUT SO UNFORTUNATE WAS THIS PRINCE THAT NO MEASURE EMBRACED DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN WAS EVER ATTENDED WITH MORE UNHAPPY AND MORE FATAL CONSEQUENCES
8095-274346-0004 THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
8095-274346-0005 THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0006 AND WHICH THEY SANCTIFIED BY THE MOST MELANCHOLY INDOLENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THE DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS OF THIS FESTIVAL WERE AT THAT TIME KNOWN SYMBOLS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES
8095-274346-0007 THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY
8095-274346-0008 WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
8095-274346-0009 THE ARMY WAS LANDED AND A FORT TAKEN BUT THE UNDISCIPLINED SOLDIERS FINDING STORE OF WINE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM THE UTMOST EXCESSES FURTHER STAY APPEARING FRUITLESS THEY WERE REEMBARKED AND THE FLEET PUT TO SEA
8095-274346-0010 WITH AN INTENTION OF INTERCEPTING THE SPANISH GALLEONS BUT THE PLAGUE HAVING SEIZED THE SEAMEN AND SOLDIERS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF THIS PRIZE AND RETURN TO ENGLAND LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE COURT FOR INTRUSTING SO IMPORTANT A COMMAND
8095-274346-0011 WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0012 RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
8095-274346-0013 WAS MUCH TRUSTED TO HE HAD NAMED FOUR POPULAR LEADERS SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES SIR EDWARD COKE SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH AND SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR AND THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN FORMERLY MUCH CONTESTED
8095-274346-0014 HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
8095-274346-0015 ENOW OF PATRIOTS STILL REMAINED TO KEEP UP THE ILL HUMOR OF THE HOUSE AND MEN NEEDED BUT LITTLE INSTRUCTION OR RHETORIC TO RECOMMEND TO THEM PRACTICES
8095-274346-0016 THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
8095-274346-0017 THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
8095-274346-0018 UNDER COLOR OF REDRESSING GRIEVANCES WHICH DURING THIS SHORT REIGN COULD NOT BE VERY NUMEROUS THEY WERE TO PROCEED IN REGULATING AND CONTROLLING EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DISPLEASED THEM
8095-274346-0019 AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0020 BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
8095-274346-0021 HAD EXPRESSED ALL DUTY AND OBEDIENCE IN EXPECTATION THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD OFFER OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN HIS FORMER CREDIT AND AUTHORITY EVEN AFTER CHARLES'S ACCESSION HE DESPAIRED NOT
8095-274346-0022 HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
8095-274346-0023 BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0024 AND TO THESE HE WAS DETERMINED FOR THE FUTURE TO TRUST FOR HIS SECURITY AND PROTECTION WHEN THE PARLIAMENT WAS SUMMONED CHARLES BY A STRETCH OF PREROGATIVE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO WRIT AS IS CUSTOMARY SHOULD BE SENT TO BRISTOL
8095-274346-0025 THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
8095-274346-0026 COMMANDING HIM IN THE KING'S NAME TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT THIS LETTER BRISTOL CONVEYED TO THE LORDS AND ASKED ADVICE HOW TO PROCEED IN SO DELICATE A SITUATION
8095-274346-0027 THE KING'S PROHIBITION WAS WITHDRAWN AND BRISTOL TOOK HIS SEAT PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
8095-274346-0028 BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION BRISTOL ACCUSED BUCKINGHAM OF HIGH TREASON BOTH THE EARL'S DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AND ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE REMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS STILL EXTANT
8095-274346-0029 OF DELIVERING SHIPS TO THE FRENCH KING IN ORDER TO SERVE AGAINST THE HUGONOTS OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
8095-274346-0030 AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH
8095-274346-0031 THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
8095-274346-0032 SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
8095-274346-0033 BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
8095-274346-0034 A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
8095-274346-0035 THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
8095-274346-0036 THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER HITHERTO AFFORDED ONE INSTANCE WHERE ANY GREAT MOVEMENT OR REVOLUTION HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER HOUSE AND AS THEIR RANK BOTH CONSIDERED IN A BODY AND AS INDIVIDUALS WAS BUT THE SECOND IN THE KINGDOM
8095-274346-0037 NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
8095-274346-0038 BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
8095-274346-0039 YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
8095-274346-0040 IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0041 THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
8095-274346-0042 WHICH BRINGETH SUCH HAPPINESS TO THIS NATION AND MAKES US ENVIED OF ALL OTHERS WHILE THERE IS THIS SWEETNESS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COMMONS LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT
8095-274346-0043 THESE IMPRUDENT SUGGESTIONS RATHER GAVE WARNING THAN STRUCK TERROR A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THE COMMONS THOUGHT WHICH WAS TO BE PRESERVED BY UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LIBERTY AT ALL AND IT WAS NECESSARY WHILE YET IN THEIR POWER
8095-274346-0044 TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8095-274346-0045 THE COMMONS IMMEDIATELY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED NO FURTHER UPON BUSINESS TILL THEY HAD SATISFACTION IN THEIR PRIVILEGES CHARLES ALLEGED AS THE REASON OF THIS MEASURE CERTAIN SEDITIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD IN THEIR ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE
8095-274346-0046 DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
8095-274346-0047 AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274346-0048 AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING
8095-274346-0049 HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC HIS WIFE WAS NOT FREE FROM SUSPICION
8095-274346-0050 SO VIOLENT WAS THE BIGOTRY OF THE TIMES THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR DISQUALIFYING ANY ONE FROM HOLDING AN OFFICE
8095-274346-0051 THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
8095-274346-0052 WHILE THEY RETAINED SUCH A PLEDGE BESIDES THE SUPPLY ALREADY PROMISED THEY WERE SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE REFUSED THEM THOUGH AFTER CANVASSING THE MATTER NEAR THREE NINTHS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF FIXING ANY LEGAL CRIME UPON THE DUKE
8095-274346-0053 THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0054 WERE HE CAPABLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN TO GIVE IN SO SIGNAL AN INSTANCE SUCH MATTER OF TRIUMPH TO HIS ENEMIES AND DISCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ADHERENTS TO DAY THE COMMONS PRETEND TO WREST HIS MINISTER FROM HIM
8095-274346-0055 TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
8095-274346-0056 WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
8095-274346-0057 OF WHICH THEY INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO SUCH DEEP PERFIDY TO SUCH UNBOUNDED USURPATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPPOSE A PROPER FIRMNESS AND RESOLUTION
7402-90848-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS AN OLD WIDOW WOMAN WHO HAD THREE SONS THE FIRST TWO WERE CLEVER ENOUGH BUT THE THIRD BOBO BY NAME WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A SILLY SIMPLETON ALL HIS MOTHER'S SCOLDINGS AND BEATINGS
7402-90848-0001 AND SHE SMACKED THE POOR LAD SOUNDLY A DOZEN TIMES A DAY DID HIM NO GOOD WHATEVER NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT ONE MORNING PRINCESS ZENZA THE RULER OF THE LAND HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE COTTAGE AND HEARD BOBO BEING GIVEN A TERRIBLE TONGUE LASHING
7402-90848-0002 CURIOUS AS TO THE CAUSE OF ALL THE NOISE THE PRINCESS DREW REIN AND SUMMONED BOBO'S MOTHER TO COME NEAR ON HEARING HER STORY IT OCCURRED TO THE PRINCESS THAT SO SILLY A LAD MIGHT AMUSE HER
7402-90848-0003 NOW HE WOULD BE SENT TO FIND A WHITE CRAW'S FEATHER OR A SPRAY OF YELLOW BLUEBELLS NOW HE WAS ORDERED TO LOOK FOR A SQUARE WHEEL OR A GLASS OF DRY WATER EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM AND MADE FUN OF HIM THAT IS
7402-90848-0004 EVERYBODY EXCEPT LITTLE TILDA THE KITCHEN MAID WHEN POOR BOBO USED TO RETURN FROM SOME WILD GOOSE CHASE TIRED OUT MUD STAINED AND OFTEN ENOUGH WET TO THE SKIN
7402-90848-0005 INSTEAD OF LAUGHING LITTLE TILDA WOULD FIND HIM A GLASS OF WARM MILK HANG HIS COAT BY THE FIRE TO DRY AND TELL HIM NOT TO BE SUCH A SIMPLETON AGAIN THUS AFTER A WHILE
7402-90848-0006 ONE PLEASANT MID SUMMER MORNING WHEN BOBO HAD BEEN NEARLY A YEAR AT THE CASTLE PRINCESS ZENZA OVERSLEPT HALF AN HOUR AND DID NOT COME DOWN TO BREAKFAST AT THE USUAL TIME WHEN SHE DID GET UP SHE FOUND HER COURT WAITING FOR HER IN THE CASTLE GARDENS
7402-90848-0007 SHALL WE SEND BOBO IN SEARCH OF THE LOST HALF HOUR SAID THE PRINCESS TO THE COURTIERS YES YES CRIED THE COURTIERS BOBO SHALL LOOK FOR THE LOST HALF HOUR I'LL GIVE HIM A HORSE SAID ONE
7402-90848-0008 WHEN HE RETURNED THE GOOD KITCHEN MAID SAID LITTLE FOR SHE FEARED LEST SOME MISADVENTURE OVERTAKE THE POOR SIMPLETON BUT WHEN THE CHIEF COOK WAS NOT LOOKING SHE TUCKED A FRESH CURRANT BUN INTO BOBO'S POCKET
7402-90848-0009 GOOD BYE BOBO CRIED THE ASSEMBLED COURTIERS WHO WERE ALMOST BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH LAUGHTER AT THE SIMPLETON AND HIS ERRAND DON'T FAIL TO BRING BACK THE LOST HALF HOUR SO BOBO RODE OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY
7402-90848-0010 IT WAS VERY DIGNIFIED AND WORE TORTOISE SHELL GLASSES BUT BOBO HAD TO ANSWER NO AND THE OLD MAN WANDERED ON AGAIN ANOTHER DAY THE SIMPLETON ENCOUNTERED A TALL DARK FIERCE KIND OF FELLOW
7402-90848-0011 WHO ANSWERED HIS POLITE QUESTION WITH A SCREAM OF RAGE A HALF HOUR HE ROARED NO I HAVE N'T SEEN YOUR HALF HOUR I WOULD N'T TELL YOU IF I HAD WHAT'S MORE I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT
7402-90848-0012 I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING I'VE LOST MYSELF I'VE LOST MY TEMPER
7402-90848-0013 ANSWER ME YOU SILLY HAVE YOU SEEN A LOST TEMPER ANYWHERE IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE MELON AND HAS SHARP LITTLE POINTS ON BOBO'S ANSWERING NO THIS DREADFUL PERSON UTTERED SO PERFECTLY AWFUL A SCREECH OF RAGE
7402-90848-0014 THAT BOBO'S HORSE TOOK FRIGHT AND RAN AWAY WITH HIM AND IT WAS ALL THAT BOBO COULD DO TO REIN HIM IN THREE MILES FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD STILL FARTHER ALONG BOBO CAME TO ZIZZ THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE KINGDOM OF THE SEVEN BROOKS AND WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE KING HIMSELF
7402-90848-0015 HERE THE POOR OLD KING TOOK OUT A GREAT GREEN HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS EYES SHE WAS STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES ON MIDSUMMER EVE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO FIND HER WORTHY BOBO AND AN IMMENSE REWARD WILL BE YOURS
7402-90848-0016 AND HE CONTINUED HIS WAY ON FOOT THREE LONG YEARS PASSED AND BOBO GREW INTO A HANDSOME LAD BUT REMAINED A SIMPLETON STILL FINALLY AFTER HE HAD WANDERED ALL ABOUT FAIRYLAND HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE SEA
7402-90848-0017 BOBO ASKED THE SAILORS IF THEY HAD SEEN A LOST HALF HOUR NO SAID THE SAILORS BUT WE ARE GOING TO THE ISLES OF IRON SUPPOSE YOU GO WITH US THE LOST HALF HOUR MAY BE THERE
7402-90848-0018 SO BOBO WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND SAILED OUT UPON THE DARK SEA FOR TWO DAYS THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND CLEAR BUT ON THE THIRD DAY THERE CAME A DREADFUL STORM AND ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE VESSEL WAS DRIVEN FAR OFF HER COURSE INTO THE UNKNOWN OCEAN
7402-90848-0019 AND WAS WRECKED UPON A MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF ROCKS THAT SHONE IN THE NIGHT LIKE WET MATCHES A GREAT WAVE SWEPT THE DECKS AND BOBO WAS BORNE AWAY FROM HIS COMPANIONS AND CARRIED TOWARD THE SHINING LAND
7402-90848-0020 THOUGH POUNDED AND BATTERED BY THE FOAMING WAVES THE SIMPLETON AT LENGTH MANAGED TO REACH THE BEACH AND TOOK REFUGE IN A CREVICE OF THE CLIFF DURING THE STORMY NIGHT WHEN THE DAWN BROKE ALL SIGN OF THE SHIP HAD DISAPPEARED
7402-90848-0021 LOOKING ABOUT BOBO FOUND HIMSELF ON A LOVELY ISLAND WHOSE HEART WAS A HIGH MOUNTAIN MASS HIDDEN IN THE FOG STILL SWEEPING IN FROM THE SEA THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE A ROAD OR A PATH TO BE SEEN
7402-90848-0022 IN WHICH WERE A PAIR OF WOODEN SHOES ABOVE THE SHOES WAS A CARD SAYING SIMPLY
7402-90848-0023 SO BOBO SAT DOWN ON A STONE BY THE FOOT OF THE TREE AND PUT ON THE WOODEN SHOES WHICH FITTED HIM VERY NICELY NOW THESE SHOES WERE MAGIC SHOES AND BOBO HAD HARDLY STEPPED INTO THEM BEFORE THEY TURNED HIS FEET INLAND
7402-90848-0024 SO BOBO OBEDIENTLY LET THE SHOES GUIDE HIM AT CORNERS THE SHOES ALWAYS TURNED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IF BOBO FORGOT AND BLUNDERED ON THE WRONG WAY THE SHOES SWIFTLY BEGAN TO PINCH HIS TOES
7402-90848-0025 FOR TWO DAYS BOBO WALKED INLAND TOWARD THE GREAT MOUNTAIN A WARM WIND BLEW THE CLOUDS AND RAIN AWAY THE SUN SHONE SWEET AND CLEAR ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY THE SIMPLETON ENTERED A WOOD OF TALL SILENT TREES
7402-90848-0026 AND AS THAT DAY WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE TURRETS OF A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE ROSE FAR AWAY OVER THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST BOBO ARRIVED AT TWILIGHT
7402-90848-0027 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN LYING BETWEEN THE CASTLE WALLS AND THE RISING SLOPES OF A GREAT MOUNTAIN STRANGE TO SAY NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN AND THOUGH THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE CASTLE
7402-90848-0028 THERE WAS NOT EVEN A WARDER AT THE GATE SUDDENLY A GREAT BOOMING BELL STRUCK SEVEN O'CLOCK BOBO BEGAN TO HEAR VOICES AND SOUNDS AND THEN BEFORE THE HUMMING OF THE BELL HAD DIED AWAY
7402-90848-0029 A YOUTH MOUNTED ON A SPLENDID BLACK HORSE DASHED AT LIGHTNING SPEED OUT OF THE CASTLE AND DISAPPEARED IN THE WOOD AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD ACCOMPANIED BY ELEVEN YOUNG MEN WHOM BOBO JUDGED FROM THEIR EXPRESSIONS TO BE BROTHERS
7402-90848-0030 STOOD BY THE GATE TO SEE THE HORSEMAN RIDE AWAY PLUCKING UP COURAGE BOBO CAME FORWARD FELL ON HIS KNEE BEFORE THE OLD MAN AND TOLD HIS STORY TRULY YOU SHOULD THANK THE STORM FAIRIES SAID THE OLD MAN
7402-90848-0031 FOR HAD YOU NOT BEEN WRECKED UPON THIS ISLAND NEVER WOULD YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE LOST HALF HOUR I AM FATHER TIME HIMSELF AND THESE ARE MY TWELVE SONS THE HOURS EVERY DAY ONE AFTER THE OTHER
7402-90848-0032 THEY RIDE FOR AN HOUR ROUND THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD SEVEN O'CLOCK HAS JUST RIDDEN FORTH YES YOU SHALL HAVE THE LOST HALF HOUR BUT YOU MUST LOOK AFTER MY SONS HORSES FOR THE SPACE OF A WHOLE YEAR TO THIS
7402-90848-0033 BOBO WILLINGLY AGREED SO TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE HOURS TOOK HIM TO THE STABLES AND SHOWED HIM THE LITTLE ROOM IN THE TURRET THAT HE WAS TO HAVE
7402-90848-0034 HE TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF THE GREAT BLACK HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND THE WHITE HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE DAY THAT THEY WERE NEVER MORE PROUD AND STRONG NOR THEIR COATS SMOOTHER AND MORE GLEAMING WHEN THE YEAR WAS UP BOBO AGAIN SOUGHT OUT FATHER TIME
7402-90848-0035 YOU HAVE SERVED FAITHFULLY AND WELL SAID FATHER TIME HERE IS YOUR REWARD AND WITH THESE WORDS HE PLACED IN BOBO'S HANDS A SMALL SQUARE CASKET MADE OF EBONY THE HALF HOUR LIES INSIDE
7402-90848-0036 DON'T TRY TO PEEK AT IT OR OPEN THE BOX UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME HAS COME IF YOU DO THE HALF HOUR WILL FLYAWAY AND DISAPPEAR FOREVER FAREWELL BOBO SAID KIND YOUNG TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO HAD BEEN THE SIMPLETON'S GOOD FRIEND
7402-90848-0037 I TOO HAVE A GIFT FOR THEE DRINK THIS CUP OF WATER TO THE LAST DROP AND THE YOUTH HANDED THE SIMPLETON A SILVER CUP FULL TO THE BRIM OF CLEAR SHINING WATER NOW THIS WATER WAS THE WATER OF WISDOM
7402-90848-0038 AND WHEN BOBO HAD DRUNK IT HE WAS NO LONGER A SIMPLETON AND BEING NO LONGER A SIMPLETON HE REMEMBERED THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS REPUTATION THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS TEMPER AND THE KING WHOSE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES
7402-90848-0039 TELL THE FIRST SAID FATHER TIME THAT HIS REPUTATION HAS BEEN BROKEN INTO A THOUSAND PIECES WHICH HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY HIS NEIGHBORS AND CARRIED HOME IF HE CAN PERSUADE HIS NEIGHBORS TO GIVE THEM UP
7402-90848-0040 AS FOR THE MISSING DAUGHTER SHE IS THE KITCHEN MAID IN PRINCESS ZENZA'S PALACE WHO IS KNOWN AS TILDA SO BOBO THANKED FATHER TIME AND AT NOON
7402-90848-0041 TWELVE O'CLOCK PLACED HIM BEHIND HIM ON THE WHITE CHARGER AND HURRIED AWAY SO FAST THEY FLEW THAT BOBO WHO WAS HOLDING THE EBONY CASKET CLOSE AGAINST HIS HEART WAS IN GREAT DANGER OF FALLING OFF
7402-90848-0042 WHEN THEY GOT TO THE SEASHORE THE WHITE HORSE HESITATED NOT AN INSTANT BUT SET FOOT UPON THE WATER WHICH BORE HIM UP AS IF IT HAD BEEN NOT WATER BUT EARTH ITSELF
7402-90848-0043 BOBO WITH GREAT GOODNESS OF HEART TOOK ALONG THIS EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING ITS ANGRY POSSESSOR FARTHER ON THE LAD ENCOUNTERED TILDA'S FATHER THE UNHAPPY KING AND DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7402-90848-0044 THE JOY OF THE MONARCH KNEW NO BOUNDS AND BOBO THE ONE TIME SIMPLETON BECAME ON THE SPOT LORD BOBO OF THE SAPPHIRE HILLS MARQUIS OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON PRINCE OF THE VALLEY OF GOLDEN APPLES
7402-90848-0045 IN A WORD THE GREATEST NOBLEMAN IN ALL FAIRYLAND
7402-90848-0046 ALL IN SPLENDID SILKS AND SOLDIERS IN SHINING ARMOR THE DELIGHTED KING RODE OFF TO CLAIM HIS MISSING DAUGHTER FROM PRINCESS ZENZA SO ON THEY RODE THE HARNESSES JINGLING THE BRIDLE BELLS RINGING
7402-90848-0047 AND THE BREASTPLATES OF THE ARMED MEN SHINING IN THE SUN AFTER A WEEK OF ALMOST CONSTANT PROGRESS FOR THE KING WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER THAT HE WOULD HARDLY GIVE THE CAVALCADE TIME TO REST
7402-90848-0048 ON THE STEPS OF ONE OF THE COTTAGES SAT AN OLD WOMAN ALL ALONE AND WEEPING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WHAT IS THE MATTER MY GOOD WOMAN SAID THE KING
7402-90848-0049 EVIL DAYS HAVE FALLEN UPON OUR UNHAPPY KINGDOM THREE DAYS AGO A TERRIBLE DRAGON ALIGHTED IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE AND SENT WORD TO PRINCESS ZENZA THAT IF WITHIN THREE DAYS SHE DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH SOMEONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO HOME WITH HIM AND COOK HIS MEALS
7402-90848-0050 AND KEEP HIS CAVERN TIDY HE WOULD BURN OUR FIELDS WITH HIS FIERY BREATH YET WHO I ASK YOU WOULD BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR A DRAGON
7402-90848-0051 THAT WE ARE MOURNING AT TWO O'CLOCK SHE IS TO BE CARRIED OFF BY THE DRAGON IT IS ALMOST TWO NOW ALAS ALAS HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF HER MOUTH WHEN THE TOWN BELL STRUCK TWICE SOLEMNLY AND SADLY
7402-90848-0052 QUICK QUICK CRIED THE KING AND BOBO IN THE SAME BREATH LET US HURRY TO THE CASTLE WE MAY SAVE HER YET BUT THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY WERE TOO LATE AND THAT POOR TILDA HAD GIVEN HERSELF TO THE DRAGON
7402-90848-0053 AND SO IT PROVED IN SPITE OF HIS MAD DASH BOBO WHO HAD SPURRED ON AHEAD ARRIVED EXACTLY HALF AN HOUR LATE THE MONSTROUS DRAGON WITH TILDA IN HIS CLAWS
7402-90848-0054 THINGS SHOULD BE EXACTLY AS THEY WERE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE OPENED THE COVER OF THE EBONY BOX SOMETHING LIKE A WINGED WHITE FLAME ESCAPED FROM IT AND FLEW HISSING THROUGH THE AIR TO THE SUN
7402-90848-0055 AS FOR THE SUN ITSELF TURNING ROUND LIKE A CARTWHEEL AND HISSING LIKE TEN THOUSAND ROCKETS IT ROLLED BACK ALONG THE SKY TO THE EAST THE HANDS OF THE CLOCKS WHICH MARKED HALF PAST TWO WHIRRED BACK TO TWO O'CLOCK IN A TWINKLING
7402-90848-0056 AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS BRAVE LITTLE TILDA STANDING ALONE IN A GREAT FIELD WAITING FOR THE DRAGON TO COME AND TAKE HER AWAY LUMBERING HEAVILY ALONG LIKE A MONSTROUS TURTLE AND SNORTING BLUE SMOKE
7402-90848-0057 THE DRAGON WAS ADVANCING TOWARD HER BOBO RAN DOWN INTO THE FIELD AND STOOD BESIDE TILDA READY TO DEFEND HER TO THE END THE DRAGON CAME NEARER AND NEARER SUDDENLY
7402-90848-0058 ANGERED BY THE SIGHT OF BOBO AND HIS DRAWN SWORD HE ROARED ANGRILY BUT CONTINUED TO APPROACH BOBO STRUCK AT HIM WITH HIS SWORD THE BLADE BROKE UPON HIS STEELY SCALES THE DRAGON ROARED AGAIN NOW
7402-90848-0059 JUST AS THE DRAGON'S MOUTH WAS ITS WIDEST BOBO WHO HAD BEEN SEARCHING HIS POCKETS DESPERATELY HURLED INTO IT THE LOST TEMPER THERE WAS A PERFECTLY TERRIFIC BANG AS IF A MILLION BALLOONS HAD BLOWN UP ALL AT ONCE
7402-90848-0060 FOR THE DRAGON HAD BLOWN UP THE LOST TEMPER HAD FINISHED HIM ONLY ONE FRAGMENT OF HIM A TINY BIT OF A CLAW WAS EVER FOUND
7402-90848-0061 THE GRAND CROSS OF THE ORDER OF THE BLACK CAT WAS CONFERRED UPON BOBO BY PRINCESS ZENZA WHO ALSO ASKED HIS PARDON FOR HAVING TREATED HIM SO SHABBILY THIS BOBO GAVE READILY
7402-90848-0062 WHEN THE REJOICINGS WERE OVER
1263-139804-0000 SUSTAINS THE SHORTEST LIVED HUMAN BEINGS OF OUR UNIVERSE IT IS SELDOM THAT ANY OF THE CREATURES REACH MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OF AGE ACCORDING TO OUR STANDARDS OF TIME
1263-139804-0001 THEY ARE NEARLY AS LARGE AS WE AND RELATIVELY MUCH LIGHTER IN WEIGHT ALL THE PERIODS OF PHYSICAL GROWTH ARE CORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED CHILDREN WALK FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS AFTER BIRTH
1263-139804-0002 AND ARE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING REGULAR INSTRUCTION AT THE AGE OF FIVE MONTHS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THIS SPHERE WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE WE WILL CALL BRIEF
1263-139804-0003 REVOLVES VERY SLOWLY ON ITS AXIS SO THAT OUR WORLD MAKES FIFTEEN TIMES AS MANY REVOLUTIONS AS THIS PLANET IT REQUIRES BUT LITTLE ARITHMETIC TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF DO NOT SEE THE SUN RISE VERY OFTEN
1263-139804-0004 ON THIS WORLD OF BRIEF ALL VEGETABLES MATURE IN PERIODS SO SHORT THAT ONE MARVELS WHEN HE HEARS IT THINK OF CEREALS REACHING MATURITY IN SEVEN OR EIGHT OF OUR DAYS OR DURING ONE DAY OF BRIEF
1263-139804-0005 EARLY IN THE MORNING CERTAIN CROPS ARE PLANTED AND ARE HARVESTED AT NIGHT TWO OR MORE DAYS ARE REQUIRED FOR MATURING OTHER CROPS ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF RAISE THEIR CROPS WITH LESS LABOR THAN IS REQUIRED AMONGST US
1263-139804-0006 IF YOU WERE PERMITTED TO LOOK UPON THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE OF THIS INCREDIBLE WORLD YOUR FIRST SENSATION WOULD BE DIZZINESS NOT TO MENTION THE WEIRDNESS OF ALL SIGHTS THAT WOULD CONFRONT YOU AT EVERY TURN
1263-139804-0007 AND IF BY LEASE OF STRENGTH THEY PASS ON TOWARD AN AGE OF FOUR YEARS IT IS BUT AN EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXCEPTIONAL VITALITY IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE THAT THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG LIFE OF SIXTY OR EIGHTY YEARS IS CROWDED INTO A NARROW COMPASS OF FOUR YEARS
1263-139804-0008 THERE BEING NO COMPETITION NO TIME OR SPACE IS REQUIRED FOR SENSATIONAL TRASH THUS IF NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURS NOTHING NEED BE TRANSMITTED THE OFFICIAL NEWS CENSORS DECIDE AS TO THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF OCCURRENCES
1263-139804-0009 THERE NEED NOT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NEWS TELEGRAPHED EACH HOUR THE GOVERNMENT VERIFIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL REPORTS BEFORE THEY ARE TRANSMITTED THERE ARE INDEED SOME ADVANTAGES IN THE GOVERNMENT BEING IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH EACH HOME UNDER ITS CARE
1263-139804-0010 THE ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT PAYS NEARLY ALL EXPENSES OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF JOURNALISM ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR PRIVATE GAIN ARE PAID AT A REGULAR RATE IT COSTS MORE TO ADVERTISE AT CERTAIN PERIODS THAN AT OTHER TIMES
1263-139804-0011 THEY NEVER THINK OF COVERING THE FEET UNDER ANY CHANGE OF CLIMATE IF ONE OF THE BRIEFITES WERE TO STEP UPON THE SHORES OF OUR RUGGED EARTH AND SEE THE COTTON OR WOOL AND LEATHER THAT LIES AROUND OUR FEET IT WOULD APPEAR TO HIM AS THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IMAGINABLE
1263-139804-0012 NEITHER THE MEN WOMEN NOR CHILDREN SEEM TO SEEK THIS MEANS FOR SELF BEAUTIFYING THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT BEAUTY OF CHARACTER HAS A RADIANCE MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THE FLASH OF OPALS OR THE LUSTER OF SILKS THEIR GARMENTS PARTAKE OF THE LOOSE FLOWING ORDER
1263-139804-0013 FOR INSTANCE A STRONG FABRIC OF CHOSEN SHADE IS FASTENED AT THE NECK HIP KNEE AND ANKLE AND LIES CARELESSLY OVER THE PARTS BETWEEN THE FEMALES NEVER GRADUATED TO THE CORSET DEGREE AND WHILE THEY DO NOT CUT A SCIENTIFIC FIGURE
1263-139804-0014 TRANSPORTATION THE METHODS OF TRAVELING ARE SO CONTRARY TO OUR CONCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES THAT I ALMOST FORBEAR TO ATTEMPT ANY DESCRIPTION
1263-139804-0015 WHEN AN EXCHANGE OF SEATS IS NECESSARY IT IS ALL DONE SO EASILY AND SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD WONDER WHY WE TOLERATE TROLLEY CARS IN TRAVELING FROM CITY TO CITY A SYSTEM IS IN USE THAT I WILL CALL THE TOBOGGAN SLIDE SYSTEM
1263-139804-0016 ALTHOUGH THE CARS RUN ON WHEELS THE CAR IS RAISED IN A SHAFT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET AND THEN BY GRAVITY IT DASHES TWO OR MORE MILES ACCORDING TO THE LAY OF THE LAND TRAVERSED THEN ANOTHER RISE MORE OR LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET IS EXPERIENCED
1263-139804-0017 AND THEN ANOTHER WILD DASH I HAVE NO WORDS OF PRAISE FOR THIS SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THE BRIEFITES CAN COVER CONSIDERABLE TERRITORY IN AN HOUR THEY LOOK UPON THIS GRAVITY SYSTEM AS A WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENT FOR IT HAS NOT BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1263-139804-0018 THE POWER OF STEAM HAS NEVER BEEN UTILIZED NO GENIUS OF ALL THIS ACTIVE WORLD OF BRIEF EVER CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT ALMOST UNLIMITED POWER LIES WRAPPED UP IN THIN VAPORY WATER BUT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT WE WOULD CALL GASEOUS OIL
1263-139804-0019 AND HAVE LEARNED TO PUT IT TO WORK SO THAT IT IS THE MAIN FORCE EMPLOYED IN HOISTING AND ALL OTHER PURPOSES WHERE POWER IS REQUIRED NOTHING LIKE A TRAVELING LOCOMOTIVE HAS EVER BEEN MADE ALTHOUGH I LEARNED THAT A BRIGHT WIZARD WAS EXPERIMENTING
1263-139804-0020 AND THAT HE PROPHESIED GREAT CHANGES WHEN HIS GAS PROPELLED VEHICLE WAS PERFECTED THINK OF HOW MUCH VALUE AN ORDINARY CITIZEN OF OUR WORLD WOULD BE TO THESE BRIEFITES IF HE COULD STEP UPON THEIR WORLD AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEM CONCERNING THE MAGIC WONDERS OF STEAM
1263-139804-0021 AND THE MANNER OF CONSTRUCTING STATIONARY AND MOVABLE ENGINES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE HIDDEN WONDERS OF ELECTRICITY QUADRUPEDS THAT TAKE THE PLACE OF OUR HORSES ARE USED FOR DRAYAGE ALTHOUGH NOTHING EXCEPT THE TWO WHEELED CLASS OF VEHICLES WAS EVER USED UNTIL SOME EIGHTY SEVEN YEARS AGO
1263-139804-0022 PUBLIC HIGHWAYS THESE INTERESTING PEOPLE EXCEL US IN THEIR STYLE AND MANNER OF HOME BUILDING FENCING AND MAKING PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE ARE HEATHENISH IN OUR PROGRESS ALONG THE LINE OF ROAD MAKING ESPECIALLY
1263-139804-0023 IN ALL MY VAST JOURNEY AMONG THE WORLDS I FOUND ONLY A FEW COMPARATIVELY WHEREON THE ROADS WERE INFERIOR TO OURS IN THE WORLD OF BRIEF THE STATE PRESCRIBES THE MANNER OF PUBLIC HIGHWAYS AND EACH CITIZEN MUST CONTRIBUTE HIS SHARE TO THEIR CREATION AND MAINTENANCE
1263-139804-0024 VERY INTRICATE AND ELABORATE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BY THESE PEOPLE OF A FEW YEARS THEY ARE INFERIOR TO US IN A HUNDRED WAYS IN THE BROAD FIELDS OF MANUFACTURE AND INVENTION THEY LAG A LONG DISTANCE IN THE REAR THIS IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THEIR LACK OF TIME
1263-139804-0025 RELIGIOUS LIFE THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF IS ON AN AVERAGE OF A HIGHER TYPE THAN IS FOUND IN OUR WORLD THEIR BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY HAS RUN PARALLEL WITH THEIR EXISTENCE AS A PEOPLE
1263-139804-0026 THE MOST FAITHFUL TRANSLATION OF THIS WORD INTO OUR LANGUAGE WOULD BE GOD AFFLUENCE KERM CHER OR GOD BREATH APPEARED UPON BRIEF FULL GROWN
1263-139804-0027 SIMILAR TO CHRIST HE CONFIRMED HIS IDENTITY BY UNANSWERABLE MIRACLES MANY HOWEVER DISBELIEVED IN KERM CHER AND HELD TO THE OLD AXIOMATIC TRUTHS THUS CREEDS WERE PREVALENT AND THEY REMAIN UNTIL NOW
1263-139804-0028 ONLY THERE IS MUCH LESS VARIETY THAN IS FOUND AMONGST US KERM CHER SET UP A NEW REIGN AND ACCEPTED A TEMPORAL THRONE FOR A SEASON HE FINALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HIS AMBASSADORSHIP WOULD SOON CEASE
1263-139804-0029 AND THAT HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD LOSE THE THRONE OF CIVIL POWER THAT THEY WOULD BE TESTED FOR A SEASON IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AND BY THE FIRES OF TERRIBLE PERSECUTION AND THAT THEY WHO WOULD ENDURE UNTO THE END WOULD BE GLORIFIED
1263-141777-0000 MOISTURE FROM THE NIGHT'S RAIN HUNG ON THE TREE LEAVES CLUNG IN GLOBULES TO RYNCH'S SWEATING BODY HE LAY ON A WIDE BRANCH TRYING TO CONTROL THE HEAVY PANTING WHICH SUPPLIED HIS LABORING LUNGS
1263-141777-0001 AND HE COULD STILL HEAR THE ECHOES OF THE STARTLED CRIES WHICH HAD COME FROM THE MEN WHO HAD THREADED THROUGH THE WOODS TO THE UP POINTED TAIL FINS OF THE L B NOW HE TRIED TO REASON WHY HE HAD RUN THEY WERE HIS OWN KIND
1263-141777-0002 THEY WOULD TAKE HIM OUT OF THE LONELINESS OF A WORLD HERETOFORE EMPTY OF HIS SPECIES BUT THAT TALL MAN THE ONE WHO HAD LED THE PARTY INTO THE IRREGULAR CLEARING ABOUT THE LIFE BOAT RYNCH SHIVERED
1263-141777-0003 DUG HIS NAILS INTO THE WOOD ON WHICH HE LAY AT THE SIGHT OF THAT MAN DREAM AND REALITY HAD CRASHED TOGETHER SENDING HIM INTO PANIC STRICKEN FLIGHT THAT WAS THE MAN FROM THE ROOM
1263-141777-0004 THE MAN WITH THE CUP AS HIS HEART QUIETED HE BEGAN TO THINK MORE COHERENTLY FIRST HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE STRONG JAWS'S DEN
1263-141777-0005 THEN THE MARKS ON THE GROUND AT THE POINT FROM WHICH HE HAD FALLEN AND THE L B WERE HERE JUST AS HE REMEMBERED BUT NOT FAR FROM THE SMALL SHIP HE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE A CAMPSITE WITH A SHELTER FASHIONED OUT OF SPALLS AND VINES
1263-141777-0006 TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP CLEARING WAS TO RISK CAPTURE BUT HE HAD TO KNOW RYNCH LOOKED WITH MORE ATTENTION AT HIS PRESENT SURROUNDINGS DEEP MOLD UNDER THE TREES HERE WOULD HOLD TRACKS THERE MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE
1263-141777-0007 THOUGH IT WAS BALLED IN UPON ITSELF HE WAS SURE THE CREATURE WAS FULLY AS LARGE AS HE AND THE MENACING CLAWS SUGGESTED IT WAS A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WHEN IT MADE NO MOVE TO FOLLOW HIM
1263-141777-0008 RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
1263-141777-0009 NONE CAME AND HE DARED TO SLIP AROUND THE BOLE OF THE TREE UNDER WHICH HE STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY FOR ANY CORRESPONDING MOVEMENT OVERHEAD NOW HE WAS FACING THAT SURVIVOR'S CAMP
1263-141777-0010 ANOTHER OBJECT CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF THE LEAN TO SHELTER JUST AS ITS FELLOW WAS ON SENTRY DUTY IN THE TREE ONLY THIS ONE DID NOT HAVE THE SELF COLOR OF THE FOLIAGE TO DISGUISE IT FOUR LIMBED ITS LONG FOREARMS CURVED ABOUT ITS BENT KNEES
1263-141777-0011 AND THE SENSE ORGANS OF EYES AND NOSE SQUEEZED TOGETHER ON THE LOWER QUARTER OF THE ROUNDED PORTION WITH A LINE OF WIDE MOUTH TO SPLIT THE BLUNT ROUND OF THE MUZZLE DARK PITS FOR EYES SHOWED NO PUPIL IRIS OR CORNEA
1263-141777-0012 THE NOSE WAS A BLACK PERFECTLY ROUNDED TUBE JUTTING AN INCH OR SO BEYOND THE CHEEK SURFACE GROTESQUE ALIEN AND TERRIFYING IT MADE NO HOSTILE MOVE AND SINCE IT HAD NOT TURNED ITS HEAD HE COULD NOT BE SURE IT HAD EVEN SIGHTED HIM
1263-141777-0013 BUT IT KNEW HE WAS THERE HE WAS CERTAIN OF THAT AND WAS WAITING FOR WHAT AS THE LONG SECONDS CRAWLED BY RYNCH BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT WAITING FOR HIM HEARTENED HE PULLED AT THE VINE LOOP
1263-141777-0014 CLIMBED BACK INTO THE TREE MINUTES LATER HE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO OF THE BEASTS WAITING QUIETLY ABOUT THE CAMP AND THAT THEIR SENTRY LINE RAN BETWEEN HIM AND THE CLEARING OF THE L B HE WITHDREW FARTHER INTO THE WOOD
1263-141777-0015 INTENT UPON FINDING A DETOUR WHICH WOULD BRING HIM OUT INTO THE OPEN LANDS NOW HE WANTED TO JOIN FORCES WITH HIS OWN KIND WHETHER THOSE MEN WERE POTENTIAL ENEMIES OR NOT AS TIME PASSED THE BEASTS CLOSED ABOUT THE CLEARING OF THE CAMP
1263-141777-0016 AFTERNOON WAS FADING INTO EVENING WHEN HE REACHED A POINT SEVERAL MILES DOWNSTREAM NEAR THE RIVER SINCE HE HAD COME INTO THE OPEN HE HAD NOT SIGHTED ANY OF THE WATCHERS HE HOPED THEY DID NOT WILLINGLY VENTURE OUT OF THE TREES WHERE THE LEAVES WERE THEIR PROTECTION
1263-141777-0017 RYNCH WENT FLAT ON THE STREAM BANK MADE A WORM'S PROGRESS UP THE SLOPE TO CROUCH BEHIND A BUSH AND SURVEY THE LAND IMMEDIATELY AHEAD THERE STOOD AN OFF WORLD SPACER FINS DOWN NOSE SKYWARD
1263-141777-0018 AND GROUPED NOT TOO FAR FROM ITS LANDING RAMP A COLLECTION OF BUBBLE TENTS A FIRE BURNED IN THEIR MIDST AND MEN WERE MOVING ABOUT IT NOW THAT HE WAS FREE FROM THE WOOD AND ITS WATCHERS AND HAD COME SO NEAR TO HIS GOAL
1263-141777-0019 RYNCH WAS CURIOUSLY RELUCTANT TO DO THE SENSIBLE THING TO RISE OUT OF CONCEALMENT AND WALK UP TO THAT FIRE TO CLAIM RESCUE BY HIS OWN KIND THE MAN HE SOUGHT STOOD BY THE FIRE
1263-141777-0020 SHRUGGING HIS ARMS INTO A WEBBING HARNESS WHICH BROUGHT A BOX AGAINST HIS CHEST HAVING MADE THAT FAST HE PICKED UP A NEEDLER BY ITS SLING BY THEIR GESTURES THE OTHERS WERE ARGUING WITH HIM BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD CAME ON
1263-141777-0021 THAT IDEA MADE SENSE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD LET THE OTHER PAST HIM FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND UNTIL HE WAS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE CAMP SO THAT HIS FRIENDS COULD NOT INTERFERE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A MEETING
1263-141777-0022 IN SPITE OF HIS CAUTION RYNCH WAS CLOSE TO BETRAYAL AS HE EDGED AROUND A CLUMP OF VEGETATION GROWING HALF IN HALF OUT OF THE STREAM ONLY A TIMELY RUSTLE TOLD HIM THAT THE OTHER HAD SAT DOWN ON A DRIFT LOG WAITING FOR HIM RYNCH FROZE
1263-141777-0023 SO STARTLED THAT HE COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY FOR A SECOND THEN HE NOTED THAT THE OUTLINE OF THE OTHER'S BODY WAS VISIBLE GROWING BRIGHTER BY THE MOMENT MINUTE PARTICLES OF PALE GREENISH RADIANCE WERE GATHERING ABOUT THE OTHER THE DARK SHADOW OF AN ARM FLAPPED THE RADIANCE SWIRLED
1263-141777-0024 BUT THEY NO LONGER GATHERED IN STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIGHT HIS PRESENCE NOW HE COULD SEE THEY DRIFTED ABOUT THE VEGETATION ABOUT THE LOG WHERE THE MAN SAT ABOUT ROCKS AND REEDS ONLY THEY WERE THICKER ABOUT THE STRANGER AS IF HIS BODY WERE A MAGNET
1263-141777-0025 HE CONTINUED TO KEEP THEM WHIRLING BY MEANS OF WAVING HAND AND ARM BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH LIGHT TO SHOW RYNCH THE FINGERS OF HIS OTHER HAND BUSY ON THE FRONT PANEL OF THE BOX HE WORE THAT FINGERING STOPPED THEN RYNCH'S HEAD CAME UP AS HE HEARD A VERY FAINT SOUND
1263-141777-0026 NOT A BEAST'S CRY OR WAS IT AGAIN THOSE FINGERS MOVED ON THE PANEL WAS THE OTHER SENDING A MESSAGE BY THAT MEANS RYNCH WATCHED HIM CHECK THE WEBBING COUNT THE EQUIPMENT AT HIS BELT SETTLE THE NEEDLER IN THE CROOK OF HIS ARM
1263-141777-0027 HOWEVER THE OTHER WAS AS WARY OF THAT DARK AS IF HE SUSPECTED WHAT MIGHT LIE IN WAIT THERE HE ANGLED ALONG NORTHWARD AVOIDING CLUMPS OF SCATTERED BRUSH KEEPING IN THE OPEN WHERE RYNCH DARED NOT TAIL HIM TOO CLOSELY
1263-141777-0028 THEIR COURSE PARALLEL TO THE WOODS BROUGHT THEM AT LAST TO A SECOND STREAM THE SIZE OF A RIVER INTO WHICH THE FIRST CREEK EMPTIED HERE THE OTHER SETTLED DOWN BETWEEN TWO ROCKS WITH EVERY INDICATION OF REMAINING THERE FOR A PERIOD
1263-141777-0029 THANKFULLY RYNCH FOUND HIS OWN LURKING PLACE FROM WHICH HE COULD KEEP THE OTHER IN SIGHT THE LIGHT POINTS GATHERED HUNG IN A SMALL LUMINOUS CLOUD OVER THE ROCKS BUT RYNCH HAD PRUDENTLY WITHDRAWN UNDER A BUSH
1263-141777-0030 AND THE SCENT OF ITS AROMATIC LEAVES MUST HAVE DISCOURAGED THE SPARKS FOR NO SUCH CROWN CAME TO HIS SENTRY POST DRUGGED WITH FATIGUE THE YOUNGER MAN SLEPT AWAKING TO FULL DAY A FOG OF BEWILDERMENT
1263-141777-0031 WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE OTHER'S EXPEDITION WAS HE GOING TO USE THE OPEN CUT THROUGH WHICH THE RIVER RAN AS A WAY OF PENETRATING THE WOODED COUNTRY NOW RYNCH CONSIDERED THE PROBLEM FROM HIS OWN ANGLE THE MAN FROM THE SPACER HAD MADE NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS TRAIL
1263-141777-0032 IN FACT IT WOULD ALMOST SEEM THAT HE HAD DELIBERATELY GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO LEAVE BOOT PRINTS ON FAVORABLE STRETCHES OF GROUND DID HE GUESS THAT RYNCH LURKED BEHIND WAS NOW LEADING HIM ON FOR SOME PURPOSE OF HIS OWN
1263-141777-0033 OR WERE THOSE TRACES LEFT TO GUIDE ANOTHER PARTY FROM THE CAMP TO ADVANCE OPENLY UP THE STREAM BED WAS TO INVITE DISCOVERY RYNCH SURVEYED THE NEARER BANK CLUMPS OF SMALL TREES AND HIGH GROWING BUSHES DOTTED THAT EXPANSE AN IDEAL COVER
1263-141777-0034 THAT SOUND OF SNARLING SPITTING HATE ENDED IN MID CRY AS RYNCH CRAWLED TO THE RIVER BANK THE MAN FROM THE SPACER CAMP HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF A THREE PRONG ATTACK FROM A FEMALE AND HER CUBS
1263-141777-0035 THREE RED BODIES WERE FLAT AND STILL ON THE GRAVEL AS THE OFF WORLDER LEANED BACK AGAINST A ROCK BREATHING HEAVILY AS RYNCH SIGHTED HIM HE STOOPED TO RECOVER THE NEEDLER HE HAD DROPPED LURCHED AWAY FROM THE ROCK TOWARDS THE WATER
1263-141777-0036 CLAWED AT THE GROUND ABOUT HIM ALREADY HE WAS BURIED TO HIS KNEES THEN HIS MID THIGHS IN THE ARTIFICIAL QUICKSAND BUT HE HAD NOT LOST HIS HEAD AND WAS JERKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN AN EFFORT TO PULL FREE RYNCH GOT TO HIS FEET
1263-141777-0037 WALKED WITH SLOW DELIBERATION DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BRINK THE TRAPPED PRISONER HAD SHIED HALFWAY AROUND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS TO FIND A FIRMER GRIP ON SOME ROCK LARGE AND HEAVY ENOUGH TO ANCHOR HIM AFTER HIS FIRST STARTLED CRY HE HAD MADE NO SOUND
1263-141777-0038 BUT NOW AS HE SIGHTED RYNCH HIS EYES WIDENED AND HIS LIPS PARTED THE BOX ON HIS CHEST CAUGHT ON A STONE HE HAD DRAGGED TO HIM IN A DESPERATE TRY FOR SUPPORT
1263-141777-0039 THERE WAS A SPITTING OF SPARKS AND THE STRANGER WORKED FRANTICALLY AT THE BUCKLE OF THE WEBBING HARNESS TO LOOSEN IT AND TOSS THE WHOLE THING FROM HIM THE BOX STRUCK ONE OF THE DEAD WATER CATS FLASHED AS FUR AND FLESH WERE SINGED
1263-141777-0040 RYNCH WATCHED DISPASSIONATELY BEFORE HE CAUGHT THE NEEDLER JERKING IT AWAY FROM THE PRISONER THE MAN EYED HIM STEADILY AND HIS EXPRESSION DID NOT ALTER EVEN WHEN RYNCH SWUNG THE OFF WORLD WEAPON TO CENTER ITS SIGHTS ON THE LATE OWNER

1183-128659-0016 I THINK HOWEVER THAT I RATHER LIKED TO SUPPOSE IT TRUE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED IN THE EXPLANATION
1183-128659-0017 THUS IN CROQUET NO CHILD IN A TOWN NEAR BOSTON WOULD TAKE THE RED BALL BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO MEAN HATE

2384-152900-0000 SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
2384-152900-0001 IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
2384-152900-0002 ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
2384-152900-0003 THE OTHER ROOM WAS SIX AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO BE LINDSTROEM'S KITCHEN FROM THE KITCHEN A DOUBLE TRAP DOOR LED TO THE LOFT WHERE WE INTENDED TO KEEP A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AND OUTFIT THE WALLS CONSISTED OF THREE INCH PLANKS
2384-152900-0004 FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
2384-152900-0005 THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
2384-152900-0006 FOR THE COVERING OF THE ROOF WE TOOK OUT ROOFING PAPER AND FOR THE FLOOR LINOLEUM IN THE MAIN ROOM THERE WERE TWO AIR PIPES
2384-152900-0007 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0008 THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
2384-152900-0009 AND THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOF WE CARRIED SIX STRONG EYEBOLTS A METRE LONG TO BE RAMMED INTO THE BARRIER BETWEEN THESE BOLTS AND THOSE ON THE HUT STEEL WIRES WERE TO BE STRETCHED WHICH COULD BE DRAWN QUITE TIGHT WE ALSO HAD TWO SPARE CABLES
2384-152900-0010 WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
2384-152900-0011 AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
2384-152900-0012 THEY WERE SERVED OUT TO US FROM THE NAVAL STORES THE OTHER FIVE WERE NEW AND WE BOUGHT THEM FROM THE ARMY DEPOTS IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE THE TENTS AS TEMPORARY HOUSES THEY WERE EASILY AND QUICKLY SET UP AND WERE STRONG AND WARM
2384-152900-0013 ON THE VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH ROENNE SEWED NEW FLOORS OF GOOD STRONG CANVAS TO THE FIVE NEW TENTS ALL CASES OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR WINTER QUARTERS WERE MARKED AND STOWED SEPARATELY IN THE HOLD
2384-152900-0014 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0015 THE OTHER PARTS WERE OF GOOD TOUGH NORWEGIAN ASH TO EACH SLEDGE BELONGED A PAIR OF SPARE RUNNERS WHICH COULD EASILY BE FITTED UNDERNEATH BY MEANS OF CLAMPS AND AS EASILY REMOVED WHEN NOT REQUIRED
2384-152900-0016 THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
2384-152900-0017 I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
2384-152900-0018 I CHOSE THEM OF THIS LENGTH WITH A VIEW TO BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE NUMEROUS CRACKS IN THE GLACIERS THE GREATER THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE WEIGHT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE BETTER PROSPECT WE SHOULD HAVE OF SLIPPING OVER THE SNOW BRIDGES
2384-152900-0019 WE HAD FORTY SKI POLES WITH EBONITE POINTS THE SKI BINDINGS WERE A COMBINATION OF THE HUITFELDT AND THE HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS WE ALSO HAD QUANTITIES OF LOOSE STRAPS
2384-152900-0020 WE HAD SIX THREE MAN TENTS ALL MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS THE WORKMANSHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER THEY WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL TENTS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN USED THEY WERE MADE OF THE CLOSEST CANVAS WITH THE FLOOR IN ONE PIECE
2384-152900-0021 ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
2384-152900-0022 HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
2384-152900-0023 THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
2384-152900-0024 WHICH CAME FROM THE ESTATE OF PALSGAARD IN JUTLAND AND THE MATERIAL DID ALL IT PROMISED THESE CASES WERE ONE FOOT SQUARE AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
2384-152900-0025 THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
2384-152900-0026 AND THIS IS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE WE COULD ALWAYS GET AT IT A CASE WITH A LARGE LID COVERED BY THE LASHING GIVES CONSTANT TROUBLE THE WHOLE LASHING HAS TO BE UNDONE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING ONE WANTS OUT OF THE CASE THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT
2384-152900-0027 IF ONE IS TIRED AND SLACK IT MAY SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT ONE WILL PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS BITTERLY COLD
2384-152900-0028 THE HANDIER ONE'S SLEDGING OUTFIT THE SOONER ONE GETS INTO THE TENT AND TO REST AND THAT IS NO SMALL CONSIDERATION ON A LONG JOURNEY OUR OUTFIT OF CLOTHING WAS ABUNDANT AND MORE COMPLETE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT OF ANY FORMER POLAR EXPEDITION
2384-152900-0029 WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
2384-152900-0030 IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH ANY DEGREE OF COLD WE WERE SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHEST ASSORTMENT OF REINDEER SKIN CLOTHING WE HAD IT SPECIALLY THICK MEDIUM AND QUITE LIGHT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THESE SKIN CLOTHES PREPARED
2384-152900-0031 FIRST THE REINDEER SKINS HAD TO BE BOUGHT IN A RAW STATE
2384-152900-0032 LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
2384-152900-0033 WITH HIS HELP I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THINGS THAT I SHOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HE SHRANK FROM NO AMOUNT OF WORK BUT WENT ON TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT I WANTED
2384-152900-0034 THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
2384-152900-0035 WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
2384-152900-0036 WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
2384-152900-0037 AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
2384-152900-0038 WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
2384-152900-0039 IN THIS WAY WE ALWAYS KEPT OURSELVES FREE FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF DRIFTING SNOW WE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE BAGS MADE OF THE VERY BEST SORT OF SKIN AND TOOK CARE THAT THE THIN SKIN OF THE BELLY WAS REMOVED
2384-152900-0040 AS OF COURSE THE COLD PENETRATES MORE EASILY THROUGH THE THIN SKIN AND GIVES RISE TO DAMPNESS IN THE FORM OF RIME ON MEETING THE WARMTH OF THE BODY THESE THIN PATCHES REMAIN DAMP WHENEVER ONE IS IN THE BAG AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY LOSE THEIR HAIR
2384-152900-0041 THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
2384-152900-0042 OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
2384-152900-0043 WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
2384-152900-0044 BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
2384-152900-0045 THE LINING OF COURSE WAS TORN IN PLACES BUT THE SEAMS OF THE MITS WERE JUST AS PERFECT AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT I WENT ON SKI THE WHOLE WAY AND USED TWO POLES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MITS WERE STRONGLY MADE
2384-152900-0046 WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
2384-152900-0047 FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
2384-152900-0048 AND THIS IS A SUFFICIENTLY TROUBLESOME PIECE OF WORK TO MAKE ONE DISINCLINED TO UNDO IT AGAIN UNTIL ONE IS TURNING IN THEY CANNOT BE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ONE HAS TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON FEELING BUT FEELING IN THIS CASE OFTEN PLAYS CURIOUS TRICKS
2384-152900-0049 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0050 IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITIONAL STAGE WHEN ONE FEELS THE COLD SMARTING IN ONE'S TOES AND TRIES TO GET RID OF IT BY STAMPING THE FEET AS A RULE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THE WARMTH RETURNS OR THE CIRCULATION IS RESTORED
2384-152900-0051 BUT IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS THAT SENSATION IS LOST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN AND THEN ONE MUST BE AN OLD HAND TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED MANY MEN CONCLUDE THAT AS THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE UNPLEASANT SMARTING SENSATION ALL IS WELL
2384-152900-0052 AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
2384-152900-0053 TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
2384-152900-0054 THE FOOT CAN MOVE FAR MORE EASILY AND KEEP WARM BUT WE WERE TO TAKE SKI AND TO GET FULL USE OUT OF THEM SO THAT IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO HAVE A STIFF SOLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BINDINGS IT IS OF NO USE TO HAVE A GOOD BINDING UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY
2384-152900-0055 IN MY OPINION ON A LONG JOURNEY SUCH AS THAT WE HAD BEFORE US THE SKI MUST BE PERFECTLY STEADY I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING THAT TIRES ME MORE THAN A BAD FASTENING THAT IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FOOT TO SHIFT IN THE BINDING
2384-152900-0056 I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
2384-152900-0057 I DECIDED THIS TIME TO TRY A COMBINATION OF STIFF AND SOFT FOOT GEAR SO THAT WE COULD USE THE SPLENDID HUITFELDT HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS BUT THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER OF OUR WHOLE OUTFIT NOTHING CAUSED ME MORE WORRY
2384-152900-0058 OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
2384-152900-0059 FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0060 IN ORDER TO AVOID LEATHER WHICH USUALLY BECOMES STIFF AND EASILY CRACKED IN THE COLD HE WAS TO USE A COMBINATION OF LEATHER AND THIN CANVAS FOR THE UPPERS LEATHER NEAREST THE SOLE AND CANVAS ABOVE IT THE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM MY FOOT
2384-152900-0061 WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
2384-152900-0062 THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
2384-152900-0063 IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
2384-152900-0064 I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
2384-152900-0065 FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
2384-152900-0066 IT GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT USES LITTLE OIL AND REQUIRES NO ATTENTION ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH ANYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN SLEDGING THERE IS NEVER ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS APPARATUS IT HAS COME AS NEAR PERFECTION AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0067 WE TOOK FIVE NANSEN COOKERS WITH US THIS COOKER UTILIZES THE HEAT MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANY OTHER BUT I HAVE ONE OBJECTION TO MAKE TO IT IT TAKES UP SPACE WE USED IT ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEYS
2384-152900-0068 BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
2384-152900-0069 WE HAD WITH US TEN PAIRS OF SNOW SHOES AND ONE HUNDRED SETS OF DOG HARNESS OF THE ALASKA ESKIMO PATTERN THE ALASKA ESKIMO DRIVE THEIR DOGS IN TANDEM THE WHOLE PULL IS THUS STRAIGHT AHEAD IN THE DIRECTION THE SLEDGE IS GOING
2384-152900-0070 AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
2384-152900-0071 SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
2384-152900-0072 WHICH IS SLIPPED OVER THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND MAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE PULL COME ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEREAS THE GREENLAND HARNESS PRESSES ON HIS CHEST RAW PLACES WHICH OCCUR RATHER FREQUENTLY WITH THE GREENLAND HARNESS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AVOIDED WITH THE OTHER
2384-152900-0073 ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
2384-152900-0074 THREE ARTIFICIAL HORIZONS OF WHICH TWO WERE GLASS HORIZONS WITH DARK GLASSES AND ONE A MERCURY HORIZON AND FOUR SPIRIT COMPASSES MADE IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE EXCELLENT LITTLE COMPASSES
2384-152900-0075 I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
2384-152900-0076 THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
2384-152900-0077 AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
2384-152900-0078 DURING THE WHOLE STAY ON THE BARRIER I MYSELF WORE A PAIR OF ORDINARY SPECTACLES WITH YELLOW GLASSES OF QUITE A LIGHT TINT
2384-152900-0079 HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2384-152900-0080 IT WILL PERHAPS BE SUGGESTED THAT I AM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS AILMENT THAN OTHERS BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD SEVERAL SEVERE ATTACKS OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAD TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS AN AIR THERMOMETER
2384-152900-0081 TWO ANEROIDS WITH ALTITUDE SCALE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET AND TWO HYPSOMETERS THE HYPSOMETER IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE BOILING POINT WHICH GIVES ONE THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA THE METHOD IS BOTH SIMPLE AND RELIABLE
2384-152900-0082 THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
2384-152900-0083 OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
2384-152900-0084 I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF THE PEMMICAN I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A WHOLE GROCER'S SHOP WITH ME WHEN SLEDGING THE FOOD SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND NOURISHING AND THAT IS ENOUGH A RICH AND VARIED MENU IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO DO
2384-152900-0085 BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
2384-152900-0086 THEY WERE EXTREMELY NOURISHING AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE THANKS TO EFFICIENT PACKING THEY KEPT FRESH AND CRISP ALL THE TIME THESE BISCUITS FORMED A GREAT PART OF OUR DAILY DIET AND UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT
2384-152900-0087 MILK POWDER IS A COMPARATIVELY NEW COMMODITY WITH US BUT IT DESERVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN IT CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF JAEDEREN NEITHER HEAT NOR COLD DRYNESS NOR WET COULD HURT IT
2384-152900-0088 WE HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT LYING OUT IN SMALL THIN LINEN BAGS IN EVERY POSSIBLE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE POWDER WAS AS GOOD THE LAST DAY AS THE FIRST WE ALSO TOOK DRIED MILK FROM A FIRM IN WISCONSIN THIS MILK HAD AN ADDITION OF MALT AND SUGAR
2384-152900-0089 AND WAS IN MY OPINION EXCELLENT IT ALSO KEPT GOOD THE WHOLE TIME THE CHOCOLATE CAME FROM A WORLD RENOWNED FIRM AND WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE THE WHOLE SUPPLY WAS A VERY ACCEPTABLE GIFT
6836-61804-0000 WHO CAN BLAME HER FOR GIVING WAY TO THE SUBDUED HAPPINESS THAT SUCCEEDED NOT I NOT YOU IF YOU SPEAK TRULY THE PASSION THAT CONTROLLED HER MAY NOT BE POPULAR UNDER A STRICTLY PURITAN STANDARD
6836-61804-0001 UNIVERSAL AND IRRESISTIBLE TELLING US THAT FATHER MOTHER SISTER AND BROTHER ARE ALL TO BE FORSAKEN FOR THAT LOVE ILLIMITABLE
6836-61804-0002 DO NOT REPROACH THE YOUNG CREOLE BECAUSE THIS PASSION WAS PARAMOUNT IN HER SOUL DO NOT BLAME HER FOR FEELING PLEASURE AMIDST MOMENTS THAT SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO SADNESS
6836-61804-0003 NOR THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS HEIGHTENED ON LEARNING FROM THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS HOW HER LOVER'S LIFE HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS IT MIGHT SEEM MIRACULOUSLY THE AIM OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0004 HAD BEEN TRUE ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE FELT SURE OF IT BEFORE TURNING THE MUZZLE TOWARDS HIS OWN TEMPLES AND FIRING THE BULLET THAT HAD LODGED IN HIS BRAIN
6836-61804-0005 RIGHT OVER THE HEART HE HAD HIT HIS INTENDED VICTIM AND THROUGH THE HEART WOULD THE LEADEN MISSILE HAVE MADE ITS WAY
6836-61804-0006 THE GIFT OF HER WHO ALONE COULD HAVE SECURED IT SUCH A PLACE TURNED ASIDE THE SHOT CAUSING IT TO RICOCHET NOT HARMLESSLY HOWEVER
6836-61804-0007 WITH THE MENTAL AND CORPOREAL EXCITEMENT LONG SUSTAINED DID NOT FAIL TO PRODUCE ITS EFFECT AND THE MIND OF MAURICE GERALD ONCE MORE RETURNED TO ITS DELIRIOUS DREAMING
6836-61804-0008 BUT NO LONGER LAY HIS BODY IN DANGER IN THE CHAPPARAL SURROUNDED BY WOLVES AND SHADOWED BY SOARING VULTURES IN A HUT WHERE HE WAS BUT ILL ATTENDED
6836-61804-0009 IN A JAIL WHERE HE WAS SCARCE CARED FOR AT ALL WHEN AGAIN RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAIR VISION OF HIS DREAMS WAS NO VISION AT ALL BUT A LOVELY WOMAN
6836-61804-0010 THE SPIRIT OF THE ARISTOCRATIC PLANTER STEEPED IN SORROW AND HUMILIATED BY MISFORTUNE HAD BECOME PURGED OF ITS FALSE PRIDE THOUGH IT NEEDED NOT THIS TO MAKE HIM WILLINGLY ACQUIESCE IN AN ALLIANCE
6836-61804-0011 WHICH INSTEAD OF A NOBODY GAVE HIM A NOBLEMAN FOR HIS SON SUCH IN REALITY WAS SIR MAURICE GERALD ERST KNOWN AS MAURICE THE MUSTANGER IN TEXAS
6836-61804-0012 THE TITLE WOULD HAVE COUNTED FOR LITTLE NOR DID ITS OWNER CARE TO CARRY IT BUT BY A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE NOT ALWAYS ATTENDANT ON AN IRISH BARONETCY
6836-61804-0013 IT CARRIED ALONG WITH IT AN ENDOWMENT AMPLE ENOUGH TO CLEAR CASA DEL CORVO OF THE MORTGAGE HELD BY THE LATE CASSIUS CALHOUN AND CLAIMED BY HIS NEAREST OF KIN THIS WAS NOT WOODLEY POINDEXTER
6836-61804-0014 FOR AFTER CALHOUN'S DEATH IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE EX CAPTAIN HAD ONCE BEEN A BENEDICT AND THERE WAS A YOUNG SCION OF HIS STOCK LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS WHO HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SAY HE WAS HIS SON
6836-61804-0015 IT MATTERED NOT TO MAURICE GERALD WHO NOW CLEAR OF EVERY ENTANGLEMENT BECAME THE HUSBAND OF THE FAIR CREOLE AFTER A VISIT TO HIS NATIVE LAND INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN TOUR
6836-61804-0016 LOUISE POINDEXTER LADY GERALD SHE MUST NOW BE CALLED DURING HER SOJOURN IN THE EMERALD ISLE SAW NOTHING TO EXCITE HER TO JEALOUSY ONLY ONCE AGAIN DID THIS FELL PASSION
6836-61804-0017 TAKE POSSESSION OF HER SPIRIT AND THEN ONLY IN THE SHAPE OF A SHADOW SOON TO PASS AWAY IT WAS ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME HOME TO THE HACIENDA BEARING IN HIS ARMS THE BODY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
6836-61804-0018 NOT YET DEAD THOUGH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HER BARED BOSOM SHOWED SHE HAD NOT LONG TO LIVE TO THE QUESTION WHO HAS DONE THIS SHE WAS ONLY ABLE TO ANSWER DIAZ
6836-61804-0019 DIAZ IT WAS THE LAST UTTERANCE OF
6836-61804-0020 COVARUBIO DE LOS LLANOS AS THE SPIRIT OF THE UNHAPPY SENORITA PASSED INTO ETERNITY
6836-61804-0021 WHOSE STORY SHE NOW BETTER COMPREHENDED SHE EVEN ASSISTED HER LORD IN THE SADDLING OF HIS RED BAY STEED AND ENCOURAGED HIM IN THE PURSUIT OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0022 SHE JOYED TO SEE THE LATTER LED BACK AT THE END OF A LAZO HELD IN THE HAND OF HER HUSBAND AND REFUSED TO INTERFERE WHEN A BAND OF REGULATORS CALLED HASTILY TOGETHER
6836-61804-0023 DEALT OUT SUMMARY CHASTISEMENT BY HANGING HIM TO A TREE IT WAS NOT CRUELTY ONLY A CRUDE KIND OF JUSTICE AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH
6836-61804-0024 AND WHAT A POOR COMPENSATION IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN EXACTING IT AS THEY STOOD GAZING UPON THE REMAINS OF THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM THE SWARTH RUFFIAN DANGLING FROM THE BRANCH ABOVE
6836-61804-0025 AND THE FAIR FORM LYING UNDERNEATH THE HEARTS OF THE TEXANS WERE TOUCHED AS PERHAPS THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A STRANGE THOUGHT PASSING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
6836-61804-0026 A SADNESS INDEPENDENT OF THAT CAUSED BY THE SPECTACLE OF A MURDER IT WAS REGRET AT HAVING SO HASTILY DESPATCHED THE ASSASSIN BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN DEATH WAS ISIDORA SUCH FEATURES AS SHE POSSESSED
6836-61804-0027 AT LENGTH GOING WITH THOUGHTS NOT ALTOGETHER SACRED IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD TIME IS ACCOUNTED THE DESTROYER THOUGH IN THE MORAL IT IS OFT THE RESTORER
6836-61804-0028 NOWHERE HAS IT EFFECTED GREATER CHANGES THAN IN TEXAS DURING THE LAST DECADE AND ESPECIALLY
6836-61804-0029 PLANTATIONS HAVE SPRUNG UP WHERE LATE THE CHAPPARAL THICKLY COVERED THE EARTH AND CITIES STAND WHERE THE WILD STEED ONCE ROAMED OVER A PATHLESS PRAIRIE
6836-61804-0030 YOU WOULD BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF A HOSPITALITY UNEQUALLED IN EUROPEAN LANDS YOU WOULD HAVE FOR YOUR HOST ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST MEN IN TEXAS FOR YOUR HOSTESS ONE OF ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
6836-61804-0031 BOTH STILL THIS SIDE OF MIDDLE LIFE RESIDING UNDER THEIR ROOF YOU WOULD FIND AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF ARISTOCRATIC AIR AND VENERABLE ASPECT WITHAL CHATTY AND CHEERFUL WHO WOULD CONDUCT YOU AROUND THE CORRALES
6836-61804-0032 SHOW YOU THE STOCK AND NEVER TIRE OF TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS AY THOUSANDS OF HORSES AND HORNED CATTLE SEEN ROAMING OVER THE PASTURES OF THE PLANTATION
6836-61804-0033 LEAVING HIM FOR A TIME YOU WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS ATTACHED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT ONE IS THE GROOM OF THE STOLE BY NAME PHELIM O'NEAL
6836-61804-0034 WHO HAS FULL CHARGE OF THE HORSES THE OTHER A COACHMAN OF SABLE SKIN YCLEPT PLUTO POINDEXTER WHO WOULD SCORN TO LOOK AT A HORSE EXCEPT WHEN PERCHED UPON THE BOX
6836-61804-0035 AND AFTER HAVING THE RIBBONS DEFTLY DELIVERED INTO HIS HANDS SINCE WE LAST SAW HIM THE GAY PLUTO HAS BECOME TAMED DOWN TO A STAID AND SOBER BENEDICT BLACK THOUGH HE BE
6836-61804-0036 FLORINDA NOW THE BETTER HALF OF HIS LIFE HAS EFFECTED THE TRANSFORMATION
6836-61804-0037 AND BACK ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE RETIRED BUT THE HUGE GOBBLER SEEN IN THE SMOKE HOUSE
6836-61804-0038 THE DOMESTICS WILL TELL IT YOU BUT ONLY IN WHISPERS SINCE THEY KNOW THAT IT IS A THEME TABOOED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE MANSION IN WHOM IT EXCITES SAD SOUVENIRS IT IS THE STORY
6836-76549-0000 AT LA PORTE THE ROADS IMPROVE FOR SOME DISTANCE BUT ONCE AGAIN I AM BENIGHTED AND SLEEP UNDER A WHEAT SHOCK TRAVERSING SEVERAL MILES OF CORDUROY ROAD THROUGH HUCKLEBERRY SWAMPS NEXT MORNING I REACH CRAM'S POINT FOR BREAKFAST
6836-76549-0001 A REMNANT OF SOME INDIAN TRIBE STILL LINGERS AROUND HERE AND GATHERS HUCKLEBERRIES FOR THE MARKET TWO SQUAWS BEING IN THE VILLAGE PURCHASING SUPPLIES FOR THEIR CAMP IN THE SWAMPS WHAT'S THE NAME OF THESE INDIANS HERE I ASK
6836-76549-0002 SPLENDID GRAVEL ROADS LEAD FROM CRUM'S POINT TO SOUTH BEND AND ON THROUGH MISHAWAKA ALTERNATING WITH SANDY STRETCHES TO GOSHEN WHICH TOWN IS SAID BY THE GOSHENITES TO BE THE PRETTIEST IN INDIANA
6836-76549-0003 BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CONSIDERABLE PRIDE OF LOCALITY IN THE GREAT HOOSIER STATE AND I VENTURE THERE ARE SCORES OF PRETTIEST TOWNS IN INDIANA NEVERTHELESS GOSHEN IS CERTAINLY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE WITH UNUSUALLY BROAD WELL SHADED STREETS
6836-76549-0004 HAS HAD AN EXTRA STOUT BONE SHAKER MADE TO ORDER
6836-76549-0005 WHO BEING ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT LESS BULKY RIDE REGULATION WHEELS JUMBO GOES ALL RIGHT WHEN MOUNTED BUT BEING UNABLE TO MOUNT WITHOUT AID HE SELDOM VENTURES ABROAD BY HIMSELF FOR FEAR OF HAVING TO FOOT IT BACK
6836-76549-0006 IS SO DELIGHTFULLY ROMANTIC AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JULY SEVENTEENTH I BOWL ACROSS THE BOUNDARY LINE INTO OHIO FOLLOWING THE MERCHANTS AND BANKERS TELEGRAPH ROAD TO NAPOLEON I PASS THROUGH A DISTRICT WHERE THE RAIN HAS OVERLOOKED THEM FOR TWO MONTHS
6836-76549-0007 IS HALF BURIED IN HOT DUST THE BLACKBERRIES ARE DEAD ON THE BUSHES AND THE LONG SUFFERING CORN LOOKS AS THOUGH AFFLICTED WITH THE YELLOW JAUNDICE
6836-76549-0008 AND SCARCELY KNOW A WORD OF ENGLISH YET A FAT PHLEGMATIC LOOKING BABY IS PEACEFULLY REPOSING IN A CRADLE WHICH IS SIMPLY HALF A MONSTER PUMPKIN SCOOPED OUT AND DRIED IT IS THE MOST INTENSELY RUSTIC CRADLE IN THE WORLD
6836-76549-0009 SURELY THIS YOUNGSTER'S HEAD OUGHT TO BE LEVEL ON AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS WHEN HE GROWS UP IF ANYBODY'S OUGHT FROM NAPOLEON MY ROUTE LEADS UP THE MAUMEE RIVER AND CANAL FIRST TRYING THE TOW PATH OF THE LATTER AND THEN RELINQUISHING IT FOR
6836-76549-0010 THE VERY FAIR WAGON ROAD THE MAUMEE RIVER WINDING THROUGH ITS SPLENDID RICH VALLEY SEEMS TO POSSESS A PECULIAR BEAUTY ALL ITS OWN AND MY MIND UNBIDDEN MENTALLY COMPARES IT WITH OUR OLD FRIEND THE HUMBOLDT
6836-76549-0011 THE LATTER STREAM TRAVERSES DREARY PLAINS WHERE ALMOST NOTHING BUT SAGEBRUSH GROWS THE MAUMEE WATERS A SMILING VALLEY WHERE ORCHARDS FIELDS AND MEADOWS ALTERNATE WITH SUGAR MAPLE GROVES
6836-76549-0012 AND IN ITS FAIR BOSOM REFLECTS BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE VIEWS THAT ARE CHANGED AND REBEAUTIFIED BY THE MASTER HAND OF THE SUN EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY AND DOUBLY EMBELLISHED AT NIGHT BY THE MOON IT IS WHISPERED THAT DURING THE LATE UNPLEASANTNESS
6836-76549-0013 THE OHIO REGIMENTS COULD OUT YELL THE LOUISIANA TIGERS OR ANY OTHER CONFEDERATE TROOPS TWO TO ONE WHO HAS NOT HEARD THE OHIO YELL MOST PEOPLE ARE MAGNANIMOUSLY INCLINED TO REGARD THIS RUMOR AS SIMPLY A GAG ON THE BUCKEYE BOYS
6836-76549-0014 BUT IT ISN'T THE OHIOANS ARE TO THE MANNER BORN THE BUCKEYE YELL IS A TANGIBLE FACT ALL ALONG THE MAUMEE IT RESOUNDS IN MY EARS NEARLY EVERY MAN OR BOY WHO FROM THE FIELDS FAR OR NEAR

6836-76549-0020 BOTH SIDES OF WHICH ARE LINED WITH MAGNIFICENT FARMS WHOSE FIELDS AND MEADOWS FAIRLY GROAN BENEATH THEIR WEALTH OF PRODUCE WHOSE FRUCTIFEROUS ORCHARDS ARC MARVELS OF PRODUCTIVENESS
6836-76549-0021 THE GLEAMING WATERS OF LAKE ERIE HERE AND THERE GLISTEN LIKE BURNISHED STEEL THROUGH THE DISTANT INTERSPACES AND AWAY BEYOND STRETCHES NORTHWARD LIKE A VAST MIRROR TO KISS THE BLUE CANADIAN SKIES
6836-76549-0022 WHERE FROM THE LITTLE HAMLET OF SPRINGFIELD THE ROADS BECOME GOOD THEN BETTER AND FINALLY BEST AT GIRARD THE HOME OF THE VETERAN SHOWMAN DAN RICE THE BEAUTIFYING WORKS OF WHOSE GENEROUS HAND ARE EVERYWHERE VISIBLE IN HIS NATIVE TOWN
6836-76549-0023 AND SO IT CONTINUES WITH EVER VARYING EVER PLEASING BEAUTY TO ERIE AFTER WHICH THE HIGHWAY BECOMES HARDLY SO GOOD TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER ENTERING PENNSYLVANIA I MAKE MY EXIT ACROSS THE BOUNDARY
6836-76549-0024 IS POPULARLY BELIEVED BY MANY OF ITS NUMEROUS LOCAL ADMIRERS TO BE THE HIGHEST NAVIGABLE LAKE IN THE WORLD IF SO HOWEVER LAKE TAHOE IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS COMES NEXT
6836-76549-0025 AS IT IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND HAS THREE STEAMERS PLYING ON ITS WATERS AT FREDONIA I AM SHOWN THROUGH THE CELEBRATED WATCH MOVEMENT FACTORY HERE
6836-76549-0026 NO WHEELMAN HAS EVER YET RODE UP THIS HILL SAVE THE MUSCULAR AND GRITTY CAPTAIN OF THE FREDONIA CLUB THOUGH SEVERAL HAVE ATTEMPTED THE FEAT FROM THE TOP MY ROAD AHEAD IS PLAINLY VISIBLE FOR MILES
6836-76549-0027 LEADING THROUGH THE BROAD AND SMILING CATTARAUGUS VALLEY THAT IS SPREAD OUT LIKE A VAST GARDEN BELOW THROUGH WHICH CATTARAUGUS CREEK SLOWLY WINDS ITS TORTUOUS WAY STOPPING OVER NIGHT AT ANGOLA
6836-76549-0028 I PROCEED TO BUFFALO NEXT MORNING CATCHING THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THAT IMPORTANT SEAPORT OF THE LAKES WHERE FIFTEEN MILES ACROSS THE BAY THE WAGON ROAD IS ALMOST LICKED BY THE SWASHING WAVES AND ENTERING THE CITY OVER A MISFIT PLANK ROAD
6836-76549-0029 BY THE MOST AUDACIOUSLY INDIFFERENT WOMAN IN THE WORLD A MARKET WOMAN HOMEWARD BOUND WITH HER EMPTY TRUCK WAGON RECOGNIZES MY ROAD RIGHTS TO THE EXTENT OF BARELY ROOM TO SQUEEZE PAST BETWEEN HER WAGON AND THE DITCH
6836-76549-0030 AND HOLDS HER LONG STIFF BUGGY WHIP SO THAT IT SWIPES ME VICIOUSLY ACROSS THE FACE KNOCKS MY HELMET OFF INTO THE MUD DITCH
6836-76549-0031 THE WOMAN A CRIMSON CRESTED BLONDE JOGS SERENELY ALONG WITHOUT EVEN DEIGNING TO TURN HER HEAD LEAVING THE BICYCLE AT ISHAM'S WHO VOLUNTEERS SOME SLIGHT REPAIRS
6836-76549-0032 I TAKE A FLYING VISIT BY RAIL TO SEE NIAGARA FALLS RETURNING THE SAME EVENING TO ENJOY THE PROFFERED HOSPITALITY OF A GENIAL MEMBER OF THE BUFFALO BICYCLE CLUB
3723-171631-0000 MINISTRANT ARS ET NATURA INSTILLANT THEY USE CORDIALS TO KEEP THE VENOM AND MALIGNITY OF THE DISEASE FROM THE HEART ELEVEN MEDITATION
3723-171631-0001 WHENCE CAN WE TAKE A BETTER ARGUMENT A CLEARER DEMONSTRATION THAT ALL THE GREATNESS OF THIS WORLD IS BUILT UPON OPINION OF OTHERS AND HATH IN ITSELF NO REAL BEING NOR POWER OF SUBSISTENCE
3723-171631-0002 THAN FROM THE HEART OF MAN IT IS ALWAYS IN ACTION AND MOTION STILL BUSY STILL PRETENDING TO DO ALL TO FURNISH ALL THE POWERS AND FACULTIES WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE
3723-171631-0003 BUT IF AN ENEMY DARE RISE UP AGAINST IT IT IS THE SOONEST ENDANGERED THE SOONEST DEFEATED OF ANY PART THE BRAIN WILL HOLD OUT LONGER THAN IT AND THE LIVER LONGER THAN THAT THEY WILL ENDURE A SIEGE
3723-171631-0004 BUT AN UNNATURAL HEAT A REBELLIOUS HEAT WILL BLOW UP THE HEART LIKE A MINE IN A MINUTE BUT HOWSOEVER SINCE THE HEART HATH THE BIRTHRIGHT AND PRIMOGENITURE AND THAT IT IS NATURE'S ELDEST SON IN US
3723-171631-0005 THE PART WHICH IS FIRST BORN TO LIFE IN MAN AND THAT THE OTHER PARTS AS YOUNGER BRETHREN AND SERVANTS IN HIS FAMILY HAVE A DEPENDANCE UPON IT IT IS REASON THAT THE PRINCIPAL CARE BE HAD OF IT
3723-171631-0006 THOUGH IT BE NOT THE STRONGEST PART AS THE ELDEST IS OFTENTIMES NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE FAMILY AND SINCE THE BRAIN AND LIVER AND HEART HOLD NOT A TRIUMVIRATE IN MAN A SOVEREIGNTY EQUALLY SHED UPON THEM ALL
3723-171631-0007 MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AS CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS AS ALL PERSONS TO ALL KINDS OF SUPERIORS THOUGH OFTENTIMES THOSE PARENTS OR THOSE SUPERIORS
3723-171631-0008 THAT SERVE AND OBEY THEM THAT ARE WEAKER NEITHER DOTH THIS OBLIGATION FALL UPON US BY SECOND DICTATES OF NATURE BY CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING OUT OF NATURE OR DERIVED FROM NATURE BY DISCOURSE
3723-171631-0009 AS ALL LAWS OF PROPRIETY IN THAT WHICH WE POSSESS ARE OF THE LAW OF NATURE WHICH LAW IS TO GIVE EVERY ONE HIS OWN AND YET IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF NATURE THERE WAS NO PROPRIETY
3723-171631-0010 NO MEUM ET TUUM BUT AN UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY OVERALL
3723-171631-0011 WHICH IS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE CARE OF OUR OWN PRESERVATION TO LOOK FIRST TO OURSELVES FOR THEREFORE DOTH THE PHYSICIAN INTERMIT THE PRESENT CARE OF BRAIN OR LIVER
3723-171631-0012 BECAUSE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY SUBSIST THOUGH THERE BE NOT A PRESENT AND A PARTICULAR CARE HAD OF THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THEY CAN SUBSIST IF THE HEART PERISH
3723-171631-0013 AND THIS IS THE REWARD OF THE PAINS OF KINGS SOMETIMES THEY NEED THE POWER OF LAW TO BE OBEYED AND WHEN THEY SEEM TO BE OBEYED VOLUNTARILY THEY WHO DO IT DO IT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
3723-171631-0014 O HOW LITTLE A THING IS ALL THE GREATNESS OF MAN AND THROUGH HOW FALSE GLASSES DOTH HE MAKE SHIFT TO MULTIPLY IT AND MAGNIFY IT TO HIMSELF AND YET THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER MISERY OF THIS KING OF MAN
3723-171631-0015 THE HEART WHICH IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO THE KINGS OF THIS WORLD GREAT MEN THAT THE VENOM AND POISON OF EVERY PESTILENTIAL DISEASE DIRECTS ITSELF TO THE HEART AFFECTS THAT PERNICIOUS AFFECTION
3723-171631-0016 AND THE MALIGNITY OF ILL MEN IS ALSO DIRECTED UPON THE GREATEST AND THE BEST AND NOT ONLY GREATNESS BUT GOODNESS LOSES THE VIGOUR OF BEING AN ANTIDOTE OR CORDIAL AGAINST IT
3723-171631-0017 AND AS THE NOBLEST AND MOST GENEROUS CORDIALS THAT NATURE OR ART AFFORD OR CAN PREPARE IF THEY BE OFTEN TAKEN AND MADE FAMILIAR BECOME NO CORDIALS NOR HAVE ANY EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION
3723-171631-0018 SO THE GREATEST CORDIAL OF THE HEART PATIENCE IF IT BE MUCH EXERCISED EXALTS THE VENOM AND THE MALIGNITY OF THE ENEMY AND THE MORE WE SUFFER THE MORE WE ARE INSULTED UPON WHEN GOD HAD MADE THIS EARTH OF NOTHING
3723-171631-0019 IT WAS BUT A LITTLE HELP THAT HE HAD TO MAKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS EARTH NOTHING CAN BE NEARER NOTHING THAN THIS EARTH AND YET HOW LITTLE OF THIS EARTH IS THE GREATEST MAN HE THINKS HE TREADS UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0020 THAT ALL IS UNDER HIS FEET AND THE BRAIN THAT THINKS SO IS BUT EARTH HIS HIGHEST REGION THE FLESH THAT COVERS THAT IS BUT EARTH AND EVEN THE TOP OF THAT
3723-171631-0021 IS BUT A BUSH GROWING UPON THAT TURF OF EARTH HOW LITTLE OF THE WORLD IS THE EARTH AND YET THAT IS ALL THAT MAN HATH OR IS HOW LITTLE OF A MAN IS THE HEART AND YET IT IS ALL BY WHICH HE IS
3723-171631-0022 IF BEFORE HE HAD A BEING HE COULD HAVE SENSE OF THIS MISERY WOULD BUY A BEING HERE UPON THESE CONDITIONS ELEVEN EXPOSTULATION MY GOD MY GOD
3723-171631-0023 ALL THAT THOU ASKEST OF ME IS MY HEART MY SON GIVE ME THY HEART
3723-171631-0024 AS LONG AS I HAVE BUT MY HEART WILT THOU GIVE ME AN INHERITANCE A FILIATION ANY THING FOR MY HEART
3723-171631-0025 HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT JOB THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0026 SHALL MY FEAR SHALL MY ZEAL SHALL MY JEALOUSY HAVE LEAVE TO SAY TO THEE HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY HEART THAT THERE IS NOT SO PERVERSE A HEART UPON EARTH
3723-171631-0027 AND WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT AND SHALL I BE THY SON
3723-171631-0028 FOR GIVING THAT THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY WICKED WHO CAN KNOW IT
3723-171631-0029 THOU HAST SEARCHED SINCE AND FOUND ALL THESE GRADATIONS IN THE ILL OF OUR HEARTS THAT EVERY IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF OUR HEARTS IS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY
3723-171631-0030 AND WOULDST THOU HAVE MY HEART O GOD OF ALL LIGHT I KNOW THOU KNOWEST ALL AND IT IS THOU
3723-171631-0031 WITHOUT THEE O SOVEREIGN GOODNESS I COULD NOT KNOW HOW ILL MY HEART WERE THOU HAST DECLARED UNTO ME IN THY WORD THAT FOR ALL THIS DELUGE OF EVIL THAT HATH SURROUNDED ALL HEARTS
3723-171631-0032 YET THOU SOUGHTEST AND FOUNDEST A MAN AFTER THINE OWN HEART
3723-171631-0033 AND I CAN GATHER OUT OF THY WORD SO GOOD TESTIMONY OF THE HEARTS OF MEN AS TO FIND SINGLE HEARTS DOCILE AND APPREHENSIVE HEARTS HEARTS THAT CAN HEARTS THAT HAVE LEARNED
3723-171631-0034 WISE HEARTS IN ONE PLACE AND IN ANOTHER IN A GREAT DEGREE WISE PERFECT HEARTS STRAIGHT HEARTS NO PERVERSENESS WITHOUT AND CLEAN HEARTS NO FOULNESS WITHIN
3723-171631-0035 A HEAVINESS AND DEJECTION OF SPIRIT UPON HIM I HAVE FOUND THESE HEARTS AND A WORSE THAN THESE
3723-171631-0036 THE LAST ARE NOT HEARTS TO BE GIVEN TO THEE WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT THAT PRESENT I CANNOT BE THY SON AND I HAVE IT NOT TO THOSE OF THE FIRST KIND THOU GIVEST JOYFULNESS OF HEART
3723-171631-0037 AND I HAVE NOT THAT TO THOSE OF THE OTHER KIND THOU GIVEST FAINTNESS OF HEART
3723-171631-0038 IF YOU RETURN TO THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEARTS PREPARE YOUR HEARTS UNTO THE LORD
3723-171631-0039 IT IS A RETURNING HEART AND IF THOU SEE IT UPON THE WAY THOU WILT CARRY IT HOME NAY THE PREPARATION IS THINE TOO THIS MELTING THIS WOUNDING THIS BREAKING
3723-171631-0040 THIS CONTRITION WHICH I HAVE NOW IS THY WAY TO THY END AND THOSE DISCOMFORTS ARE FOR ALL THAT THE EARNEST OF THY SPIRIT IN MY HEART
3723-171631-0041 AND I HAVE HAD SOME DIFFIDENCE UPON THAT AND THOU HAST CLEARED A MORNING TO ME AGAIN AND MY HEART IS ALIVE DAVID'S HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE CUT OFF THE SKIRT FROM SAUL
3723-171631-0042 AND HIS HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE HAD NUMBERED HIS PEOPLE
3723-171631-0043 WHEN I COME TO NUMBER MY SINS BUT THAT BLOW IS NOT TO DEATH BECAUSE THOSE SINS ARE NOT TO DEATH BUT MY HEART LIVES IN THEE BUT YET AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS GREAT HOSPITAL
3723-171631-0044 THIS SICK THIS DISEASEFUL WORLD AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS LEPROUS HOUSE THIS FLESH OF MINE THIS HEART THOUGH THUS PREPARED FOR THEE PREPARED BY THEE
3723-171631-0045 WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE INVASION OF MALIGN AND PESTILENT VAPOURS BUT I HAVE MY CORDIALS IN THY PROMISE WHEN I SHALL KNOW THE PLAGUE OF MY HEART AND PRAY UNTO THEE IN THY HOUSE
3723-171631-0046 AND THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDINGS SHALL KEEP MY HEART AND MIND THROUGH CHRIST JESUS
3723-171631-0047 THOUGH THOU FILLEST ALL YET ART OTHERWISE IN SOME ROOMS THEREOF THAN IN OTHERS OTHERWISE IN THY CHURCH THAN IN MY CHAMBER AND OTHERWISE IN THY SACRAMENTS THAN IN MY PRAYERS
3723-171631-0048 SO THOUGH THOU BE ALWAYS PRESENT AND ALWAYS WORKING IN EVERY ROOM OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY YET I HUMBLY BESEECH THEE TO MANIFEST ALWAYS A MORE EFFECTUAL PRESENCE IN MY HEART
3723-171631-0049 THAN IN THE OTHER OFFICES INTO THE HOUSE OF THINE ANOINTED DISLOYAL PERSONS TRAITORS WILL COME INTO THY HOUSE THE CHURCH HYPOCRITES AND IDOLATORS WILL COME INTO SOME ROOMS OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY
3723-171631-0050 TEMPTATIONS WILL COME INFECTIONS WILL COME BUT BE MY HEART THY BEDCHAMBER O MY GOD AND THITHER LET THEM NOT ENTER JOB MADE A COVENANT WITH HIS EYES BUT NOT HIS MAKING OF THAT COVENANT
3723-171631-0051 BUT THY DWELLING IN HIS HEART ENABLED HIM TO KEEP THAT COVENANT THY SON HIMSELF HAD A SADNESS IN HIS SOUL TO DEATH AND HE HAD A RELUCTATION A DEPRECATION OF DEATH IN THE APPROACHES THEREOF
3723-171631-0052 BUT HE HAD HIS CORDIAL TOO YET NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE AND AS THOU HAST NOT DELIVERED US THINE ADOPTED SONS FROM THESE INFECTIOUS TEMPTATIONS
3723-171631-0053 SO NEITHER HAST THOU DELIVERED US OVER TO THEM NOR WITHHELD THY CORDIALS FROM US I WAS BAPTIZED IN THY CORDIAL WATER AGAINST ORIGINAL SIN AND I HAVE DRUNK OF THY CORDIAL BLOOD
3723-171631-0054 FOR MY RECOVERY FROM ACTUAL AND HABITUAL SIN IN THE OTHER SACRAMENT THOU O LORD WHO HAST IMPRINTED ALL MEDICINAL VIRTUES WHICH ARE IN ALL CREATURES AND HAST MADE EVEN THE FLESH OF VIPERS TO ASSIST IN CORDIALS
3723-171631-0055 ART ABLE TO MAKE THIS PRESENT SICKNESS EVERLASTING HEALTH THIS WEAKNESS EVERLASTING STRENGTH AND THIS VERY DEJECTION AND FAINTNESS OF HEART A POWERFUL CORDIAL
3723-171631-0056 MY GOD MY GOD WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME THOU DIDST REACH OUT THY HAND TO HIM BUT NOT TO DELIVER HIS SAD SOUL BUT TO RECEIVE HIS HOLY SOUL
3723-171631-0057 NEITHER DID HE LONGER DESIRE TO HOLD IT OF THEE BUT TO RECOMMEND IT TO THEE I SEE THINE HAND UPON ME NOW O LORD AND I ASK NOT WHY IT COMES WHAT IT INTENDS
3723-171631-0058 OR BID IT MEET THEE THIS DAY IN PARADISE I ASK NOT NOT IN A WISH NOT IN A THOUGHT INFIRMITY OF NATURE CURIOSITY OF MIND ARE TEMPTATIONS THAT OFFER
3723-171631-0059 BUT A SILENT AND ABSOLUTE OBEDIENCE TO THY WILL EVEN BEFORE I KNOW IT IS MY CORDIAL PRESERVE THAT TO ME O MY GOD AND THAT WILL PRESERVE ME TO THEE
3723-171631-0060 THAT WHEN THOU HAST CATECHISED ME WITH AFFLICTION HERE I MAY TAKE A GREATER DEGREE AND SERVE THEE IN A HIGHER PLACE IN THY KINGDOM OF JOY AND GLORY
8051-295385-0000 AND HIS GALLANT ACHIEVEMENTS ON THE DELAWARE CHAPTER ONE HITHERTO MOST VENERABLE AND COURTEOUS READER HAVE I SHOWN THEE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE VALOROUS STUYVESANT UNDER THE MILD MOONSHINE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0001 OR RATHER THE GRIM TRANQUILLITY OF AWFUL EXPECTATION BUT NOW THE WAR DRUM RUMBLES FROM AFAR THE BRAZEN TRUMPET BRAYS ITS THRILLING NOTE
8051-295385-0002 AND THE RUDE CLASH OF HOSTILE ARMS SPEAKS FEARFUL PROPHECIES OF COMING TROUBLES THE GALLANT WARRIOR STARTS FROM SOFT REPOSE FROM GOLDEN VISIONS AND VOLUPTUOUS EASE WHERE IN THE DULCET PIPING TIME OF PEACE
8051-295385-0003 NOR THROUGH THE LIVELONG LAZY SUMMER'S DAY CHANTS FORTH HIS LOVE SICK SOUL IN MADRIGALS TO MANHOOD ROUSED HE SPURNS THE AMOROUS FLUTE DOFFS FROM HIS BRAWNY BACK THE ROBE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0004 AND CLOTHES HIS PAMPERED LIMBS IN PANOPLY OF STEEL O'ER HIS DARK BROW WHERE LATE THE MYRTLE WAVED WHERE WANTON ROSES BREATHED ENERVATE LOVE HE REARS THE BEAMING CASQUE AND NODDING PLUME GRASPS THE BRIGHT SHIELD
8051-295385-0005 EXISTED IN THE CITY OF NEW AMSTERDAM THIS IS BUT A LOFTY AND GIGANTIC MODE IN WHICH WE HEROIC WRITERS ALWAYS TALK OF WAR THEREBY TO GIVE IT A NOBLE AND IMPOSING ASPECT
8051-295385-0006 EQUIPPING OUR WARRIORS WITH BUCKLERS HELMS AND LANCES AND SUCH LIKE OUTLANDISH AND OBSOLETE WEAPONS THE LIKE OF WHICH PERCHANCE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF IN THE SAME MANNER THAT A CUNNING STATUARY ARRAYS A MODERN GENERAL OR AN ADMIRAL
8051-295385-0007 IN THE ACCOUTREMENTS OF A CAESAR OR AN ALEXANDER THE SIMPLE TRUTH THEN OF ALL THIS ORATORICAL FLOURISH IS THIS THAT THE VALIANT PETER STUYVESANT ALL OF A SUDDEN FOUND IT NECESSARY
8051-295385-0008 AND PREPARE HIMSELF TO UNDERGO THOSE HARDY TOILS OF WAR IN WHICH HIS MIGHTY SOUL SO MUCH DELIGHTED METHINKS I AT THIS MOMENT BEHOLD HIM IN MY IMAGINATION OR RATHER I BEHOLD HIS GOODLY PORTRAIT
8051-295385-0009 WHICH STILL HANGS IN THE FAMILY MANSION OF THE STUYVESANTS ARRAYED IN ALL THE TERRORS OF A TRUE DUTCH GENERAL HIS REGIMENTAL COAT OF GERMAN BLUE GORGEOUSLY DECORATED WITH A GOODLY SHOW OF LARGE BRASS BUTTONS
8051-295385-0010 REACHING FROM HIS WAISTBAND TO HIS CHIN THE VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS TURNED UP AT THE CORNERS AND SEPARATING GALLANTLY BEHIND SO AS TO DISPLAY THE SEAT OF A SUMPTUOUS PAIR OF BRIMSTONE COLORED TRUNK BREECHES
8051-295385-0011 A GRACEFUL STYLE STILL PREVALENT AMONG THE WARRIORS OF OUR DAY AND WHICH IS IN CONFORMITY TO THE CUSTOM OF ANCIENT HEROES WHO SCORNED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN REAR
8051-295385-0012 STUCK WITH A GALLANT AND FIERY AIR OVER HIS LEFT EYE SUCH WAS THE CHIVALRIC PORT OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG AND WHEN HE MADE A SUDDEN HALT PLANTED HIMSELF FIRMLY ON HIS SOLID SUPPORTER
8051-295385-0013 WITH HIS WOODEN LEG INLAID WITH SILVER A LITTLE IN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING A GOLD HEADED CANE HIS LEFT RESTING UPON THE PUMMEL OF HIS SWORD HIS HEAD DRESSING SPIRITEDLY TO THE RIGHT
8051-295385-0014 WITH A MOST APPALLING AND HARD FAVORED FROWN UPON HIS BROW HE PRESENTED ALTOGETHER ONE OF THE MOST COMMANDING BITTER LOOKING AND SOLDIER LIKE FIGURES THAT EVER STRUTTED UPON CANVAS
8051-295385-0015 PROCEED WE NOW TO INQUIRE THE CAUSE OF THIS WARLIKE PREPARATION IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE FOUNDING OF FORT CASIMIR AND OF THE MERCILESS WARFARE WAGED BY ITS COMMANDER
8051-295385-0016 UPON CABBAGES SUNFLOWERS AND PUMPKINS FOR WANT OF BETTER OCCASION TO FLESH HIS SWORD NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HIGHER UP THE DELAWARE AT HIS STRONGHOLD OF TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0017 WHO STYLED HIMSELF GOVERNOR OF NEW SWEDEN IF HISTORY BELIE NOT THIS REDOUBTABLE SWEDE HE WAS A RIVAL WORTHY OF THE WINDY AND INFLATED COMMANDER OF FORT CASIMIR FOR MASTER DAVID PIETERZEN DE VRIE IN HIS EXCELLENT BOOK OF VOYAGES
8051-295385-0018 DESCRIBES HIM AS WEIGHING UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS A HUGE FEEDER AND BOUSER IN PROPORTION TAKING THREE POTATIONS POTTLE DEEP AT EVERY MEAL HE HAD A GARRISON AFTER HIS OWN HEART AT TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0019 GUZZLING DEEP DRINKING SWASHBUCKLERS WHO MADE THE WILD WOODS RING WITH THEIR CAROUSALS NO SOONER DID THIS ROBUSTIOUS COMMANDER HEAR OF THE ERECTION OF FORT CASIMIR THAN HE SENT A MESSAGE TO VAN POFFENBURGH
8051-295385-0020 WARNING HIM OFF THE LAND AS BEING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF HIS JURISDICTION TO THIS GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH REPLIED THAT THE LAND BELONGED TO THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES HAVING BEEN REGULARLY PURCHASED OF THE NATIVES AS DISCOVERERS
8051-295385-0021 FROM THE MANHATTOES AS WITNESS THE BREECHES OF THEIR LAND MEASURER TEN BROECK TO THIS THE GOVERNOR REJOINED THAT THE LAND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLD BY THE INDIANS TO THE SWEDES AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS UNDER THE PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT
8051-295385-0022 OF HER SWEDISH MAJESTY CHRISTINA AND WOE BE TO ANY MORTAL THAT WORE A BREECHES WHO SHOULD DARE TO MEDDLE EVEN WITH THE HEM OF HER SACRED GARMENT
8051-295385-0023 I FORBEAR TO DILATE UPON THE WAR OF WORDS WHICH WAS KEPT UP FOR SOME TIME BY THESE WINDY COMMANDERS VAN POFFENBURGH HOWEVER HAD SERVED UNDER WILLIAM THE TESTY AND WAS A VETERAN IN THIS KIND OF WARFARE
8051-295385-0024 GOVERNOR PRINTZ FINDING HE WAS NOT TO BE DISLODGED BY THESE LONG SHOTS NOW DETERMINED UPON COMING TO CLOSER QUARTERS ACCORDINGLY HE DESCENDED THE RIVER IN GREAT FORCE AND FUME AND ERECTED A RIVAL FORTRESS
8051-295385-0025 JUST ONE SWEDISH MILE BELOW FORT CASIMIR TO WHICH HE GAVE THE NAME OF HELSENBURG AND NOW COMMENCED A TREMENDOUS RIVALRY BETWEEN THESE TWO DOUGHTY COMMANDERS STRIVING TO OUTSTRUT AND OUTSWELL EACH OTHER
8051-295385-0026 LIKE A COUPLE OF BELLIGERENT TURKEY COCKS THERE WAS A CONTEST WHO SHOULD RUN UP THE TALLEST FLAG STAFF AND DISPLAY THE BROADEST FLAG ALL DAY LONG THERE WAS A FURIOUS ROLLING OF DRUMS AND TWANGING OF TRUMPETS IN EITHER FORTRESS
8051-295385-0027 AND WHICHEVER HAD THE WIND IN ITS FAVOR WOULD KEEP UP A CONTINUAL FIRING OF CANNON TO TAUNT ITS ANTAGONIST WITH THE SMELL OF GUNPOWDER ON ALL THESE POINTS OF WINDY WARFARE THE ANTAGONISTS WERE WELL MATCHED
8051-295385-0028 BUT SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE SWEDISH FORTRESS BEING LOWER DOWN THE RIVER ALL THE DUTCH VESSELS BOUND TO FORT CASIMIR WITH SUPPLIES HAD TO PASS IT
8051-295385-0029 GOVERNOR PRINTZ AT ONCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND COMPELLED THEM TO LOWER THEIR FLAGS AS THEY PASSED UNDER THE GUNS OF HIS BATTERY THIS WAS A DEADLY WOUND TO THE DUTCH PRIDE OF GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH
8051-295385-0030 AND SORELY WOULD HE SWELL WHEN FROM THE RAMPARTS OF FORT CASIMIR HE BEHELD THE FLAG OF THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES STRUCK TO THE RIVAL FORTRESS TO HEIGHTEN HIS VEXATION GOVERNOR PRINTZ WHO AS HAS BEEN SHOWN WAS A HUGE TRENCHERMAN
8051-295385-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE HE MAY HAVE PAID TO THE DUTCH SKIPPERS THE FULL VALUE OF THEIR COMMODITIES BUT WHAT CONSOLATION WAS THIS TO JACOBUS VAN POFFENBURGH AND HIS GARRISON WHO THUS FOUND THEIR FAVORITE SUPPLIES CUT OFF
8051-295385-0032 AND DIVERTED INTO THE LARDERS OF THE HOSTILE CAMPS FOR SOME TIME THIS WAR OF THE CUPBOARD WAS CARRIED ON TO THE GREAT FESTIVITY AND JOLLIFICATION OF THE SWEDES WHILE THE WARRIORS OF FORT CASIMIR FOUND THEIR HEARTS OR RATHER THEIR STOMACHS
8051-295385-0033 DAILY FAILING THEM AT LENGTH THE SUMMER HEATS AND SUMMER SHOWERS SET IN AND NOW LO AND BEHOLD A GREAT MIRACLE WAS WROUGHT FOR THE RELIEF OF THE NEDERLANDS
8051-295385-0034 FOR IT CAME TO PASS THAT A GREAT CLOUD OF MOSQUITOS AROSE OUT OF THE MARSHY BORDERS OF THE RIVER AND SETTLED UPON THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG BEING DOUBTLESS ATTRACTED BY THE SCENT OF THE FRESH BLOOD OF THE SWEDISH GORMANDISERS
8051-295385-0035 NAY IT IS SAID THAT THE BODY OF JAN PRINTZ ALONE
8051-295385-0036 WAS SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT THE MOSQUITO FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME THE GARRISON ENDEAVORED TO HOLD OUT BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN THE MOSQUITOS PENETRATED INTO EVERY CHINK AND CREVICE AND GAVE THEM NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT
8051-295385-0037 SUCH WAS THE FAMOUS MOSQUITO WAR ON THE DELAWARE OF WHICH GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN THE HERO BUT THE DEVOUT PEOPLE OF THE NIEUW NEDERLANDS ALWAYS ASCRIBED THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SWEDES
8051-295385-0038 TO THE MIRACULOUS INTERVENTION OF SAINT NICHOLAS AS TO THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG IT FELL TO RUIN
8051-119902-0000 CHAPTER THREE WAR BREAD BREAD IS THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR ALL NATIONS BUT BREAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE WHEAT LOAF AT ONE TIME AND PLACE IT HAS BEEN BARLEY CAKE
8051-119902-0001 AT ANOTHER OATEN CAKE AND AT ANOTHER CORN PONE BREAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHATEVER CEREAL HAPPENED TO BE CONVENIENT EVEN SUCH UNBREADLIKE FOOD AS RICE IS TO SOME RACES WHAT BREAD IS TO US
8051-119902-0002 WHY THEN HAVE WE DEVELOPED OUR WHEAT BREAD HABIT PARTLY BECAUSE WHEAT BREAD HAS BEEN EASY TO GET AND WE HAVE GROWN TO LIKE THE TASTE BUT CHIEFLY BECAUSE WHEAT FLOUR GIVES THE LIGHTEST LOAF
8051-119902-0003 TO UNDERSTAND WHY MAKE A DOUGH WITH A LITTLE WHITE FLOUR AND WATER AND THEN GENTLY KNEAD IT IN COLD WATER THE CONSISTENCY CHANGES THE STARCH IS WASHED OUT AND A RUBBERY STICKY BALL IS LEFT
8051-119902-0004 THE GLUTEN WHICH IS THE PROTEIN OF THE WHEAT IT IS THIS GLUTEN IN THE FLOUR THAT STRETCHES WHEN BREAD RISES AND THEN STIFFENS WHEN IT IS BAKED MAKING A LIGHT POROUS LOAF
8051-119902-0005 WHEAT IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE CEREALS THAT HAS MUCH GLUTEN RYE HAS A LITTLE AND THE OTHERS PRACTICALLY NONE GLUTEN SEEMS TO BE ESSENTIAL TO THE MAKING OF A LIGHT YEAST RAISED LOAF
8051-119902-0006 PRODUCTS RAISED WITH BAKING POWDER FOR WHICH OUR STANDARD OF LIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT QUICK BREADS LIKE BISCUITS AND MUFFINS AND CAKES DO NOT REQUIRE THE GLUTEN AND CAN EASILY BE MADE FROM SUBSTITUTE CEREALS
8051-119902-0007 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PRODUCE A WHEATLESS LOAF WHICH IS LIGHT PALATABLE AND SUFFICIENTLY DURABLE TO STAND TRANSPORTATION THE DURABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION CRUMBLY CORN BREAD CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED BY BAKERS NOR SERVED TO ARMIES
8051-119902-0008 THE BAKERS REGULATIONS VICTORY BREAD THE BAKERS HAVE CO OPERATED LOYALLY PROBABLY NO OTHER FOOD INDUSTRY HAS BEEN MORE VITALLY AFFECTED BY THE WAR
8051-119902-0009 ALL BAKERS USING THREE OR MORE BARRELS OF FLOUR A MONTH HAVE BEEN LICENSED AND SO ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION THIS MEANS PRACTICALLY ALL THE COMMERCIAL BAKERS OF THE COUNTRY
8051-119902-0010 AND MANY HOTELS CLUBS AND INSTITUTIONS ABOUT TWO FIFTHS OF THE BREAD IN THE UNITED STATES IS MADE IN BAKERIES AND THREE FIFTHS IN THE HOME THE BAKERIES HAVE USED THIRTY FIVE MILLION BARRELS OF FLOUR EACH YEAR
8051-119902-0011 OR IF THEY ARE PASTRY AND CRACKER BAKERS SEVENTY PER CENT THEY MUST MAKE NO BREAD WHOLLY OF WHEAT FLOUR SOME SUBSTITUTE MUST BE MIXED WITH THE WHEAT WHEN THE REGULATION WENT INTO EFFECT IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
8051-119902-0012 TWENTY PER CENT WAS REQUIRED AND LATER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN PIES AND CAKES THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE THIRD SUBSTITUTE THE AMOUNTS OF SUGAR AND FAT USED ARE LIMITED
8051-119902-0013 EVEN THE SIZES OF THE LOAVES ARE FIXED SO THAT THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF MAKING AND HANDLING ALL SORTS OF FANCY SHAPES AND SIZES MAY BE AVOIDED BREAD MUST NOT BE SOLD TO THE RETAILER AT UNREASONABLE PRICES
8051-119902-0014 VICTORY BREAD IS BREAD MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS THE NAME VICTORY WAS CHOSEN AS REPRESENTING THE IDEA UNDERLYING THE CONSERVATION OF WHEAT
8051-119902-0015 THE NAME IS REALLY A PRESENT TO THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION HAVING BEEN USED BY TWO LARGE FIRMS WHO GAVE UP ALL RIGHTS TO THEIR TRADE MARK
8051-119902-0016 HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE OR SERVE BREAD CONTAINING AT LEAST AS MUCH OF THE WHEAT SUBSTITUTES AS VICTORY BREAD THEY MAY NOT SERVE MORE THAN TWO OUNCES OF BREAD AND OTHER WHEAT PRODUCTS TO A GUEST AT A MEAL
8051-119902-0017 THAT MEANS OF COURSE THAT ONLY THROUGH INTELLIGENT EFFORT CAN THEY SERVE YEAST BREAD
8051-119902-0018 UNTIL THE WHEAT SUPPLY INCREASES AND THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION LESSENS RESTRICTIONS USE NO WHEAT AT ALL IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN MAKE DELICIOUS MUFFINS AND OTHER QUICK BREADS FROM THE SUBSTITUTE FLOURS
8051-119902-0019 AND YOU NEED NO BREAD AT ALL AT SOME MEALS AN EXTRA POTATO OR A SERVING OF RICE CAN BE EATEN INSTEAD OF THE USUAL TWO SLICES OF BREAD AND THE BODY WILL BE SUPPLIED WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY DO NOT BE THE SLAVE OF OLD FOOD HABITS
8051-119902-0020 WHEN ALL EUROPE IS EATING TO KEEP ALIVE FASTIDIOUSNESS AND FOOD NOTIONS MUST PLAY NO PART IN THE DIETARY
8051-119902-0021 HUNDREDS IN CROWDED CITY QUARTERS HAVE NO FACILITIES OF THEIR OWN FOR BAKING WOMEN DOING THEIR SHARE IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS CANNOT GET UP EARLIER TO MAKE CORN BREAD FOR BREAKFAST VICTORY BREAD MUST BE SAVED FOR THEM
8051-119902-0022 FOR HOUSEHOLDS WHICH MUST USE WHEAT
8051-119902-0023 THIS INCLUDES WHEAT IN THE FORM OF BREAD PASTRY MACARONI CRACKERS NOODLES AND BREAKFAST FOODS
8051-119902-0024 THE INTERESTS AND DESIRES OF EACH OF US IN THIS WAR CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO SERVICE IN NO MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THAN BY CONFORMING OUR FOOD HABITS TO THE NEEDS OF THE HOUR FLOUR AND BREAD IN THE ALLIED COUNTRIES
8051-119902-0025 IN ENGLAND THERE ARE LOCAL REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF MASHED POTATO IN BREAD THEIR BREAD MUST BE TWELVE HOURS OLD BEFORE IT IS SOLD SO THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO EAT TOO MUCH THE RESULT IS SELDOM PALATABLE
8051-119902-0026 IN FRANCE NO FLOUR AT ALL MAY BE USED TO MAKE THE DELECTABLE PASTRIES AND CAKES WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN THE DELIGHT OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE AND THEIR GUESTS IN ITALY
8051-119902-0027 MUST CONTAIN FORTY THREE PER CENT SUBSTITUTE AND IN SOME PLACES MAY NOT BE MANUFACTURED AT ALL BOTH ENGLAND AND FRANCE HAVE SUBSIDIZED BREAD THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET A PRICE BELOW COST
8051-119902-0028 AND ITSELF MAKES UP THE DIFFERENCE TO THE BAKER ENGLAND HAS APPROPRIATED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PURPOSE BREAD RATIONS ARE IN FORCE IN BOTH FRANCE AND ITALY
8051-119902-0029 FRANCE HAS RECENTLY PUT HER WHOLE PEOPLE ON A RIGOROUS RATION WHICH LIMITS THEM TO TWO THIRDS OF THE AMOUNT OF BREAD THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO REMEMBER THAT BREAD IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT PART OF THE FRENCH DIET THAN OF OURS
8051-119902-0030 RATIONS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE AMOUNT MENTIONED WILL BE FORTHCOMING THEY ONLY PERMIT ONE TO HAVE IT IF IT CAN BE OBTAINED
8051-119902-0031 THE VOLUNTARY RATION ALLOWS ONE HALF POUND OF BREAD A DAY FOR SEDENTARY AND UNOCCUPIED WOMEN AND LARGER ALLOWANCES UP TO A LITTLE OVER A POUND FOR MEN DOING HEAVY LABOR
8051-119902-0032 WASTE OF ANY KIND IS VERY HEAVILY PUNISHED ONE WOMAN WAS FINED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THROWING AWAY STALE BREAD WHY NOT SEND CORN ABROAD
8051-119902-0033 THE ANSWERS ARE MANY IN THE FIRST PLACE WE ARE SENDING CORN OVER OUR EXPORTS OF CORN DURING MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INCREASED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT AND OF CORN MEAL THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE PER CENT
8051-119902-0034 OVER THE PRE WAR AVERAGE THIS THEY ARE USING AS WE ARE USING IT IN OUR VICTORY BREAD BUT THEY MUST HAVE ENOUGH WHEAT TO MAKE A DURABLE LOAF OF BREAD AT THE BAKESHOPS WHERE FOR GENERATIONS ALL THE BAKING HAS BEEN DONE
8051-119902-0035 AND THE EXTRA UNACCUSTOMED LABOR OF BREAD MAKING CANNOT BE ADDED TO HER BURDENS WHY WE IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT HAVE BREAD CARDS SOME PEOPLE DISTURBED EITHER SELFISHLY OR PATRIOTICALLY
8051-119902-0036 BY THE FAILURE OF A NEIGHBOR TO CONSERVE WHEAT HAVE ASKED WHY THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION TRUSTS TO VOLUNTARY METHODS WHY IT DOES NOT RATION THE COUNTRY RATIONING MAY COME YET BUT ANY SUCH SYSTEM BRISTLES WITH DIFFICULTIES
8051-119902-0037 THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED ALL THE WAY FROM TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED IN THEIR CONSUMPTION BY RATIONING
8051-119902-0038 BUT ON THOSE WITH LITTLE TO SPEND WHO MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR WHOLE FOOD HABITS THE SUCCESS THAT IS MEETING OUR METHOD OF VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF CONSUMPTION
2289-152258-0000 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ASIA AND AFRICA AND MUCH OF THOSE IN TURKEY IN EUROPE PROFESS THE MO HAM'ME DAN RELIGION THEY ARE CALLED MOHAMMEDANS MUS'SUL MANS OR MOSLEMS
2289-152258-0001 AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
2289-152258-0002 A CITY OF ARABIA HIS PARENTS WERE POOR PEOPLE THOUGH IT IS SAID THEY WERE DESCENDED FROM ARABIAN PRINCES THEY DIED WHEN MOHAMMED WAS A CHILD
2289-152258-0003 AND BROUGHT HIM UP WHEN THE BOY GREW OLD ENOUGH HE TOOK CARE OF HIS UNCLE'S SHEEP AND CAMELS SOMETIMES HE WENT ON JOURNEYS WITH HIS UNCLE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF ARABIA TO HELP HIM IN HIS BUSINESS AS A TRADER ON THESE JOURNEYS MOHAMMED USED TO RIDE ON A CAMEL
2289-152258-0004 AND HE SOON BECAME A SKILLFUL CAMEL DRIVER MOHAMMED WAS VERY FAITHFUL AND HONEST IN ALL HIS WORK HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND NEVER BROKE A PROMISE I HAVE GIVEN MY PROMISE HE WOULD SAY AND I MUST KEEP IT
2289-152258-0005 THAT PEOPLE GAVE HIM THE NAME OF EL AMIN WHICH MEANS THE TRUTHFUL AT THIS TIME HE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT THE RICH TRADERS HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM THAT THEY GAVE HIM IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AND TRUSTED HIM WITH LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
2289-152258-0006 AND SOLD THERE THE GOODS CARRIED BY THE CAMELS
2289-152258-0007 AND FAITHFULLY PAID OVER TO THE OWNERS OF THE GOODS THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED MOHAMMED HAD NO SCHOOL EDUCATION HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE BUT HE WAS NOT IGNORANT HE KNEW WELL HOW TO DO THE WORK INTRUSTED TO HIM AND
2289-152258-0008 THIS WOMAN WAS A WIDOW WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CAMEL DRIVER SAW MOHAMMED HE STOPPED HIM AND SAID MY MISTRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOON I THINK SHE INTENDS TO ENGAGE YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER CARAVANS
2289-152258-0009 AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF KHADIJAH FOR HE WAS WELL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING EMPLOYED IN SO IMPORTANT A SERVICE
2289-152258-0010 SHE SAID I HAVE HEARD MUCH OF YOU AMONG THE TRADERS
2289-152258-0011 ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE CHARGE OF MY CARAVANS AND GIVE YOUR WHOLE TIME AND SERVICE TO ME MOHAMMED WAS DELIGHTED
2289-152258-0012 KHADIJAH THEN ENGAGED HIM AS THE MANAGER OF HER BUSINESS AND HE SERVED HER WELL AND FAITHFULLY SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HIM
2289-152258-0013 AND SOON THEY CAME TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WERE MARRIED AS HE WAS NOW THE HUSBAND OF A RICH WOMAN HE DID NOT NEED TO WORK VERY HARD HE STILL CONTINUED TO ATTEND TO HIS WIFE'S BUSINESS BUT HE DID NOT MAKE SO MANY JOURNEYS AS BEFORE
2289-152258-0014 AND CHRISTIANITY BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER OF THEM
2289-152258-0015 WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
2289-152258-0016 IN A CAVE ON MOUNT HIRA NEAR MECCA HE SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS EVERY YEAR IN PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS MEDITATION HE DECLARED THAT WHILE PRAYING IN HIS CAVE HE OFTEN HAD VISIONS OF GOD AND HEAVEN
2289-152258-0017 HE SAID THAT MANY TIMES THE ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARED TO HIM AND REVEALED TO HIM THE RELIGION WHICH HE AFTERWARDS TAUGHT HIS FOLLOWERS AS HE HIMSELF COULD NOT WRITE HE COMMITTED TO MEMORY ALL THAT THE ANGEL TOLD HIM AND HAD IT WRITTEN IN A BOOK
2289-152258-0018 THIS BOOK IS CALLED THE KORAN WHICH MEANS LIKE OUR OWN WORD BIBLE THE BOOK
2289-152258-0019 THREE WHEN MOHAMMED RETURNED HOME AFTER THE ANGEL HAD FIRST SPOKEN TO HIM HE TOLD HIS WIFE OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD SHE AT ONCE BELIEVED AND SO BECAME A CONVERT TO THE NEW RELIGION
2289-152258-0020 SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AT THE FEET OF HER HUSBAND AND CRIED OUT THERE IS BUT ONE GOD MOHAMMED IS GOD'S PROPHET MOHAMMED THEN TOLD THE STORY TO OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY SOME OF THEM BELIEVED AND BECAME HIS FIRST FOLLOWERS
2289-152258-0021 SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
2289-152258-0022 LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
2289-152258-0023 HE WENT ON TELLING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF GABRIEL AND PREACHING THE DOCTRINES WHICH HE SAID THE ANGEL HAD ORDERED HIM TO TEACH THE PEOPLE
2289-152258-0024 AT SUCH TIMES HIS FACE GREW PALE AS DEATH HIS EYES BECAME RED AND STARING HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE AND HIS BODY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY THEN HE WOULD TELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN HIS VISION
2289-152258-0025 PEOPLE CAME FROM DISTANT PARTS OF ARABIA AND FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO HEAR HIM ONE DAY SIX OF THE CHIEF MEN OF ME DI'NA
2289-152258-0026 ABOUT THIS TIME MOHAMMED'S UNCLE AND WIFE DIED AND HE HAD THEN HARDLY ANY FRIENDS IN MECCA HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO LEAVE THAT CITY AND GO TO MEDINA NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE THERE BELIEVED HIS DOCTRINES
2289-152258-0027 AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
2289-152258-0028 THAT MOHAMMED FLED FROM MECCA THIS EVENT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MOHAMMEDAN HISTORY IT IS CALLED THE FLIGHT OF THE PROPHET OR THE HEJ'I RA
2289-152258-0029 THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE A SPLENDID CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR HIM IN MEDINA IT WAS CALLED A MOSQUE AND ALL MOHAMMEDAN CHURCHES OR PLACES OF WORSHIP
2289-152258-0030 HE GAINED MANY VICTORIES HE MARCHED AGAINST MECCA WITH AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN AND THE CITY SURRENDERED WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE THE PEOPLE THEN JOINED HIS RELIGION AND DESTROYED THEIR IDOLS
2289-152258-0031 HE WAS BURIED IN THE MOSQUE IN WHICH HE HAD HELD RELIGIOUS SERVICES FOR SO MANY YEARS
2289-152258-0032 THAT THE BODY STILL LIES IN THE COFFIN IN THE SAME STATE AS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BURIED
2289-152258-0033 THAT THE COFFIN OF MOHAMMED RESTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THIS FABLE WAS INVENTED BY ENEMIES TO BRING RIDICULE ON THE PROPHET AND HIS RELIGION
2289-152258-0034 EVERY MUSSULMAN IS BOUND BY HIS RELIGION TO MAKE A VISIT OR PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE
2289-152258-0035 OF THE MOSQUE AND CHANTING IN A LOUD VOICE SUCH WORDS AS THESE COME TO PRAYER COME TO PRAYER THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD HE GIVETH LIFE AND HE DIETH NOT I PRAISE HIS PERFECTION GOD IS GREAT IN MECCA
2289-152258-0036 THERE IS A MOSQUE CALLED THE GREAT MOSQUE IT IS A LARGE ENCLOSURE IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANGLE OR SQUARE
2289-152258-0037 IT ITS WALL AT ONE CORNER IS THE CELEBRATED BLACK STONE MOSLEMS REGARD THIS STONE WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE THEY SAY THAT IT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ONCE WHITE
2289-152258-0038 BUT HAS BECOME DARK FROM BEING WEPT UPON AND TOUCHED BY SO MANY MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS IT REALLY IS REDDISH BROWN IN COLOR BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED THE KA'A BA WAS A PAGAN TEMPLE
2289-152258-0039 BUT WHEN HE TOOK POSSESSION OF MECCA HE MADE THE OLD TEMPLE THE CENTRE OF WORSHIP FOR HIS OWN RELIGION AFTER MOHAMMED DIED A PERSON WAS APPOINTED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR AS HEAD OF THE MOSLEM CHURCH
2289-152258-0040 AND THIS TITLE HAS BEEN BORNE EVER SINCE BY THE RELIGIOUS CHIEF OF THE MOHAMMEDANS IN MODERN TIMES THE SULTANS OR RULERS OF TURKEY
2289-152254-0000 WHEN HE WAS BUT TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HE WAS LAME IN ONE LEG AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE A VERY ORDINARY PERSON LIKE MOST OF THE VANDALS HE WAS A CRUEL AND CUNNING MAN BUT HE HAD GREAT ABILITY IN MANY WAYS
2289-152254-0001 BUT A PLOT WAS FORMED AGAINST HIM
2289-152254-0002 AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST ROME AT THE SAME TIME HE WROTE SECRETLY TO COUNT BONIFACE AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE CAME TO ROME THE EMPRESS WOULD PUT HIM TO DEATH BONIFACE BELIEVED THIS STORY
2289-152254-0003 HE ALSO SENT A LETTER TO GENSERIC INVITING HIM TO COME TO AFRICA WITH AN ARMY GENSERIC WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE THE INVITATION FROM BONIFACE HE HAD LONG WANTED TO ATTACK ROME AND TAKE FROM HER SOME OF THE RICH COUNTRIES SHE HAD CONQUERED
2289-152254-0004 AND MARCHED INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE COAST AND CAPTURED TOWNS AND CITIES BY THIS TIME BONIFACE HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE WICKED PLOT OF AETIUS HE NOW REGRETTED HAVING INVITED THE VANDALS TO AFRICA AND TRIED TO INDUCE THEM TO RETURN TO SPAIN
2289-152254-0005 BUT GENSERIC STERNLY REFUSED NEVER HE SAID SHALL I GO BACK TO SPAIN UNTIL I AM MASTER OF AFRICA THEN CRIED BONIFACE I WILL DRIVE YOU BACK SOON AFTERWARDS THERE WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND VANDALS AND THE ROMANS WERE DEFEATED
2289-152254-0006 THEY WERE ALSO DEFEATED IN SEVERAL OTHER BATTLES AT LAST THEY HAD TO FLEE FOR SAFETY TO TWO OR THREE TOWNS WHICH THE VANDALS HAD NOT YET TAKEN ONE OF THESE TOWNS WAS HIPPO GENSERIC CAPTURED THIS TOWN
2289-152254-0007 DESTROYS VALUABLE PROPERTY A GREAT MANY OF THE NATIVES OF AFRICA JOINED THE ARMY OF GENSERIC THEY HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN ILL TREATED BY THE ROMANS AND WERE GLAD TO SEE THEM DEFEATED
2289-152254-0008 HE BUILT GREAT FLEETS AND SAILED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN CAPTURING TRADING VESSELS FOR MANY YEARS HE PLUNDERED TOWNS ALONG THE COASTS
2289-152254-0009 AFTER RULING SEVERAL YEARS VALENTINIAN HAD JUST BEEN MURDERED BY A ROMAN NOBLE NAMED MAXIMUS WHO HAD AT ONCE MADE HIMSELF EMPEROR WHEN THE MESSENGER ENTERED THE ROOM WHERE GENSERIC WAS HE SAID GREAT KING
2289-152254-0010 I BRING YOU A MESSAGE FROM THE EMPRESS EUDOXIA SHE BEGS YOUR HELP SHE AND HER TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS ARE IN DANGER IN ROME SHE WISHES YOU TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST MAXIMUS SHE INVITES YOU TO COME WITH AN ARMY TO ROME AND TAKE THE CITY
2289-152254-0011 SHE AND HER FRIENDS WILL HELP YOU AS MUCH AS THEY CAN WITH A CRY OF JOY GENSERIC SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND EXCLAIMED TELL THE EMPRESS THAT I ACCEPT HER INVITATION I SHALL SET OUT FOR ROME IMMEDIATELY
2289-152254-0012 I SHALL SET OUT FOR ROME IMMEDIATELY I SHALL PROTECT EUDOXIA AND HER FRIENDS GENSERIC THEN GOT READY A FLEET AND A GREAT ARMY AND SAILED ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN
2289-152254-0013 TO THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER WHEN THE EMPEROR MAXIMUS HEARD THAT THE VANDALS WERE COMING HE PREPARED TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AND HE ADVISED THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME THE PEOPLE WERE SO ANGRY AT THIS
2289-152254-0014 IT WAS ONLY FORTY FIVE YEARS SINCE ALARIC HAD BEEN THERE
2289-152254-0015 BUT SINCE THEN ROME HAD BECOME AGAIN GRAND AND WEALTHY SO THERE WAS PLENTY FOR GENSERIC AND HIS VANDALS TO CARRY AWAY THEY SPENT FOURTEEN DAYS IN THE WORK OF PLUNDER THEY SACKED THE TEMPLES
2289-152254-0016 AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND PRIVATE HOUSES
2289-152254-0017 SOME YEARS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF ROME BY GENSERIC THERE WAS A ROMAN EMPEROR NAMED MA JO'RI AN HE WAS A GOOD RULER AND A BRAVE MAN THE VANDALS STILL CONTINUED TO ATTACK AND PLUNDER CITIES IN ITALY
2289-152254-0018 AND OTHER COUNTRIES BELONGING TO ROME AND MAJORIAN RESOLVED TO PUNISH THEM SO HE GOT TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND BUILT A FLEET OF THREE HUNDRED SHIPS TO CARRY HIS TROOPS TO CARTHAGE
2289-152254-0019 BUT HE FIRST MARCHED HIS MEN ACROSS THE ALPS THROUGH GAUL AND DOWN TO THE SEAPORT OF CARTHAGENA IN SPAIN WHERE HIS FLEET WAS STATIONED HE TOOK THIS ROUTE BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO ADD TO HIS FORCES
2289-152254-0020 AS HE WENT ALONG BEFORE SAILING WITH HIS ARMY FOR CARTHAGE HE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE THE VANDALS WERE AND WHETHER THEY WERE SO POWERFUL AT HOME AS WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED
2289-152254-0021 AND ENTERTAINED HIM HOSPITABLY NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS THE EMPEROR MAJORIAN OF COURSE PEACE WAS NOT MADE THE EMPEROR LEFT CARTHAGE AFTER HAVING GOT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS HE COULD
2289-152254-0022 BUT GENSERIC DID NOT WAIT FOR THE ROMAN FLEET TO COME TO ATTACK HIM IN HIS CAPITAL WHEN HE GOT WORD THAT IT WAS IN THE BAY OF CARTHAGENA HE SAILED THERE WITH A FLEET OF HIS OWN AND IN A SINGLE DAY BURNED OR SANK NEARLY ALL THE ROMAN SHIPS
2289-152254-0023 AFTER THIS THE VANDALS BECAME MORE THAN EVER THE TERROR OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ALL THE COUNTRIES BORDERING UPON IT EVERY YEAR THEIR SHIPS WENT ROUND THE COASTS FROM ASIA MINOR TO SPAIN ATTACKING AND PLUNDERING CITIES ON THEIR WAY
2289-152254-0024 AND CARRYING OFF PRISONERS ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE ROMANS FAILED TO PUT A STOP TO THESE RAVAGES THE EMPEROR LEO WHO RULED OVER THE EASTERN DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE FITTED OUT A GREAT FLEET AT CONSTANTINOPLE
2289-152254-0025 TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS THE PIRATES THERE WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND SHIPS IN THIS FLEET AND THEY CARRIED A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN
2289-152254-0026 THE BROTHER OF EMPEROR LEO'S WIFE BASILICUS SAILED WITH HIS SHIPS TO AFRICA AND LANDED THE ARMY NOT FAR FROM CARTHAGE GENSERIC ASKED FOR A TRUCE FOR FIVE DAYS TO CONSIDER TERMS OF PEACE AND THE TRUCE WAS GRANTED
2289-152254-0027 BUT THE CUNNING VANDAL WAS NOT THINKING OF PEACE HE ONLY WANTED TIME TO CARRY OUT A PLAN HE HAD MADE TO DESTROY THE ROMAN FLEET ONE DARK NIGHT DURING THE TRUCE HE FILLED THE LARGEST OF HIS SHIPS
2289-152254-0028 IN AMONG THE ROMAN SHIPS TOWING BEHIND THEM LARGE BOATS FILLED WITH MATERIAL THAT WOULD EASILY BURN THESE BOATS WERE SET ON FIRE AND FLOATED AGAINST THE ROMAN VESSELS WHICH ALSO WERE SOON ON FIRE THE FLAMES QUICKLY SPREAD
2289-152254-0029 AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME A GREAT PART OF THE ROMAN FLEET WAS DESTROYED BASILICUS FLED WITH AS MANY SHIPS AS HE COULD SAVE AND RETURNED TO CONSTANTINOPLE THIS WAS THE LAST ATTEMPT OF THE ROMANS TO CONQUER THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0000 IN THE TIME OF CLOVIS THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED BULGARIA WAS INHABITED BY GOTHS ONE DAY A POOR SHEPHERD BOY ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE LEFT HIS MOUNTAIN HOME IN THAT COUNTRY TO GO TO THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH WAS MANY MILES AWAY
2289-152257-0001 BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE TO WALK EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD AND LIVE ON FRUITS THAT HE COULD GATHER BY THE WAY HE WAS A BRIGHT CLEVER BOY WHO HAD SPENT HIS LIFE HITHERTO IN A VILLAGE BUT WAS NOW EAGER TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
2289-152257-0002 TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS BOY'S UNCLE WHO WAS NAMED JUSTIN HAD GONE TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND JOINED THE ROMAN ARMY HE WAS SO BRAVE AND SO GOOD A SOLDIER THAT HE SOON CAME TO BE
2289-152257-0003 COMMANDER OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD WHICH ATTENDED THE EMPEROR THE POOR SHEPHERD BOY HAD HEARD OF THE SUCCESS OF HIS UNCLE AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HE RESOLVED TO SET OFF FOR THE BIG CITY SO HE STARTED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
2289-152257-0004 AND TRUDGED ALONG THE VALLEY IN HIGH HOPE FEELING CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REACH THE END OF HIS JOURNEY IN SAFETY
2289-152257-0005 AND TO CROSS RIVERS AND HIGH HILLS BUT AT LAST ONE AFTERNOON IN MIDSUMMER HE WALKED THROUGH THE MAIN GATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE PROUD AND HAPPY THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS PURPOSE HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING HIS UNCLE JUSTIN
2289-152257-0006 AND GAVE HIM THE BEST EDUCATION THAT COULD BE HAD IN THE CITY
2289-152257-0007 RICHLY DRESSED HE WAS WELL LIKED AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT AND WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEARNING TWO ONE DAY A GREAT CHANGE CAME FOR BOTH UNCLE AND NEPHEW THE EMPEROR DIED
2289-152257-0008 IN RULING THE EMPIRE JUSTINUS AGREED TO THIS PROPOSAL FOR HE WAS NOW OLD AND IN FEEBLE HEALTH AND NOT ABLE HIMSELF TO ATTEND TO THE IMPORTANT AFFAIRS OF GOVERNMENT
2289-152257-0009 JUSTINIAN REIGNED FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND DID SO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED JUSTINIAN THE GREAT HE HAD MANY WARS DURING HIS REIGN BUT HE HIMSELF DID NOT TAKE PART IN THEM
2289-152257-0010 HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO HAVE TWO GREAT GENERALS TO LEAD HIS ARMIES ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED BELISARIUS AND THE OTHER NARSES BELISARIUS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOLDIERS THAT EVER LIVED
2289-152257-0011 HE GAINED WONDERFUL VICTORIES FOR JUSTINIAN AND CONQUERED SOME OF THE OLD ROMAN PROVINCES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR MANY YEARS THE VICTORIES OF THESE TWO GENERALS LARGELY HELPED TO MAKE THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN REMARKABLE IN HISTORY
2289-152257-0012 THAT WERE CARRIED ON A FLEET OF SIX HUNDRED SHIPS IT TOOK THIS FLEET THREE MONTHS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE FROM CONSTANTINOPLE TO AFRICA THE SAME VOYAGE MAY NOW BE MADE IN A VERY FEW DAYS BUT IN THE TIME OF BELISARIUS THERE WERE NO STEAMSHIPS
2289-152257-0013 AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE POWER OF STEAM FOR MOVING MACHINERY THE SHIPS OR GALLEYS WERE SAILING VESSELS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO WIND THEY COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS EXCEPT BY ROWING WHEN BELISARIUS REACHED AFRICA
2289-152257-0014 HE LEFT FIVE MEN AS A GUARD IN EACH VESSEL AND WITH THE BODY OF HIS ARMY HE MARCHED FOR SOME DAYS ALONG THE COAST THE PEOPLE RECEIVED HIM IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THEY HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE RULE OF THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0015 AND PREFERRED TO BE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ROMANS ABOUT TEN MILES FROM CARTHAGE HE MET A LARGE ARMY LED BY THE BROTHER OF GELIMER A BATTLE IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLACE AND THE VANDALS WERE UTTERLY DEFEATED
2289-152257-0016 GELIMER GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BELISARIUS WHO TOOK HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE JUSTINIAN SET APART AN ESTATE FOR HIM TO LIVE UPON AND THE CONQUERED KING PASSED THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PEACEFUL RETIREMENT
2289-152257-0017 AFTER CONQUERING THE VANDALS JUSTINIAN RESOLVED TO CONQUER ITALY WHICH WAS THEN HELD BY THE OSTROGOTHS A LARGE ARMY WAS GOT TOGETHER AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF BELISARIUS AND NARSES WHO IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR ITALY
2289-152257-0018 WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE THEY MARCHED STRAIGHT TO ROME AND AFTER SOME FIGHTING
2289-152257-0019 BUT IN A FEW MONTHS VIT'I GES KING OF THE GOTHS APPEARED WITH AN ARMY BEFORE THE GATES AND CHALLENGED BELISARIUS AND NARSES TO COME OUT AND FIGHT THE ROMAN GENERALS HOWEVER
2289-152257-0020 LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY THINKING THAT HE WOULD COMPEL THE ROMANS TO SURRENDER BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THOUGHT OF SURRENDER BELISARIUS WAS PREPARING HIS MEN FOR FIGHT AND WHEN THEY WERE READY HE ATTACKED VITIGES AND DEFEATED HIM
2289-152257-0021 VITIGES RETIRED TO RAVENNA AND BELISARIUS QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND MADE SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY THAT IT WAS COMPELLED TO SURRENDER THE OSTROGOTH ARMY WAS CAPTURED
2289-152257-0022 FOR A LONG TIME THE GRANDEST CHURCH STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD THE GREAT TEMPLE STILL EXISTS IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR
2289-152257-0023 THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS MOST CELEBRATED WAS THE IMPROVING AND COLLECTING OF THE LAWS HE MADE MANY EXCELLENT NEW LAWS AND REFORMED MANY OF THE OLD LAWS SO THAT HE BECAME FAMOUS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE WORLD'S LEGISLATORS
2289-152257-0024 FOR A LONG TIME THE ROMAN LAWS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A VAST NUMBER OF THEM AND DIFFERENT WRITERS DIFFERED WIDELY AS TO WHAT THE LAWS REALLY WERE AND WHAT THEY MEANT JUSTINIAN EMPLOYED A GREAT LAWYER NAMED
2289-152257-0025 TRIB O'NI AN TO COLLECT AND SIMPLIFY THE PRINCIPAL LAWS THE COLLECTION WHICH HE MADE WAS CALLED THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN IT STILL EXISTS AND IS THE MODEL ACCORDING TO WHICH MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAVE MADE THEIR LAWS
2289-152257-0026 JUSTINIAN ALSO DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD BY ESTABLISHING A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURES IN CONSTANTINOPLE IT WAS HE WHO FIRST BROUGHT SILK WORMS INTO EUROPE TO THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE JUSTINIAN WAS STRONG AND ACTIVE
2289-152257-0027 AND A HARD WORKER HE OFTEN WORKED OR STUDIED ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WITHOUT EATING OR SLEEPING
4859-29340-0000 WHAT FORCE MOVES THE NATIONS BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF SEPARATE NATIONS UNDERSTAND THIS FORCE AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS IN THEIR NARRATION EVENTS OCCUR SOLELY BY THE WILL OF A NAPOLEON AND ALEXANDER
4859-29340-0001 OR IN GENERAL OF THE PERSONS THEY DESCRIBE THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THIS KIND OF HISTORIAN TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT FORCE CAUSES EVENTS TO HAPPEN ARE SATISFACTORY ONLY AS LONG AS THERE IS BUT ONE HISTORIAN TO EACH EVENT
4859-29340-0002 AS SOON AS HISTORIANS OF DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES AND TENDENCIES BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE SAME EVENT THE REPLIES THEY GIVE IMMEDIATELY LOSE ALL MEANING FOR THIS FORCE IS UNDERSTOOD BY THEM ALL NOT ONLY DIFFERENTLY BUT OFTEN IN QUITE CONTRADICTORY WAYS
4859-29340-0003 ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT AN EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY ALEXANDER'S
4859-29340-0004 BESIDES THIS HISTORIANS OF THAT KIND CONTRADICT EACH OTHER EVEN IN THEIR STATEMENT AS TO THE FORCE ON WHICH THE AUTHORITY OF SOME PARTICULAR PERSON WAS BASED THIERS A BONAPARTIST SAYS THAT NAPOLEON'S POWER WAS BASED ON HIS VIRTUE AND GENIUS
4859-29340-0005 LANFREY A REPUBLICAN SAYS IT WAS BASED ON HIS TRICKERY AND DECEPTION OF THE PEOPLE SO THE HISTORIANS OF THIS CLASS BY MUTUALLY DESTROYING ONE ANOTHER'S POSITIONS DESTROY THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0006 AND FURNISH NO REPLY TO HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY WHO DEAL WITH ALL THE NATIONS SEEM TO RECOGNIZE HOW ERRONEOUS IS THE SPECIALIST HISTORIANS VIEW OF THE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0007 THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS BUT AS THE RESULTANT OF A MULTIPLICITY OF VARIOUSLY DIRECTED FORCES IN DESCRIBING A WAR OR THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE A GENERAL HISTORIAN LOOKS FOR THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT
4859-29340-0008 NOT IN THE POWER OF ONE MAN BUT IN THE INTERACTION OF MANY PERSONS CONNECTED WITH THE EVENT ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW THE POWER OF HISTORICAL PERSONAGES REPRESENTED AS THE PRODUCT OF MANY FORCES CAN NO LONGER IT WOULD SEEM
4859-29340-0009 BE REGARDED AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS YET IN MOST CASES UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STILL EMPLOY THE CONCEPTION OF POWER AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS AND TREAT IT AS THEIR CAUSE
4859-29340-0010 IN THEIR EXPOSITION AN HISTORIC CHARACTER IS FIRST THE PRODUCT OF HIS TIME AND HIS POWER ONLY THE RESULTANT OF VARIOUS FORCES AND THEN HIS POWER IS ITSELF A FORCE PRODUCING EVENTS GERVINUS SCHLOSSER AND OTHERS FOR INSTANCE
4859-29340-0011 AT ONE TIME PROVE NAPOLEON TO BE A PRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION OF THE IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE AND SO FORTH AND AT ANOTHER PLAINLY SAY THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE AND OTHER THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE WERE SIMPLY THE PRODUCT OF NAPOLEON'S MISDIRECTED WILL
4859-29340-0012 AND THAT THE VERY IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WERE ARRESTED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY NAPOLEON'S CAPRICE THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE PRODUCED NAPOLEON'S POWER BUT NAPOLEON'S POWER SUPPRESSED THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION
4859-29340-0013 AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE THIS CURIOUS CONTRADICTION IS NOT ACCIDENTAL NOT ONLY DOES IT OCCUR AT EVERY STEP BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS ACCOUNTS ARE ALL MADE UP OF A CHAIN OF SUCH CONTRADICTIONS
4859-29340-0014 THIS CONTRADICTION OCCURS BECAUSE AFTER ENTERING THE FIELD OF ANALYSIS THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STOP HALFWAY TO FIND COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO THE COMPOSITE OR RESULTANT FORCE THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS MUST EQUAL THE RESULTANT
4859-29340-0015 AND SO TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTANT FORCES THEY ARE OBLIGED TO ADMIT IN ADDITION TO THE INSUFFICIENT COMPONENTS ANOTHER UNEXPLAINED FORCE AFFECTING THE RESULTANT ACTION
4859-29340-0016 SPECIALIST HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN OR THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS PLAINLY ASSERT THAT THESE EVENTS WERE PRODUCED BY THE WILL OF ALEXANDER BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIAN GERVINUS REFUTING THIS OPINION OF THE SPECIALIST HISTORIAN
4859-29340-0017 TRIES TO PROVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN AND THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS WERE DUE TO OTHER THINGS BESIDE ALEXANDER'S WILL SUCH AS THE ACTIVITY OF STEIN METTERNICH MADAME DE STAEL TALLEYRAND
4859-29340-0018 FICHTE CHATEAUBRIAND AND OTHERS THE HISTORIAN EVIDENTLY DECOMPOSES ALEXANDER'S POWER INTO THE COMPONENTS TALLEYRAND CHATEAUBRIAND AND THE REST BUT THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THE INTERACTIONS OF CHATEAUBRIAND
4859-29340-0019 TALLEYRAND MADAME DE STAEL AND THE OTHERS EVIDENTLY DOES NOT EQUAL THE RESULTANT NAMELY THE PHENOMENON OF MILLIONS OF FRENCHMEN SUBMITTING TO THE BOURBONS THAT CHATEAUBRIAND MADAME DE STAEL
4859-29340-0020 BUT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS AND THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN HOW FROM THESE RELATIONS OF THEIRS THE SUBMISSION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RESULTED THAT IS HOW COMPONENT FORCES EQUAL TO ONE A GAVE A RESULTANT EQUAL TO A THOUSAND TIMES A
4859-29340-0021 THE HISTORIAN IS AGAIN OBLIGED TO FALL BACK ON POWER THE FORCE HE HAD DENIED AND TO RECOGNIZE IT AS THE RESULTANT OF THE FORCES THAT IS HE HAS TO ADMIT AN UNEXPLAINED FORCE ACTING ON THE RESULTANT
4859-29340-0022 AND THAT IS JUST WHAT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS DO AND CONSEQUENTLY
4859-29340-0023 BUT CONTRADICT THEMSELVES PEASANTS HAVING NO CLEAR IDEA OF THE CAUSE OF RAIN SAY ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY WANT RAIN OR FINE WEATHER THE WIND HAS BLOWN THE CLOUDS AWAY OR THE WIND HAS BROUGHT UP THE CLOUDS
4859-29340-0024 AND IN THE SAME WAY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS SOMETIMES WHEN IT PLEASES THEM AND FITS IN WITH THEIR THEORY SAY THAT POWER IS THE RESULT OF EVENTS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING ELSE SAY THAT POWER PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0025 A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS THE SO CALLED HISTORIANS OF CULTURE FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS AGAIN TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
4859-29340-0026 THEY SEE IT IN WHAT IS CALLED CULTURE IN MENTAL ACTIVITY THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE ARE QUITE CONSISTENT IN REGARD TO THEIR PROGENITORS THE WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORIES FOR IF HISTORICAL EVENTS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS TREATED ONE ANOTHER IN SUCH AND SUCH WAYS
4859-29340-0027 WHY NOT EXPLAIN THEM BY THE FACT THAT SUCH AND SUCH PEOPLE WROTE SUCH AND SUCH BOOKS OF THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF INDICATIONS ACCOMPANYING EVERY VITAL PHENOMENON THESE HISTORIANS SELECT THE INDICATION OF INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND SAY THAT THIS INDICATION IS THE CAUSE
4859-29340-0028 ONLY BY A GREAT STRETCH CAN ONE ADMIT THAT THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES AND IN NO CASE CAN ONE ADMIT THAT INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY CONTROLS PEOPLE'S ACTIONS
4859-29340-0029 FOR THAT VIEW IS NOT CONFIRMED BY SUCH FACTS AS THE VERY CRUEL MURDERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION RESULTING FROM THE DOCTRINE OF THE EQUALITY OF MAN OR THE VERY CRUEL WARS AND EXECUTIONS RESULTING FROM THE PREACHING OF LOVE BUT EVEN ADMITTING AS CORRECT
4859-29340-0030 ALL THE CUNNINGLY DEVISED ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH THESE HISTORIES ARE FILLED ADMITTING THAT NATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY SOME UNDEFINED FORCE CALLED AN IDEA HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION STILL REMAINS UNANSWERED
4859-29340-0031 AND TO THE FORMER POWER OF MONARCHS AND TO THE INFLUENCE OF ADVISERS AND OTHER PEOPLE INTRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS ANOTHER NEWER FORCE THE IDEA IS ADDED THE CONNECTION OF WHICH WITH THE MASSES NEEDS EXPLANATION
4859-29340-0032 IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NAPOLEON HAD POWER AND SO EVENTS OCCURRED WITH SOME EFFORT ONE MAY EVEN CONCEIVE THAT NAPOLEON TOGETHER WITH OTHER INFLUENCES WAS THE CAUSE OF AN EVENT BUT HOW A BOOK
4859-29340-0033 HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING FRENCHMEN BEGIN TO DROWN ONE ANOTHER CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSAL NEXUS OF THIS NEW FORCE WITH THE EVENT UNDOUBTEDLY SOME RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN ALL WHO LIVE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY
4859-29340-0034 JUST AS SUCH A CONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCE HANDICRAFT GARDENING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE
4859-29340-0035 ONE THAT HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY LEARNED MEN AND SO IT IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE FOR THEM TO THINK THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THEIR CLASS SUPPLIES THE BASIS OF THE MOVEMENT OF ALL HUMANITY JUST AS A SIMILAR BELIEF IS NATURAL AND AGREEABLE
4859-29340-0036 TO TRADERS AGRICULTURISTS AND SOLDIERS IF THEY DO NOT EXPRESS IT THAT IS MERELY BECAUSE TRADERS AND SOLDIERS DO NOT WRITE HISTORY AND TWO THAT SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY ENLIGHTENMENT CIVILIZATION CULTURE IDEAS ARE ALL INDISTINCT
4859-29340-0037 INDEFINITE CONCEPTIONS UNDER WHOSE BANNER IT IS VERY EASY TO USE WORDS HAVING A STILL LESS DEFINITE MEANING AND WHICH CAN THEREFORE BE READILY INTRODUCED INTO ANY THEORY BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE INTRINSIC QUALITY OF HISTORIES OF THIS KIND
4859-29340-0038 WHICH MAY POSSIBLY EVEN BE OF USE TO SOMEONE FOR SOMETHING THE HISTORIES OF CULTURE
4859-29340-0039 ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM THE FACT THAT AFTER SERIOUSLY AND MINUTELY EXAMINING
4859-29340-0040 AS SOON AS THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE AN ACTUAL HISTORIC EVENT SUCH AS THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE FOR INSTANCE THEY INVOLUNTARILY DESCRIBE IT AS RESULTING FROM AN EXERCISE OF POWER AND SAY PLAINLY THAT THAT WAS THE RESULT OF NAPOLEON'S WILL SPEAKING SO
4859-29340-0041 THE HISTORIANS OF CULTURE INVOLUNTARILY CONTRADICT THEMSELVES AND SHOW THAT THE NEW FORCE THEY HAVE DEVISED DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN HISTORY
4859-26870-0000 AT FIRST HE SAW NOTHING REPREHENSIBLE IN THIS BUT IN THE SECOND YEAR OF HIS MARRIAGE HIS VIEW OF THAT FORM OF PUNISHMENT SUDDENLY CHANGED ONCE IN SUMMER HE HAD SENT FOR THE VILLAGE ELDER FROM BOGUCHAROVO
4859-26870-0001 A MAN WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE POST WHEN DRON DIED AND WHO WAS ACCUSED OF DISHONESTY AND VARIOUS IRREGULARITIES NICHOLAS WENT OUT INTO THE PORCH TO QUESTION HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ELDER HAD GIVEN A FEW REPLIES THE SOUND OF CRIES AND BLOWS WERE HEARD
4859-26870-0002 ON RETURNING TO LUNCH NICHOLAS WENT UP TO HIS WIFE WHO SAT WITH HER HEAD BENT LOW OVER HER EMBROIDERY FRAME AND AS USUAL BEGAN TO TELL HER WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THAT MORNING AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SPOKE OF THE BOGUCHAROVO ELDER COUNTESS MARY TURNED RED AND THEN PALE
4859-26870-0003 SUCH AN INSOLENT SCOUNDREL HE CRIED GROWING HOT AGAIN AT THE MERE RECOLLECTION OF HIM IF HE HAD TOLD ME HE WAS DRUNK AND DID NOT SEE BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MARY HE SUDDENLY ASKED
4859-26870-0004 WHY WHATEVER IS THE MATTER MY DEAREST THE LOOKS OF THE PLAIN COUNTESS MARY ALWAYS IMPROVED WHEN SHE WAS IN TEARS SHE NEVER CRIED FROM PAIN OR VEXATION BUT ALWAYS FROM SORROW OR PITY AND WHEN SHE WEPT HER RADIANT EYES ACQUIRED AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARM
4859-26870-0005 THE MOMENT NICHOLAS TOOK HER HAND SHE COULD NO LONGER RESTRAIN HERSELF AND BEGAN TO CRY NICHOLAS I SAW IT HE WAS TO BLAME BUT WHY DO YOU NICHOLAS AND SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS NICHOLAS SAID NOTHING HE FLUSHED CRIMSON LEFT HER SIDE AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
4859-26870-0006 HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE WAS WEEPING ABOUT BUT COULD NOT IN HIS HEART AT ONCE AGREE WITH HER THAT WHAT HE HAD REGARDED FROM CHILDHOOD AS QUITE AN EVERYDAY EVENT WAS WRONG IS IT JUST SENTIMENTALITY OLD WIVES TALES OR IS SHE RIGHT HE ASKED HIMSELF
4859-26870-0007 MARY HE SAID SOFTLY GOING UP TO HER IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN I GIVE YOU MY WORD NEVER HE REPEATED IN A TREMBLING VOICE LIKE A BOY ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS
4859-26870-0008 SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND KISSED IT NICHOLAS WHEN DID YOU BREAK YOUR CAMEO SHE ASKED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT LOOKING AT HIS FINGER ON WHICH HE WORE A RING WITH A CAMEO OF LAOCOON'S HEAD TODAY IT WAS THE SAME AFFAIR OH MARY DON'T REMIND ME OF IT AND AGAIN HE FLUSHED
4859-26870-0009 I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR IT SHAN'T OCCUR AGAIN AND LET THIS ALWAYS BE A REMINDER TO ME AND HE POINTED TO THE BROKEN RING AFTER THAT WHEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS VILLAGE ELDERS OR STEWARDS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS FACE AND HIS FISTS BEGAN TO CLENCH
4859-26870-0010 NICHOLAS WOULD TURN THE BROKEN RING ON HIS FINGER AND WOULD DROP HIS EYES BEFORE THE MAN WHO WAS MAKING HIM ANGRY BUT HE DID FORGET HIMSELF ONCE OR TWICE WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH AND THEN HE WOULD GO AND CONFESS TO HIS WIFE AND WOULD AGAIN PROMISE THAT THIS SHOULD REALLY BE THE VERY LAST TIME
4859-26870-0011 MARY YOU MUST DESPISE ME HE WOULD SAY I DESERVE IT YOU SHOULD GO GO AWAY AT ONCE IF YOU DON'T FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TO CONTROL YOURSELF SHE WOULD REPLY SADLY TRYING TO COMFORT HER HUSBAND AMONG THE GENTRY OF THE PROVINCE NICHOLAS WAS RESPECTED BUT NOT LIKED
4859-26870-0012 HE DID NOT CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE INTERESTS OF HIS OWN CLASS AND CONSEQUENTLY SOME THOUGHT HIM PROUD AND OTHERS THOUGHT HIM STUPID THE WHOLE SUMMER FROM SPRING SOWING TO HARVEST HE WAS BUSY WITH THE WORK ON HIS FARM IN AUTUMN HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO HUNTING WITH THE SAME BUSINESS LIKE SERIOUSNESS
4859-26870-0013 LEAVING HOME FOR A MONTH OR EVEN TWO WITH HIS HUNT IN WINTER HE VISITED HIS OTHER VILLAGES OR SPENT HIS TIME READING THE BOOKS HE READ WERE CHIEFLY HISTORICAL AND ON THESE HE SPENT A CERTAIN SUM EVERY YEAR
4859-26870-0014 READING A TASK HE FIRST IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF AS A DUTY BUT WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME A HABIT AFFORDING HIM A SPECIAL KIND OF PLEASURE AND A CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING OCCUPIED WITH SERIOUS MATTERS
4859-26870-0015 IN WINTER EXCEPT FOR BUSINESS EXCURSIONS HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME AT HOME MAKING HIMSELF ONE WITH HIS FAMILY AND ENTERING INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF HIS CHILDREN'S RELATIONS WITH THEIR MOTHER THE HARMONY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE GREW CLOSER AND CLOSER
4859-26870-0016 AND HE DAILY DISCOVERED FRESH SPIRITUAL TREASURES IN HER FROM THE TIME OF HIS MARRIAGE SONYA HAD LIVED IN HIS HOUSE BEFORE THAT NICHOLAS HAD TOLD HIS WIFE ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND SONYA BLAMING HIMSELF AND COMMENDING HER
4859-26870-0017 HE HAD ASKED PRINCESS MARY TO BE GENTLE AND KIND TO HIS COUSIN SHE THOROUGHLY REALIZED THE WRONG HE HAD DONE SONYA FELT HERSELF TO BLAME TOWARD HER AND IMAGINED THAT HER WEALTH HAD INFLUENCED NICHOLAS CHOICE
4859-26870-0018 BUT OFTEN FELT ILL WILL TOWARD HER WHICH SHE COULD NOT OVERCOME ONCE SHE HAD A TALK WITH HER FRIEND NATASHA ABOUT SONYA AND ABOUT HER OWN INJUSTICE TOWARD HER YOU KNOW SAID NATASHA YOU HAVE READ THE GOSPELS A GREAT DEAL THERE IS A PASSAGE IN THEM THAT JUST FITS SONYA WHAT ASKED COUNTESS MARY SURPRISED
4859-26870-0019 TO HIM THAT HATH SHALL BE GIVEN AND FROM HIM THAT HATH NOT SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY YOU REMEMBER SHE IS ONE THAT HATH NOT WHY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS SHE LACKS EGOTISM I DON'T KNOW BUT FROM HER IS TAKEN AWAY AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY
4859-26870-0020 SHE IS A STERILE FLOWER YOU KNOW LIKE SOME STRAWBERRY BLOSSOMS
4859-26870-0021 THOUGH COUNTESS MARY TOLD NATASHA THAT THOSE WORDS IN THE GOSPEL MUST BE UNDERSTOOD DIFFERENTLY YET LOOKING AT SONYA SHE AGREED WITH NATASHA'S EXPLANATION
4859-26870-0022 AND HAD GROWN QUITE RECONCILED TO HER LOT AS A STERILE FLOWER SHE SEEMED TO BE FOND NOT SO MUCH OF INDIVIDUALS AS OF THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE LIKE A CAT SHE HAD ATTACHED HERSELF NOT TO THE PEOPLE BUT TO THE HOME
4859-26870-0023 SHE WAITED ON THE OLD COUNTESS PETTED AND SPOILED THE CHILDREN WAS ALWAYS READY TO RENDER THE SMALL SERVICES FOR WHICH SHE HAD A GIFT AND ALL THIS WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACCEPTED FROM HER WITH INSUFFICIENT GRATITUDE THE COUNTRY SEAT AT BALD HILLS HAD BEEN REBUILT THOUGH NOT ON THE SAME SCALE AS UNDER THE OLD PRINCE
4859-26870-0024 THE BUILDINGS BEGUN UNDER STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES WERE MORE THAN SIMPLE THE IMMENSE HOUSE ON THE OLD STONE FOUNDATIONS WAS OF WOOD PLASTERED ONLY INSIDE IT HAD BARE DEAL FLOORS AND WAS FURNISHED WITH VERY SIMPLE HARD SOFAS ARMCHAIRS TABLES AND CHAIRS
4859-26870-0025 MADE BY THEIR OWN SERF CARPENTERS OUT OF THEIR OWN BIRCHWOOD THE HOUSE WAS SPACIOUS AND HAD ROOMS FOR THE HOUSE SERFS AND APARTMENTS FOR VISITORS WHOLE FAMILIES OF THE ROSTOVS AND BOLKONSKIS RELATIONS SOMETIMES CAME TO BALD HILLS WITH SIXTEEN HORSES AND DOZENS OF SERVANTS AND STAYED FOR MONTHS
8098-278252-0000 MUCH POMP AND SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WILLOUGHBY WE WENT TO CLEVELAND MY ROUTE THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL CITY LAY ALONG ONE OF THE FINEST RESIDENCE STREETS IN AMERICA THE FAMOUS EUCLID AVENUE
8098-278252-0001 FROM THERE WE MARCHED TO SUPERIOR STREET WHERE CHEERS GREETED US ON EVERY HAND THE PAPERS HAD HERALDED MY ADVENT AND AS IN THE OTHER TOWNS AND CITIES
8098-278252-0002 THE NEWSPAPER ARTISTS HAD TAXED THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE POD AND MAC
8098-278252-0003 AND WHEN I RODE OUT ON TO THE STAGE THE HOUSE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER AND CHEERS I MADE A SHORT ADDRESS AND ANNOUNCED THAT I WOULD SELL PHOTOS OF MAC A'RONY AND HIS MASTER AT THE DOOR
8098-278252-0004 THAT THEATRE PUT ME WAY AHEAD FINANCIALLY THURSDAY MORNING I CALLED ON THE MAYOR MARK HANNA AND SENATOR GARFIELD AND ADDED THE AUTOGRAPHS OF ALL THREE TO MY ALBUM
8098-278252-0005 MISTER GARFIELD INVITED ME TO ATTEND THE WEEKLY DINNER AND RECEPTION OF THE BEER AND SKITTLES CLUB THAT EVENING I WENT AND ENJOYED MYSELF
8098-278252-0006 ONLY MAKING THIRTEEN MILES
8098-278252-0007 A MILE BEYOND TWO MEN REMINDED ME IT WAS A VERY WINTRY DAY THEN A WOMAN DROVE PAST AND TOSSED ME THE COMFORTING REMINDER DON'T YOU FIND IT AWFULLY COLD I DID NOT REPLY TO THE LAST TWO
8098-278252-0008 TWENTY MINUTES LATER A BOY FROM A COZY HOME YELLED TO ME I HAD PASSED TO SOME DISTANCE AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SOUNDED LIKE
8098-278252-0009 I HESITATED A MOMENT IN THE BITING WIND THEN RETRACED MY STEPS AND CALLED TO THE LAD WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID
8098-278252-0010 YELLED THE SCAMP I WAS MAD ENOUGH TO UNLOAD MY WINCHESTER BUT I DIDN'T
8098-278252-0011 RUBBED MY EARS AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY LIKE AN ICE COVERED VOLCANO A MILE BEYOND A WAGON WITH A FAMILY IN IT PASSED ME AND THE MAN SAID COLD MY FRIEND AT DUSK A FARMER INQUIRED
8098-278252-0012 I SHOUTED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE RIG STOPPED A FUR CLAD HEAD STUCK OUT TO ONE SIDE AND A MALE VOICE CALLED
8098-278252-0013 I AMBLED UP PUT A FOOT ON THE HUB OF A WHEEL AND SAID I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY IT'S A COLD DAY YOU AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED I SAID BY WAY OF CIVIL EXPLANATION
8098-278252-0014 MY DEAR SIR DO YOU KNOW A HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED ME TO DAY AND TOLD ME IT IS COLD I HAVE TRAMPED NEARLY TWENTY MILES WITHOUT STOPPING TO WARM OR EAT
8098-278252-0015 AND I RESOLVED TO LET THE NEXT FELLOW HAVE THE SAME DOSE I HAVE BEEN TAKING HALF HOURLY ALL DAY NOW IF YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT IT IS A COLD DAY I WILL BID YOU GOOD NIGHT
8098-278252-0016 WITH THIS I RETURNED TO MY COMPANIONS SOMEWHAT WARMER PHYSICALLY BUT COOLER IN SPIRIT THE HOTEL IN CUYAHOGA FALLS RECEIVED US MOST HOSPITABLY
8098-278252-0017 I NEVER SHALL FORGET THE KINDNESSES OF ITS LANDLADY THE VILLAGE DATES BACK TO PIONEER DAYS IT IS BUILT ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE OLD CUYAHOGA INDIANS MONDAY MARCH FIRST AT TWELVE THIRTY P M
8098-278252-0018 WAVING HATS AND ARMS AND CALLING TO ME TO BE THEIR GUEST I WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW WHICH INVITATION TO ACCEPT WHILE DELIBERATING ONE OF THE LANDLORDS APPROACHED AND TAKING MY ARM LED ME TO HIS COMFORTABLE HOSTELRY
8098-278252-0019 WHERE HE ROYALLY ENTERTAINED ME AND MY ANIMALS THE PAGEANT THAT CELEBRATED THE DEPARTURE OF WILLIAM MC KINLEY TO THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT WAS A FAIR ESTIMATE OF THE REGARD IN WHICH HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HELD HIM
8098-278252-0020 CANTON DID HIM HONOR I WITNESSED THE LEAVE TAKING AT HIS HOUSE HIS RIDE TO THE TRAIN IN THE COACH DRAWN BY FOUR GREYS UNDER ESCORT OF A BAND
8098-278252-0021 AND HEARD HIM DELIVER HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS FROM THE REAR PLATFORM OF HIS PRIVATE CAR I SPENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN MASSILLON AND NEXT MORNING RETURNED TO CANTON TO TAKE SOME INTERIOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF MC KINLEY'S HOME

8098-278252-0023 CANNON BOOMED STEAM WHISTLES SHRIEKED AND THE CITIZENS SHOUTED AND HURRAHED AND I WAS GLAD MAC WAS NOT WITH ME TO ADD HIS SALUTE
8098-278252-0024 I SAW A MEADOW LARK ON THE FIRST OF MARCH THIS DAY I HEARD BLUE BIRDS AND ROBINS SINGING GAILY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SPRING HAD COME TO STAY I EXPECTED THAT DAY TO REACH DALTON ONLY EIGHT MILES DISTANT
8098-278252-0025 THAT ONCE I WAS COMPELLED TO CRAWL ALONG THE TOP OF A RAIL FENCE TWO HUNDRED FEET AND MORE AND DRAG MY JACKASS AT DUSK I HAD COVERED ONLY THREE MILES THEN I SOUGHT LODGINGS
8098-278252-0026 A STORE LOOMED INTO VIEW SHORTLY I WAS ELATED ACCORDING TO THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE THE YOUNGER GENERATION WAS THE RULING POWER IT READ HEZEKIAH BRIMLEY AND FATHER
8098-278252-0027 I MADE FOR HEZ HE SAID THE TOWN HADN'T REACHED THE HOTEL STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT YET BUT THAT HE WOULD GLADLY TAKE ME IN PROVIDED I'D SLEEP WITH HIS CLERK IN THE GARRET
8098-278252-0028 I FOUND THE STORE FULL OF LOUNGERS WHO PATRONIZED THE CHAIRS SOAP AND STARCH BOXES MACKEREL KITS AND COUNTER FORMING A SILENT CIRCLE ROUND A TOWERING STOVE IN THE CENTER
8098-278252-0029 THE VILLAGE TREASURER WORE A BOILED SHIRT AND BRASS COLLAR BUTTONS BUT NO COLLAR OR COAT HIS COMPANIONS WERE GENERALLY ATTIRED IN FLANNEL SHIRTS OF DIFFERENT HUES AND PATTERNS
8098-278252-0030 AND FELT BOOTS ENCASED IN HEAVY OVERSHOES THESE RURAL MEN EYED ME WITH SUSPICION UNTIL I MENTIONED MAC A'RONY THEN THERE WAS A RUSH TO THE DOOR AS IT SWUNG OPEN IN LEAPED MY GREAT DOG
8098-278252-0031 CAME SEVERAL QUERIES IN A BUNCH NO I SAID HE HAS KILLED A BULL CHEWED UP A RAM MADE THANKS GIVING MINCE MEAT OF SEVERAL DOGS CHASED A PIG UP A TREE
8098-278252-0032 AND ONLY THIS MORNING ATE TWO CHICKENS AND A DUCK AND CHASED A FARMER INTO HIS HAY LOFT BUT HE DOESN'T BITE MY STATEMENT HAD A SENSATIONAL EFFECT ON THE ASSEMBLY WHO ONE BY ONE SNEAKED OUT OF THE DOOR
8098-278252-0033 LEAVING HEZ AND HIS ODD GUEST ALONE AS SOON AS THE JUNIOR MEMBER HEZ'S FATHER CAME IN HEZ TOOK MY ANIMALS TO THE SHED AND FED THEM AND TOLD ME TO HELP MYSELF TO THE BEST IN THE STORE
8098-278252-0034 A PINT OF CORNED OYSTERS LIGHT WEIGHT SOME CRACKERS AND LEAF LARD TO TAKE THE PLACE OF BUTTER AND A CAKE OF BITTER CHOCOLATE I LEFT A FEW THINGS UNMOLESTED SUCH AS SOAP
8098-278252-0035 TO BE GOOD CHOCOLATE MUST BE WELL DISSOLVED NO POT WAS TO BE HAD SAVE A FLOWER POT WITH A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM A GREAT IDEA POPPED INTO MY HEAD
8098-278252-0036 DID YOU EVER TRY IT IF NOT DON'T LET YOUR CURIOSITY GET THE BETTER OF YOU CHOCOLATE BELONGS TO THE BEAN FAMILY AND THE BEAN IS A VERY TREACHEROUS THING
8098-278252-0037 CHOCOLATE BEAN CASTOR OIL BEAN PORK BEAN AND ALL KINDS I FIRST ATE THE CAKE OF CHOCOLATE THEN SOME SUGAR AND DRANK TWO DIPPERSFUL OF HOT WATER THEN SHOOK MYSELF
8098-278252-0038 THAT MIXTURE MIGHT SUIT MY STOMACH I THOUGHT BUT IT DOESN'T DELIGHT MY PALATE I FELT I HAD EATEN A HEAVY MEAL UNWITTINGLY AND SAT DOWN TO DIGEST IT I HADN'T SAT LONG BEFORE I FELT MYSELF SWELLING
8098-278252-0039 SOMETHING WITHIN WAS SIZZLING AND BREWING AND STEAMING GAS AND STEAM CHOKED ME I WAS SURE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DEMONSTRATION IN MY HONOR THAT I HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR THE YEAST CAKE CAME TO MIND THEN I KNEW THE CAUSE
8098-278252-0040 AFTER WHICH I EXCUSED MYSELF TO THE CLERK AND WENT TO BED AND DREAMED I WAS BEING CREMATED ALIVE
8098-278278-0000 BY MAC A'RONY YOU DO ILL TO TEACH THE CHILD SUCH WORDS HE TEACHES HIM TO KICK AND TO HACK WHICH THEY'LL DO FAST ENOUGH OF THEMSELVES AND TO CALL HORUM FYE UPON YOU
8098-278278-0001 MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR FREQUENTLY SINCE CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI POD HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM PROUD PARENTS INFORMING HIM THAT THEY HAD NAMED THEIR LATEST BOY AFTER HIM
8098-278278-0002 AT THAT TIME IN CRIPPLE CREEK SEVERAL BOYS RANGING FROM A DAY TO SIX WEEKS OLD WHOSE DESTINIES WERE THOUGHT TO BE PROMISING WERE AFFLICTED WITH MY MASTER'S PONDEROUS NAME
8098-278278-0003 A LITTLE GREEN EYED IRISH GIRL FIVE DAYS OLD WAS NAMED PYTHAGORINA PODINA MULGARRY
8098-278278-0004 THE HAPPY FATHER CALLED PERSONALLY ON POD AND ASKED HIM TO ACT AS GODFATHER AT THE BAPTISMAL SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AT THE CABIN OF MISS PYTHAGORINA
8098-278278-0005 AS THE AGED GRANDMOTHER WISHED TO WITNESS IT POD SAID HE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED ABOUT ATTENDING SINCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALMOST ALL HIS LATIN
8098-278278-0006 BUT HE ARRANGED WITH ONE OF THE PALL BEARERS TO GIVE HIM NUDGES AND KICKS WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE A RESPONSE AND SO HE GOT THROUGH FAIRLY WELL BETTER THAN THE KID DID HE SAID THE BABE WAS AN UNRULY CHILD
8098-278278-0007 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0008 THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AND SURPRISE BECAUSE THE FLATIRONS DIDN'T FLOAT AND THE UNDERTAKER OR WHAT YOU CALL EM OVERTURNED THE BARREL OF WATER AND SET EVERYBODY AFLOAT DRENCHING THE SPONSORS AND GUESTS
8098-278278-0009 POD SAID THE SCENE WAS WITHOUT A PARALLEL HE WAS SOAKED TO HIS EQUATOR THE HALF CHRISTENED HALF DROWNED PYTHAGORINA PODINA WAS PICKED UP FROM THE FLOOD WITH A TABLESPOON AND THE CEREMONY FINISHED
8098-278278-0010 THEN SHE WAS ROLLED ON THE BARREL TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT OF HER AND PUT TO BED WITH HOT FLATIRONS AT HER FEET TO PREVENT CROUP AND MUMPS THEN THE WAKE BROKE UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD A WORD THAT THE PRIEST SAID
8098-278278-0011 POD DIDN'T THAT NIGHT HE GOT UP A FINE SUPPER AND INVITED SOME OLD FRIENDS HE BOUGHT A BIG PORTERHOUSE STEAK THICK AND TENDER AND PERSONALLY BROILED IT ON HIS PATENT FOLDING STOVE
8098-278278-0012 JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
8098-278278-0013 POD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THOUGH BUT JUST FORKED IT ON TO THE PLATTER AND SCRAPED OFF SOME DRY GRASS AND A SLIVER AND A BUG AND CARVED IT UP
8098-278278-0014 THE LADIES LOOKED AT THE DOG AND THEN AT POD NOT KNOWING WHICH TO THANK THEN FEELING SENSITIVE ABOUT ACCEPTING THE BEST PART OF THE STEAK INSISTED UPON POD'S HAVING ONE OF THEIR PIECES AND COONSKIN THE OTHER
8098-278278-0015 AFTER SUPPER DON FEASTED ON THE TOUGHER PARTS OF THE STEAK AND WE DONKS WERE FED THE SCRAPS OF POTATOES AND BREAD AND TIN TOMATO AND PEACH CANS WHEN THE BANQUET WAS OVER THE GUESTS WENT HOME
8098-278278-0016 ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WE WENT INTO CAMP ON THE MARGIN OF A FAMOUS PETRIFIED FOREST POD OBJECTED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FIRE WOOD
8098-278278-0017 LOTS OF PETRIFIED WOOD CHIPS LYING AROUND I REMARKED AND THEY'LL LAST ORDINARY WOOD BURNS UP TOO FAST BRIGHT IDEA EXCLAIMED POD AND COONSKIN WENT TO WORK GATHERING PETRIFIED WOOD FOR THE SUPPER FIRE
8098-278278-0018 THE ONLY TROUBLE WILL BE IN STARTING THE FIRE SAID POD JUST AS SOON AS IT'S ONCE GOING IT OUGHT TO BURN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
8098-278278-0019 COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
8098-278278-0020 MEASURING UPWARDS OF FORTY FIVE FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SEVERAL SAWS WERE IMBEDDED IN IT FOR MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO TAKE OFF SOME SLICES FOR THE DENVER EXPOSITION
8098-278278-0021 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0022 SEVERAL TIMES I HAD A SUSPICION THAT WE HAD BEEN MISDIRECTED WHEN WE CAME TO THE END OF A NARROW WOOD ROAD I WAS SURE OF IT
8098-278278-0023 BEST TO GO THROUGH THE WOODS SAID THE VALET SO WE WERE HEADED FOR THE TIMBER OUR TRAMP THROUGH THE FOREST I CANNOT SOON FORGET UP AND DOWN THE ROCKY HEIGHTS THROUGH THICKETS OF QUAKING ASP AND PINE
8098-278278-0024 AND REALIZED WE WERE LOST COONSKIN SAID HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WOODMAN AND WOULD BLAZE THE TREES SO WE WOULD GET OUT AGAIN WONDERFUL THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING HE HAD GLEANED FROM DIME NOVELS
8098-278278-0025 HE LAGGED BEHIND TO DO THE BLAZING AND PRETTY SOON I SMELT SMOKE THE PROFESSOR SNUFFED SMELLS AS IF THE WOODS WERE ON FIRE SOMEWHERE HINTED POD LOOK BEHIND YOU THEY ARE I EXCLAIMED
8098-278278-0026 AND POD CAUGHT THAT ERUDITE VALET BACK WOODSMAN IN THE ACT OF SETTING A TREE ON FIRE WITH OIL AND MATCHES FORTUNATELY FOR US THE WIND WASN'T BLOWING STRONG
8098-278278-0027 BUT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR COURSE SOME AND HUSTLE FASTER FOR THE BLAZING TRAIL CHASED US COONSKIN LEARNED A NEW LESSON AND TURNED DOWN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE SO HE'D RECOLLECT IT
8098-278278-0028 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0029 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE DONKS WERE PICKETED AND ALLOWED TO GRAZE THEN COONSKIN WENT FISHING HE SAID HE HAD SEEN SOME TROUT IN THE STREAM BY SUPPER TIME HE HAD CAUGHT A NICE MESS
8098-278278-0030 POD SAID HE WOULD FRY THE FISH AND WENT AT IT SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT HE FORGOT TO PUT THE BAG OF CORN MEAL BACK IN ITS PLACE AFTER THE MEAL WAS OVER HE BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR THE BAG IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
8098-278278-0031 I HAD EATEN THE CORN MEAL AND BAG IT WAS COMICAL HOW THOSE TWO MEN PUZZLED THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THAT MISSING COMMODITY WHEN COONSKIN DETECTED SOME MEAL STAMPED IN THE GROUND POD POINTED AT ME AND SAID
8098-278278-0032 THAT'S THE THIEF THERE NEXT MORNING COONSKIN WAS THE FIRST TO RETURN FROM FISHING AND LOOKED MUCH EXCITED WHEN POD RETURNED HE TOLD HIM HE HAD SEEN HUGE BEAR TRACKS HE WAS GOING BEAR HUNTING POD LAUGHED AT HIM
8098-278278-0033 THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODS OF WISCONSIN THE MEN AT THE SAW MILL SAID WE SHOULD SEE BEAR IN THIS FOREST
8098-278278-0034 ITS SKIN WOULD FETCH FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE LET'S LOOK FOR BEAR WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU SAW A BEAR POD ASKED WELL NOW LEAVE THAT TO ME SAID COONSKIN
8098-278278-0035 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE WORTH A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE TO SEE ONE WILD I'VE ONLY SEEN BEARS IN CIRCUSES OR TRAVELING CHAINED TO ITALIANS IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN RUN I'VE PLENTY OF MEDALS FOR SPRINTING
8098-278278-0036 POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
8098-278278-0037 AND LAID DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WONDERED IF THAT CRAZY VALET HAD RUN ACROSS ANY MORE BEAR TRACKS HE WASN'T THERE LONG WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD YELLS ISSUING FROM THE CANYON DOWN STREAM ROUND THE BEND
8098-278278-0038 THE SHOUTING SOUNDED NEARER EVERY SECOND AND I SOON DISTINGUISHED COONSKIN'S VOICE POD GOT UP FROM THE GROUND EXCITEDLY COONSKIN'S IN TROUBLE PLAIN ENOUGH SAID POD ALOUD TO HIMSELF I MUST RUN TO HIS AID
8098-278278-0039 SO HE STARTED ON A TROT DOWN STREAM TO THE BEND AND THEN QUICKLY TURNED FALLING ALL OVER HIMSELF AND RAN TOWARD THE CABINS FASTER THAN I EVER SAW HIM RUN BEFORE OR SINCE
8098-278278-0040 AND IMMEDIATELY COONSKIN CAME FLYING INTO VIEW WITH THE BIGGEST BEAR AT HIS HEELS I EVER WANT TO SEE
6019-3185-0000 THAT SERIES OF TERRIFIC EVENTS BY WHICH OUR QUIET CITY AND UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF GERMANY WERE CONVULSED DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN HAS IN ITSELF AND CONSIDERED MERELY AS A BLIND MOVEMENT OF HUMAN TIGER PASSION
6019-3185-0001 RANGING UNCHAINED AMONG MEN SOMETHING TOO MEMORABLE TO BE FORGOTTEN OR LEFT WITHOUT ITS OWN SEPARATE RECORD BUT THE MORAL LESSON IMPRESSED BY THESE EVENTS IS YET MORE MEMORABLE
6019-3185-0002 AND DESERVES THE DEEP ATTENTION OF COMING GENERATIONS IN THEIR STRUGGLE AFTER HUMAN IMPROVEMENT NOT MERELY IN ITS OWN LIMITED FIELD OF INTEREST DIRECTLY AWAKENED BUT IN ALL ANALOGOUS FIELDS OF INTEREST
6019-3185-0003 AS IN FACT ALREADY AND MORE THAN ONCE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE VERY EVENTS THIS LESSON HAS OBTAINED THE EFFECTUAL ATTENTION OF CHRISTIAN KINGS AND PRINCES ASSEMBLED IN CONGRESS
6019-3185-0004 I KNEW FAMILIARLY ALL THE PARTIES WHO WERE CONCERNED IN IT EITHER AS SUFFERERS OR AS AGENTS I WAS PRESENT FROM FIRST TO LAST AND WATCHED THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS STORM WHICH FELL UPON OUR DEVOTED CITY
6019-3185-0005 IN A STRENGTH LIKE THAT OF A WEST INDIAN HURRICANE AND WHICH DID SERIOUSLY THREATEN AT ONE TIME TO DEPOPULATE OUR UNIVERSITY THROUGH THE DARK SUSPICIONS WHICH SETTLED UPON ITS MEMBERS AND THE NATURAL REACTION OF GENEROUS INDIGNATION IN REPELLING THEM
6019-3185-0006 BY SACRIFICING WHENEVER CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED THEM THEIR HOUSES AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS IN EXCHANGE FOR DAYS UNCURSED BY PANIC AND NIGHTS UNPOLLUTED BY BLOOD NOTHING I CAN TAKE UPON MYSELF TO ASSERT
6019-3185-0007 IN EVERY ONE OF WHICH THESE PRECAUTIONARY AIDS HAD FAILED TO YIELD THE SLIGHTEST ASSISTANCE THE HORROR THE PERFECT FRENZY OF FEAR WHICH SEIZED UPON THE TOWN AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE BAFFLES ALL ATTEMPT AT DESCRIPTION
6019-3185-0008 THE ASTOUNDED POLICE AFTER AN EXAMINATION THE MOST SEARCHING PURSUED FROM DAY TO DAY
6019-3185-0009 HAD FINALLY PRONOUNCED THAT NO ATTEMPT APPARENTLY HAD BEEN MADE TO BENEFIT BY ANY OF THE SIGNALS PRECONCERTED THAT NO FOOTSTEP APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION THEN AND AFTER THAT RESULT
6019-3185-0010 AND THE GENERAL FEELING AS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME BY A GRAVE CITIZEN WHOM I MET IN A MORNING WALK FOR THE OVERMASTERING SENSE OF A PUBLIC CALAMITY BROKE DOWN EVERY BARRIER OF RESERVE AND ALL MEN TALKED FREELY TO ALL MEN IN THE STREETS
6019-3185-0011 AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE ROCKINGS OF AN EARTHQUAKE WAS EVEN AMONG THE BOLDEST LIKE THAT WHICH SOMETIMES TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MIND IN DREAMS WHEN ONE FEELS ONESELF SLEEPING ALONE UTTERLY DIVIDED FROM ALL CALL OR HEARING OF FRIENDS
6019-3185-0012 DOORS OPEN THAT SHOULD BE SHUT OR UNLOCKED THAT SHOULD BE TRIPLY SECURED THE VERY WALLS GONE BARRIERS SWALLOWED UP BY UNKNOWN ABYSSES NOTHING AROUND ONE BUT FRAIL CURTAINS AND A WORLD OF ILLIMITABLE NIGHT
6019-3185-0013 WHISPERINGS AT A DISTANCE CORRESPONDENCE GOING ON BETWEEN DARKNESS AND DARKNESS LIKE ONE DEEP CALLING TO ANOTHER AND THE DREAMER'S OWN HEART THE CENTER FROM WHICH THE WHOLE NETWORK OF THIS UNIMAGINABLE CHAOS RADIATES
6019-3185-0014 AND IN WHICH THE HEART BEATS IN CONSCIOUS SYMPATHY WITH AN ENTIRE CITY THROUGH ALL ITS REGIONS OF HIGH AND LOW YOUNG AND OLD STRONG AND WEAK SUCH AGENCIES AVAIL TO RAISE AND TRANSFIGURE THE NATURES OF MEN
6019-3185-0015 IN THAT RESPECT THEREFORE I HAD AN ADVANTAGE BEING UPON THE SPOT THROUGH THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE AFFAIR FOR GIVING A FAITHFUL NARRATIVE AS I HAD STILL MORE EMINENTLY FROM THE SORT OF CENTRAL STATION WHICH I OCCUPIED
6019-3185-0016 WITH RESPECT TO ALL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CASE I MAY ADD THAT I HAD ANOTHER ADVANTAGE NOT POSSESSED OR NOT IN THE SAME DEGREE BY ANY OTHER INHABITANT OF THE TOWN I WAS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH EVERY FAMILY OF THE SLIGHTEST ACCOUNT BELONGING TO THE RESIDENT POPULATION
6019-3185-0017 A NOBLEMAN CONNECTED WITH THE DIPLOMACY OF RUSSIA FROM WHICH I QUOTE AN EXTRACT I WISH IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTIONS AND IN TERMS STRONGER THAN I KNOW HOW TO DEVISE
6019-3185-0018 A YOUNG MAN ON WHOSE BEHALF THE CZAR HIMSELF IS PRIVATELY KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED THE VERY STRONGEST INTEREST HE WAS AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AS AN AIDE DE CAMP TO A DUTCH GENERAL OFFICER AND IS DECORATED WITH DISTINCTIONS WON UPON THAT AWFUL DAY
6019-3185-0019 HOWEVER THOUGH SERVING IN THAT INSTANCE UNDER ENGLISH ORDERS AND ALTHOUGH AN ENGLISHMAN OF RANK HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE ENGLISH MILITARY SERVICE HE HAS SERVED YOUNG AS HE IS
6019-3185-0020 WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR HIS SOMEWHAT MOORISH COMPLEXION THOUGH AFTER ALL THAT IS NOT OF A DEEPER TINGE THAN I HAVE SEEN AMONG MANY AN ENGLISHMAN HE IS HIMSELF ONE OF THE NOBLEST LOOKING OF GOD'S CREATURES
6019-3185-0021 MISTER WYNDHAM'S SUCCESSION TO THE VAST FAMILY ESTATES IS INEVITABLE AND PROBABLY NEAR AT HAND MEANTIME HE IS ANXIOUS FOR SOME ASSISTANCE IN HIS STUDIES INTELLECTUALLY
6019-3185-0022 AS I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE SLOW TO DISCOVER BUT HIS LONG MILITARY SERVICE AND THE UNPARALLELED TUMULT OF OUR EUROPEAN HISTORY SINCE EIGHTEEN O FIVE HAVE INTERFERED AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE WITH THE CULTIVATION OF HIS MIND
6019-3185-0023 FOR HE ENTERED THE CAVALRY SERVICE OF A GERMAN POWER WHEN A MERE BOY AND SHIFTED ABOUT FROM SERVICE TO SERVICE AS THE HURRICANE OF WAR BLEW FROM THIS POINT OR FROM THAT
6019-3185-0024 AND TEN YEARS HENCE YOU WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HAVING CONTRIBUTED YOUR PART TO THE FORMATION OF ONE WHOM ALL HERE AT SAINT PETERSBURG NOT SOLDIERS ONLY BUT WE DIPLOMATES LOOK UPON AS CERTAIN TO PROVE A GREAT MAN
6019-3185-0025 HE WAS TO KEEP A TABLE AND AN ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS AT HIS OWN COST WAS TO HAVE AN APARTMENT OF SOME DOZEN OR SO OF ROOMS THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF THE LIBRARY WITH SOME OTHER PUBLIC PRIVILEGES WILLINGLY CONCEDED BY THE MAGISTRACY OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0026 THAT ALL WAS CLOSED BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND WHEN ONCE THAT CONSUMMATION WAS ATTAINED I THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BREATHED NO SYLLABLE OF WHAT WAS STIRRING NOW GAVE LOOSE TO THE INTERESTING TIDINGS AND SUFFERED THEM TO SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE COMPASS OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0027 IT WILL BE EASILY IMAGINED THAT SUCH A STORY ALREADY ROMANTIC ENOUGH IN ITS FIRST OUTLINE WOULD LOSE NOTHING IN THE TELLING AN ENGLISHMAN TO BEGIN WITH WHICH NAME OF ITSELF AND AT ALL TIMES IS A PASSPORT INTO GERMAN FAVOR
6019-3185-0028 NEXT AN ENGLISHMAN OF RANK
6019-3185-0029 THEN A SOLDIER COVERED WITH BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS AND IN THE MOST BRILLIANT ARM OF THE SERVICE YOUNG MOREOVER AND YET A VETERAN BY HIS EXPERIENCE FRESH FROM THE MOST AWFUL BATTLE OF THIS PLANET SINCE THE DAY OF PHARSALIA
6019-3185-0030 RADIANT WITH THE FAVOR OF COURTS AND OF IMPERIAL LADIES
6019-3185-0031 AN ANTINOUS OF FAULTLESS BEAUTY A GRECIAN STATUE AS IT WERE INTO WHICH THE BREATH OF LIFE HAD BEEN BREATHED BY SOME MODERN PYGMALION SUCH A POMP OF GIFTS AND ENDOWMENTS SETTLING UPON ONE MAN'S HEAD
6019-3185-0032 ON HIS ARRIVAL AT MY HOUSE I BECAME SENSIBLE OF A TRUTH WHICH I HAD OBSERVED SOME YEARS BEFORE THE COMMONPLACE MAXIM IS THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO RAISE EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH THIS
6019-3185-0033 WHICH IS THUS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AND WITHOUT LIMITATION IS TRUE ONLY CONDITIONALLY IT IS TRUE THEN AND THERE ONLY WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE MERIT TO SUSTAIN AND JUSTIFY THE EXPECTATION BUT IN ANY CASE WHERE THE MERIT IS TRANSCENDENT OF ITS KIND
6019-3185-0034 IT IS ALWAYS USEFUL TO RACK THE EXPECTATION UP TO THE HIGHEST POINT IN ANYTHING WHICH PARTAKES OF THE INFINITE THE MOST UNLIMITED EXPECTATIONS WILL FIND AMPLE ROOM FOR GRATIFICATION WHILE IT IS CERTAIN THAT ORDINARY OBSERVERS POSSESSING LITTLE SENSIBILITY
6019-3185-0035 THE WARNING AT ANY RATE PUT ME ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WHATEVER EMINENCE THERE MIGHT BE OF GRANDEUR IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THIS EXISTED IN SUCH EXCESS SO FAR TRANSCENDING ANYTHING I HAD EVER MET WITH IN MY EXPERIENCE
6019-3185-0036 THAT NO EXPECTATION WHICH IT IS IN WORDS TO RAISE COULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED THESE THOUGHTS TRAVELED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHT THROUGH MY BRAIN AS AT ONE GLANCE MY EYE TOOK IN THE SUPREMACY OF BEAUTY AND POWER
6019-3185-0037 WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ALIGHTED FROM THE CLOUDS BEFORE ME POWER AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF POWER IN ANY ABSOLUTE INCARNATION OF GRANDEUR OR EXCESS
6019-3185-0038 UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND DISTINCTION IN REALITY HIS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE HIS MILITARY HONORS AND THE DIGNITY OF HIS CHARACTER AS EXPRESSED IN HIS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT
6019-3185-0039 WERE TOO EMINENT TO ALLOW OF HIS BEING TREATED WITH LESS THAN THE HIGHEST ATTENTION IN ANY SOCIETY WHATEVER BUT THE EFFECT OF THESE VARIOUS ADVANTAGES ENFORCED AND RECOMMENDED AS THEY WERE BY A PERSONAL BEAUTY SO RARE
6019-3185-0040 WAS SOMEWHAT TOO POTENT FOR THE COMFORT AND SELF POSSESSION OF ORDINARY PEOPLE AND REALLY EXCEEDED IN A PAINFUL DEGREE THE STANDARD OF PRETENSIONS UNDER WHICH SUCH PEOPLE COULD FEEL THEMSELVES AT THEIR EASE HE WAS NOT NATURALLY OF A RESERVED TURN
6019-3185-0041 HAD COMMUNICATED TO HIS MANNERS A MORE THAN MILITARY FRANKNESS BUT THE PROFOUND MELANCHOLY WHICH POSSESSED HIM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE IT AROSE NECESSARILY CHILLED THE NATIVE FREEDOM OF HIS DEMEANOR
6019-3185-0042 UNLESS WHEN IT WAS REVIVED BY STRENGTH OF FRIENDSHIP OR OF LOVE THE EFFECT WAS AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING TO ALL PARTIES EVERY VOICE PAUSED OR FALTERED WHEN HE ENTERED A ROOM DEAD SILENCE ENSUED
6019-3185-0043 NOT AN EYE BUT WAS DIRECTED UPON HIM OR ELSE SUNK IN TIMIDITY SETTLED UPON THE FLOOR AND YOUNG LADIES SERIOUSLY LOST THE POWER FOR A TIME OF DOING MORE THAN MURMURING A FEW CONFUSED HALF INARTICULATE SYLLABLES
6019-3185-0044 EITHER AS ACTORS OR SPECTATORS CERTAINLY THIS RESULT WAS NOT A PURE EFFECT OF MANLY BEAUTY HOWEVER HEROIC AND IN WHATEVER EXCESS IT AROSE IN PART FROM THE MANY AND EXTRAORDINARY ENDOWMENTS WHICH HAD CENTERED IN HIS PERSON
6019-3185-0045 WERE THERE THEN NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS CONDITION OF AWESTRUCK ADMIRATION YES
6019-3185-0046 NEVER WAS THERE SO VICTORIOUS A CONQUEST INTERCHANGED BETWEEN TWO YOUTHFUL HEARTS NEVER BEFORE SUCH A RAPTURE OF INSTANTANEOUS SYMPATHY I DID NOT WITNESS THE FIRST MEETING OF THIS MYSTERIOUS MAXIMILIAN AND THIS MAGNIFICENT MARGARET
6019-3185-0047 AND DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MARGARET MANIFESTED THAT TREPIDATION AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH DISTRESSED SO MANY OF HER YOUTHFUL CO RIVALS BUT IF SHE DID IT MUST HAVE FLED BEFORE THE FIRST GLANCE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S EYE WHICH WOULD INTERPRET PAST ALL MISUNDERSTANDING
6019-3185-0048 ON THE PART OF MARGARET IT SEEMED AS IF A NEW WORLD HAD DAWNED UPON HER THAT SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS SUSPECTED AMONG THE CAPACITIES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE LIKE SOME BIRD SHE SEEMED WITH POWERS UNEXERCISED FOR SOARING AND FLYING
6019-3185-0049 AND FOR A MERE POSSIBILITY WHICH HE HAD LONG TOO DEEPLY CONTEMPLATED FEARING HOWEVER THAT IN HIS OWN CASE IT MIGHT PROVE A CHIMERA OR THAT HE MIGHT NEVER MEET A WOMAN ANSWERING THE DEMANDS OF HIS HEART HE NOW FOUND A CORRESPONDING REALITY THAT LEFT NOTHING TO SEEK
6019-3185-0050 HERE THEN AND THUS FAR NOTHING BUT HAPPINESS HAD RESULTED FROM THE NEW ARRANGEMENT BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN LITTLE ANTICIPATED BY MANY FAR LESS HAD I FOR MY PART ANTICIPATED THE UNHAPPY REVOLUTION WHICH WAS WROUGHT IN THE WHOLE NATURE
6019-3185-0051 WHO HAD DIED IN GIVING BIRTH TO THIS THIRD CHILD THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD LONG SURVIVED HER ANXIOUS THAT HIS SON SHOULD GO THROUGH A REGULAR COURSE OF MATHEMATICAL INSTRUCTION NOW BECOMING ANNUALLY MORE IMPORTANT IN ALL THE ARTILLERY SERVICES THROUGHOUT EUROPE
6019-3185-0052 AND THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE A TINCTURE OF OTHER LIBERAL STUDIES WHICH HE HAD PAINFULLY MISSED IN HIS OWN MILITARY CAREER THE BARON CHOSE TO KEEP HIS SON FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AT OUR COLLEGE UNTIL HE WAS NOW ENTERING UPON HIS TWENTY THIRD YEAR
6019-3185-0053 FOR THE FOUR LAST HE HAD LIVED WITH ME AS THE SOLE PUPIL WHOM I HAD OR MEANT TO HAVE HAD NOT THE BRILLIANT PROPOSALS OF THE YOUNG RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN PERSUADED ME TO BREAK MY RESOLUTION FERDINAND VON HARRELSTEIN HAD GOOD TALENTS
6019-3185-0054 NOT DAZZLING BUT RESPECTABLE AND SO AMIABLE WERE HIS TEMPER AND MANNERS THAT I HAD INTRODUCED HIM EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE HE WAS A FAVORITE AND EVERYWHERE INDEED EXCEPT EXACTLY THERE WHERE ONLY IN THIS WORLD HE CARED FOR FAVOR
6019-3185-0055 SHE IT WAS WHOM HE LOVED AND HAD LOVED FOR YEARS WITH THE WHOLE ARDOR OF HIS ARDENT SOUL SHE IT WAS FOR WHOM OR AT WHOSE COMMAND HE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DIED EARLY HE HAD FELT THAT IN HER HANDS LAY HIS DESTINY
6019-3185-0056 THAT SHE IT WAS WHO MUST BE HIS GOOD OR HIS EVIL GENIUS AT FIRST AND PERHAPS TO THE LAST I PITIED HIM EXCEEDINGLY BUT MY PITY SOON CEASED TO BE MINGLED WITH RESPECT
6019-3185-0057 AND THE SOLE RESOURCE FOR HIM AS I SAID OFTEN WAS TO QUIT THE CITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE PURSUITS OF ENTERPRISE OF AMBITION OR OF SCIENCE BUT HE HEARD ME AS A SOMNAMBULIST MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
6019-3185-0058 STARTING FEARFUL AGITATED SOMETIMES HE BROKE OUT INTO MANIACAL MOVEMENTS OF WRATH INVOKING SOME ABSENT PERSON PRAYING BESEECHING MENACING SOME AIR WOVE PHANTOM
6019-3185-0059 FOR MORE THAN I SAW ENOUGH TO FEAR SOME FEARFUL CATASTROPHE LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION SAID HIS CONFESSOR TO HIM IN MY HEARING FOR THOUGH PRUSSIANS THE VON HARRELSTEINS WERE ROMAN CATHOLICS LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION
6019-3185-0060 REVEREND FATHER DO NOT YOU WITH THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING ME FROM TEMPTATION BE YOURSELF THE INSTRUMENT FOR TEMPTING ME INTO A REBELLION AGAINST THE CHURCH DO NOT YOU WEAVE SNARES ABOUT MY STEPS SNARES THERE ARE ALREADY AND BUT TOO MANY
6019-3185-0061 THE OLD MAN SIGHED AND DESISTED THEN CAME BUT ENOUGH FROM PITY FROM SYMPATHY FROM COUNSEL AND FROM CONSOLATION AND FROM SCORN
6019-3185-0062 WHOSE CONVENT STOOD NEAR THE CITY GATES THERE GOES ONE READY EQUALLY FOR DOING OR SUFFERING AND OF WHOM WE SHALL SOON HEAR THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN SOME GREAT CATASTROPHE IT MAY BE OF DEEP CALAMITY
6019-3185-0063 FOR THE COSTLINESS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF OFFICIAL PRIDE DONE IN HONOR OF THE CITY NOT AS AN EFFORT OF PERSONAL DISPLAY IT FOLLOWED FROM THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THESE HALF YEARLY DANCES ORIGINATED
6019-3185-0064 THAT BEING GIVEN ON THE PART OF THE CITY EVERY STRANGER OF RANK WAS MARKED OUT AS A PRIVILEGED GUEST AND THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY AFFRONTED BY FAILING TO OFFER OR BY FAILING TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION
6019-3185-0065 UPON THE EVENING AT WHICH I AM NOW ARRIVED THE TWENTY SECOND OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN THE WHOLE CITY IN ITS WEALTHIER CLASSES WAS ASSEMBLED BENEATH THE ROOF OF A TRADESMAN WHO HAD THE HEART OF A PRINCE
6019-3185-0066 IN EVERY POINT OUR ENTERTAINMENT WAS SUPERB AND I REMARKED THAT THE MUSIC WAS THE FINEST I HAD HEARD FOR YEARS OUR HOST WAS IN JOYOUS SPIRITS PROUD TO SURVEY THE SPLENDID COMPANY HE HAD GATHERED UNDER HIS ROOF
6019-3185-0067 HAPPY TO WITNESS THEIR HAPPINESS ELATED IN THEIR ELATION JOYOUS WAS THE DANCE JOYOUS WERE ALL FACES THAT I SAW UP TO MIDNIGHT VERY SOON AFTER WHICH TIME SUPPER WAS ANNOUNCED
6019-3185-0068 AND THAT ALSO I THINK WAS THE MOST JOYOUS OF ALL THE BANQUETS I EVER WITNESSED THE ACCOMPLISHED GUARDSMAN OUTSHONE HIMSELF IN BRILLIANCY EVEN HIS MELANCHOLY RELAXED IN FACT HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE
6019-3185-0069 HANGING UPON HIS WORDS MORE LUSTROUS AND BEWITCHING THAN EVER I HAD BEHELD HER THERE SHE HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE HOST AND EVERYBODY KNEW WHY THAT IS ONE OF THE LUXURIES ATTACHED TO LOVE ALL MEN CEDE THEIR PLACES WITH PLEASURE
6019-3185-0070 WOMEN MAKE WAY EVEN SHE HERSELF KNEW THOUGH NOT OBLIGED TO KNOW WHY SHE WAS SEATED IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND TOOK HER PLACE IF WITH A ROSY SUFFUSION UPON HER CHEEKS YET WITH FULLNESS OF HAPPINESS AT HER HEART
6019-3185-0071 THE MUSIC AGAIN BEGAN TO POUR ITS VOLUPTUOUS TIDES THROUGH THE BOUNDING PULSES OF THE YOUTHFUL COMPANY AGAIN THE FLYING FEET OF THE DANCERS BEGAN TO RESPOND TO THE MEASURES
6019-3185-0072 AGAIN THE MOUNTING SPIRIT OF DELIGHT BEGAN TO FILL THE SAILS OF THE HURRYING NIGHT WITH STEADY INSPIRATION ALL WENT HAPPILY ALREADY HAD ONE DANCE FINISHED SOME WERE PACING UP AND DOWN LEANING ON THE ARMS OF THEIR PARTNERS
6019-3185-0073 SOME WERE REPOSING FROM THEIR EXERTIONS WHEN O HEAVENS WHAT A SHRIEK WHAT A GATHERING TUMULT EVERY EYE WAS BENT TOWARD THE DOORS EVERY EYE STRAINED FORWARD TO DISCOVER WHAT WAS PASSING
6019-3185-0074 BUT THERE EVERY MOMENT LESS AND LESS COULD BE SEEN FOR THE GATHERING CROWD MORE AND MORE INTERCEPTED THE VIEW SO MUCH THE MORE WAS THE EAR AT LEISURE FOR THE SHRIEKS REDOUBLED UPON SHRIEKS MISS LIEBENHEIM HAD MOVED DOWNWARD TO THE CROWD
6019-3185-0075 AND HAD LIVED WITH HER UNCLE A TRADESMAN NOT TEN DOORS FROM MARGARET'S OWN RESIDENCE PARTLY ON THE TERMS OF A KINSWOMAN PARTLY AS A SERVANT ON TRIAL AT THIS MOMENT SHE WAS EXHAUSTED WITH EXCITEMENT AND THE NATURE OF THE SHOCK SHE HAD SUSTAINED
6019-3185-0076 MERE PANIC SEEMED TO HAVE MASTERED HER AND SHE WAS LEANING UNCONSCIOUS AND WEEPING UPON THE SHOULDER OF SOME GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ENDEAVORING TO SOOTHE HER A SILENCE OF HORROR SEEMED TO POSSESS THE COMPANY
6019-3185-0077 MOST OF WHOM WERE STILL UNACQUAINTED WITH THE CAUSE OF THE ALARMING INTERRUPTION A FEW HOWEVER WHO HAD HEARD HER FIRST AGITATED WORDS
6019-3185-0078 NOW RUSHED TUMULTUOUSLY OUT OF THE BALLROOM TO SATISFY THEMSELVES ON THE SPOT THE DISTANCE WAS NOT GREAT AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SEVERAL PERSONS RETURNED HASTILY AND CRIED OUT TO THE CROWD OF LADIES THAT ALL WAS TRUE WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL HAD SAID
6019-3185-0079 WHAT WAS TRUE THAT HER UNCLE MISTER WEISHAUPT'S FAMILY HAD BEEN MURDERED THAT NOT ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY HAD BEEN SPARED NAMELY MISTER WEISHAUPT HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE NEITHER OF THEM MUCH ABOVE SIXTY
6019-3185-0080 BUT BOTH INFIRM BEYOND THEIR YEARS TWO MAIDEN SISTERS OF MISTER WEISHAUPT FROM FORTY TO FORTY SIX YEARS OF AGE AND AN ELDERLY FEMALE DOMESTIC
6019-3185-0081 AN INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING THE RECITAL OF THESE HORRORS AND OF THE DETAILS WHICH FOLLOWED THAT FURNISHED MATTER FOR CONVERSATION EVEN IN THESE HOURS WHEN SO THRILLING AN INTEREST HAD POSSESSION OF ALL MINDS MANY LADIES FAINTED AMONG THEM
6019-3185-0082 AND SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THE GROUND BUT FOR MAXIMILIAN WHO SPRANG FORWARD AND CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS SHE WAS LONG OF RETURNING TO HERSELF AND DURING THE AGONY OF HIS SUSPENSE HE STOOPED AND KISSED HER PALLID LIPS
6019-3185-0083 THAT SIGHT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE BORNE BY ONE WHO STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND THE GROUP HE RUSHED FORWARD WITH EYES GLARING LIKE A TIGER'S AND LEVELED A BLOW AT MAXIMILIAN IT WAS POOR MANIACAL VON HARRELSTEIN
6019-3185-0084 MANY PEOPLE STEPPED FORWARD AND CHECKED HIS ARM UPLIFTED FOR A REPETITION OF THIS OUTRAGE ONE OR TWO HAD SOME INFLUENCE WITH HIM AND LED HIM AWAY FROM THE SPOT
6019-3185-0085 WHILE AS TO MAXIMILIAN SO ABSORBED WAS HE THAT HE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS PERCEIVED THE AFFRONT OFFERED TO HIMSELF MARGARET ON REVIVING WAS CONFOUNDED AT FINDING HERSELF SO SITUATED AMID A GREAT CROWD
6019-3185-0086 AND YET THE PRUDES COMPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A LOOK OF LOVE EXCHANGED BETWEEN HERSELF AND MAXIMILIAN THAT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ESCAPED HER IN SUCH A SITUATION IF THEY MEANT BY SUCH A SITUATION ONE SO PUBLIC
6019-3185-0087 THAT IT WAS A SITUATION OF EXCESSIVE AGITATION BUT IF THEY ALLUDED TO THE HORRORS OF THE MOMENT NO SITUATION MORE NATURALLY OPENS THE HEART TO AFFECTION AND CONFIDING LOVE THAN THE RECOIL FROM SCENES OF EXQUISITE TERROR
6019-3185-0088 WERE MARKED BY THE COOLEST NAY THE MOST SNEERING INDIFFERENCE THE FIRST THING HE DID ON BEING ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUSPICIONS AGAINST HIMSELF WAS TO LAUGH FEROCIOUSLY AND TO ALL APPEARANCE MOST CORDIALLY AND UNAFFECTEDLY
6019-3185-0089 GOLD REPEATERS MASSY PLATE GOLD SNUFF BOXES UNTOUCHED THAT ARGUMENT CERTAINLY WEIGHED MUCH IN HIS FAVOR AND YET AGAIN IT WAS TURNED AGAINST HIM FOR A MAGISTRATE ASKED HIM HOW HE HAPPENED TO KNOW ALREADY THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TOUCHED
6019-3185-0090 TRUE IT WAS AND A FACT WHICH HAD PUZZLED NO LESS THAN IT HAD AWED THE MAGISTRATES THAT UPON THEIR EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES MANY RICH ARTICLES OF BIJOUTERIE JEWELRY AND PERSONAL ORNAMENTS HAD BEEN FOUND LYING UNDERANGED
6019-3185-0091 FOR THE PRIVATE CELEBRATION OF MASS THIS CRUCIFIX AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE LITTLE CLOSET
6019-3185-0092 FOR HITHER HAD ONE OF THE LADIES FLED HITHER HAD ONE OF THE MURDERERS PURSUED SHE HAD CLASPED THE GOLDEN PILLARS WHICH SUPPORTED THE ALTAR HAD TURNED PERHAPS HER DYING LOOKS UPON THE CRUCIFIX
6019-3185-0093 FOR THERE WITH ONE ARM STILL WREATHED ABOUT THE ALTAR FOOT THOUGH IN HER AGONY SHE HAD TURNED ROUND UPON HER FACE DID THE ELDER SISTER LIE WHEN THE MAGISTRATES FIRST BROKE OPEN THE STREET DOOR AND UPON THE BEAUTIFUL PARQUET
6019-3185-0094 OR INLAID FLOOR WHICH RAN ROUND THE ROOM WERE STILL IMPRESSED THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MURDERER THESE IT WAS HOPED MIGHT FURNISH A CLEW TO THE DISCOVERY OF ONE AT LEAST AMONG THE MURDEROUS BAND THEY WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO TRACE ACCURATELY
6019-3185-0095 THOSE PARTS OF THE TRACES WHICH LAY UPON THE BLACK TESSELLAE BEING LESS DISTINCT IN THE OUTLINE THAN THE OTHERS UPON THE WHITE OR COLORED MOST UNQUESTIONABLY SO FAR AS THIS WENT IT FURNISHED A NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOR OF THE NEGRO
6019-3185-0096 FOR THE FOOTSTEPS WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN OUTLINE FROM HIS AND SMALLER FOR AARON WAS A MAN OF COLOSSAL BUILD
6019-3185-0097 AND AS TO HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE PREMISES HAD BEEN FOUND AND HIS HAVING SO FAMILIARLY RELIED UPON THE FACT OF NO ROBBERY HAVING TAKEN PLACE AS AN ARGUMENT ON HIS OWN BEHALF
6019-3185-0098 HE CONTENDED THAT HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN AMONG THE CROWD THAT PUSHED INTO THE HOUSE ALONG WITH THE MAGISTRATES THAT FROM HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROOMS AND THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION
6019-3185-0099 THAT IN FACT HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH FOR HIS ARGUMENT BEFORE HE AND THE REST OF THE MOB HAD BEEN EJECTED BY THE MAGISTRATES BUT FINALLY THAT INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL THIS HE HAD HEARD BOTH THE OFFICERS AS THEY CONDUCTED HIM
6019-3185-0100 IN SIX WEEKS OR LESS FROM THE DATE OF THIS TERRIFIC EVENT THE NEGRO WAS SET AT LIBERTY BY A MAJORITY OF VOICES AMONG THE MAGISTRATES IN THAT SHORT INTERVAL OTHER EVENTS HAD OCCURRED NO LESS TERRIFIC AND MYSTERIOUS
6019-3185-0101 ATTACKED THEM SINGLY IN FLIGHT FOR IN THIS FIRST CASE ALL BUT ONE OF THE MURDERED PERSONS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THE STREET DOOR AND IN ALL THIS THERE WAS NO SUBJECT FOR WONDER EXCEPT THE ORIGINAL ONE AS TO THE MOTIVE
6019-3185-0102 IN SAD LEISURELY OR IN TERRIFIC GROUPS SEEMED TO ARGUE A LETHARGY LIKE THAT OF APOPLEXY IN THE VICTIMS ONE AND ALL THE VERY MIDNIGHT OF MYSTERIOUS AWE FELL UPON ALL MINDS
6019-3185-0103 THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED SINCE THE MURDER AT MISTER WEISHAUPT'S THREE WEEKS THE MOST AGITATED THAT HAD BEEN KNOWN IN THIS SEQUESTERED CITY WE FELT OURSELVES SOLITARY AND THROWN UPON OUR OWN RESOURCES
6019-3185-0104 ALL COMBINATION WITH OTHER TOWNS BEING UNAVAILING FROM THEIR GREAT DISTANCE OUR SITUATION WAS NO ORDINARY ONE HAD THERE BEEN SOME MYSTERIOUS ROBBERS AMONG US THE CHANCES OF A VISIT DIVIDED AMONG SO MANY
6019-3185-0105 WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SMALL TO DISTRESS THE MOST TIMID WHILE TO YOUNG AND HIGH SPIRITED PEOPLE WITH COURAGE TO SPARE FOR ORDINARY TRIALS
6019-3185-0106 BUT MURDERERS EXTERMINATING MURDERERS CLOTHED IN MYSTERY AND UTTER DARKNESS THESE WERE OBJECTS TOO TERRIFIC FOR ANY FAMILY TO CONTEMPLATE WITH FORTITUDE
6019-3185-0107 HAD THESE VERY MURDERERS ADDED TO THEIR FUNCTIONS THOSE OF ROBBERY THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME LESS TERRIFIC
6019-3185-0108 FROM THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO A VISIT WHILE SUCH AS KNEW THEMSELVES LIABLE WOULD HAVE HAD WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN THE FACT OF BEING RICH AND WOULD FROM THE VERY RICHES WHICH CONSTITUTED THAT DANGER HAVE DERIVED THE MEANS OF REPELLING IT BUT AS THINGS WERE
6019-3185-0109 NO MAN COULD GUESS WHAT IT WAS THAT MUST MAKE HIM OBNOXIOUS TO THE MURDERERS IMAGINATION EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN VAIN GUESSES AT THE CAUSES WHICH COULD BY POSSIBILITY HAVE MADE THE POOR WEISHAUPTS OBJECTS OF SUCH HATRED TO ANY MAN
6019-3185-0110 TRUE THEY WERE BIGOTED IN A DEGREE WHICH INDICATED FEEBLENESS OF INTELLECT BUT THAT WOUNDED NO MAN IN PARTICULAR WHILE TO MANY IT RECOMMENDED THEM TRUE THEIR CHARITY WAS NARROW AND EXCLUSIVE BUT TO THOSE OF THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BODY IT EXPANDED MUNIFICENTLY
6019-3185-0111 AND BEING RICH BEYOND THEIR WANTS OR ANY MEANS OF EMPLOYING WEALTH WHICH THEIR GLOOMY ASCETICISM ALLOWED THEY HAD THE POWER OF DOING A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AMONG THE INDIGENT PAPISTS OF THE SUBURBS
5789-57195-0000 PROVIDENCE INTERFERES THE BATTLE WAS CARRIED ON VERY FIERCELY IN MISTER MASTERS HOUSE IN DILLSBOROUGH TO THE MISERY OF ALL WITHIN IT
5789-57195-0001 THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN INTENSELY ANXIOUS FOR THE MARRIAGE WISHING TO HAVE LARRY FOR A BROTHER LOOKING FORWARD WITH DELIGHT TO THEIR SHARE IN THE UNRESTRICTED PLENTEOUSNESS OF CHOWTON FARM
5789-57195-0002 THEY COULD QUARREL WITH THEIR ELDER SISTER WHILE THE ASSURANCE WAS STILL WITH THEM THAT SHE WOULD BE THERE TO FORGIVE THEM BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY AND THAT IT HAD COME TO BE BELIEVED BY BOTH OF THEM THAT POOR LAWRENCE HAD NO CHANCE
5789-57195-0003 THEY WERE SAD AND DOWNHEARTED IN ALL THAT MISERY THE POOR ATTORNEY HAD THE WORST OF IT MARY WAS FREE FROM HER STEPMOTHER'S ZEAL AND HER STEPMOTHER'S PERSECUTION AT ANY RATE AT NIGHT
5789-57195-0004 BUT THE POOR FATHER WAS HARDLY ALLOWED TO SLEEP FOR MISSUS MASTERS NEVER GAVE UP HER GAME AS ALTOGETHER LOST THOUGH SHE MIGHT BE DRIVEN ALTERNATELY INTO TOWERING PASSION AND PROSTRATE HYSTERICS
5789-57195-0005 SHE WOULD STILL COME AGAIN TO THE BATTLE A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD SHE SAID BRING LARRY TWENTYMAN BACK TO HIS COURTSHIP AND THAT WORD MIGHT BE SPOKEN IF MARY'S VISIT TO CHELTENHAM WERE FORBIDDEN
5789-57195-0006 LET MARY ONCE BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE A FINE LADY AND THEN SHE WOULD MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN QUICK ENOUGH BUT THIS USHANTING THIS JOURNEYING TO CHELTENHAM IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE DONE
5789-57195-0007 WAS THE VERY WAY TO PROMOTE THE DISEASE THIS MISSUS MASTERS SAID IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON NIGHT AND DAY TILL THE POOR HUSBAND LONGED FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S DEPARTURE
5789-57195-0008 IN ALL THESE DISPUTES HE NEVER QUITE YIELDED THOUGH HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM HE WAS STILL FIRM HE WOULD TURN HIS BACK TO HIS WIFE AND LET HER RUN ON WITH HER ARGUMENTS WITHOUT A WORD OF ANSWER
5789-57195-0009 BUT AT LAST THERE CAME TO HER A GLEAM OF HOPE MOST UNEXPECTEDLY IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT MARY SHOULD MAKE HER JOURNEY ON FRIDAY THE TWELFTH FEBRUARY AND THAT REGINALD MORTON WAS AGAIN TO ACCOMPANY HER
5789-57195-0010 WHICH WAS IN ITSELF OF ALL THINGS THE MOST PERNICIOUS IF MARY MUST GO TO CHELTENHAM WHY COULD SHE NOT GO BY HERSELF SECOND CLASS LIKE ANY OTHER YOUNG WOMAN
5789-57195-0011 NOBODY WOULD EAT HER MISSUS MASTERS DECLARED BUT REGINALD WAS FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF ACCOMPANYING HER HE HAD NO OBJECTION WHATEVER TO THE SECOND CLASS IF MISTER MASTERS PREFERRED IT
5789-57195-0012 THEN THERE CAME A SUDDEN DISRUPTION TO ALL THESE PLANS AND A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HER HOPES TO MISSUS MASTERS
5789-57195-0013 LADY USHANT WROTE TO POSTPONE THE VISIT BECAUSE SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO BRAGTON HER LETTER TO MARY THOUGH AFFECTIONATE WAS VERY SHORT HER GRAND NEPHEW JOHN THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
5789-57195-0014 HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE HER AND WITH THAT WISH SHE WAS BOUND TO COMPLY OF COURSE SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE MARY AT BRAGTON OR IF THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE SHE HERSELF WOULD COME INTO DILLSBOROUGH
5789-57195-0015 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE THE LENGTH OF HER VISIT BUT WHEN IT WAS OVER SHE HOPED THAT MARY WOULD RETURN WITH HER TO CHELTENHAM THE OLD LADY'S LETTER TO REGINALD WAS MUCH LONGER BECAUSE IN THAT SHE HAD TO SPEAK OF THE STATE OF JOHN MORTON'S HEALTH
5789-57195-0016 AND OF HER SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD BE SUMMONED TO HIS BEDSIDE OF COURSE SHE WOULD GO THOUGH SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD WITH SATISFACTION TO A MEETING WITH THE HONBLE MISSUS MORTON
5789-57195-0017 THEN SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ALLUDING TO THE FACT THAT IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO JOHN MORTON REGINALD HIMSELF WOULD BE THE SQUIRE OF BRAGTON REGINALD WHEN HE RECEIVED THIS AT ONCE WENT OVER TO THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE
5789-57195-0018 BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN SEEING MARY HE LEARNED HOWEVER THAT THEY WERE ALL AWARE THAT THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO MISSUS MASTERS IT SEEMED THAT ALL THIS HAD BEEN A DISPENSATION OF PROVIDENCE
5789-57195-0019 LADY USHANT'S LETTER HAD BEEN RECEIVED ON THE THURSDAY AND MISSUS MASTERS AT ONCE FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO COMMUNICATE WITH LARRY TWENTYMAN SHE WAS NOT EXCELLENT HERSELF AT THE WRITING OF LETTERS AND THEREFORE SHE GOT DOLLY TO BE THE SCRIBE
5789-57195-0020 WHEN THIS WAS RECEIVED THE POOR MAN WAS SMOKING HIS MOODY PIPE IN SILENCE AS HE ROAMED ABOUT HIS OWN FARMYARD IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
5789-57195-0021 HE HAD NOT AS YET KNOWN ANY COMFORT AND WAS STILL FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF SELLING THE FARM HE HAD BEEN OUT HUNTING ONCE OR TWICE BUT FANCIED THAT PEOPLE LOOKED AT HIM WITH PECULIAR EYES
5789-57195-0022 HE DID NOT CARE IN THE LEAST WHETHER THEY FOUND OR NOT AND WHEN CAPTAIN GLOMAX WAS HELD TO HAVE DISGRACED HIMSELF THOROUGHLY BY WASTING AN HOUR IN DIGGING OUT AND THEN KILLING A VIXEN HE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY ABOUT IT
5789-57195-0023 BUT AS HE READ DOLLY'S NOTE THERE CAME BACK SOMETHING OF LIFE INTO HIS EYES HE HAD FORSWORN THE CLUB BUT WOULD CERTAINLY GO WHEN THUS INVITED HE WROTE A SCRAWL TO DOLLY I'LL COME
5789-57195-0024 AND HAVING SENT IT OFF BY THE MESSENGER TRIED TO TRUST THAT THERE MIGHT YET BE GROUND FOR HOPE MISSUS MASTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED DOLLY TO SEND SUCH A MESSAGE WITHOUT GOOD REASON
5789-57195-0025 JOHN MORTON MIGHT DIE AND THEN WHO COULD TELL WHETHER LADY USHANT WOULD EVER RETURN TO CHELTENHAM IN THIS WAY THE SHORT LIVED PEACE SOON CAME TO AN END ESPECIALLY AS MISSUS MASTERS ENDEAVOURED TO UTILIZE FOR GENERAL FAMILY PURPOSES
5789-57195-0026 ON THE SATURDAY LARRY CAME TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF MISTER MASTERS WHO WAS STILL IN HIS OFFICE AT HALF PAST SEVEN MISSUS MASTERS AT ONCE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND CONVEYED HIM AWAY INTO THE SACRED DRAWING ROOM
5789-57195-0027 MARY IS NOT GOING SHE SAID NOT GOING TO CHELTENHAM IT HAS ALL BEEN PUT OFF SHE SHAN'T GO AT ALL IF I CAN HELP IT BUT WHY HAS IT BEEN PUT OFF MISSUS MASTERS
5789-57195-0028 LADY USHANT IS COMING TO BRAGTON I SUPPOSE THAT POOR MAN IS DYING HE IS VERY ILL CERTAINLY
5789-57195-0029 I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS SUCH FRIENDS WITH THE SQUIRE AS THAT WELL THERE IT IS LADY USHANT IS COMING TO BRAGTON AND MARY IS NOT GOING TO CHELTENHAM
5789-57195-0030 THIS SHE SAID AS THOUGH THE NEWS MUST BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO LARRY TWENTYMAN HE STOOD FOR AWHILE SCRATCHING HIS HEAD AS HE THOUGHT OF IT
5789-57195-0031 AT LAST IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT MARY'S CONTINUAL RESIDENCE IN DILLSBOROUGH WOULD OF ITSELF HARDLY ASSIST HIM I DON'T SEE MISSUS MASTERS THAT THAT WILL MAKE HER A BIT KINDER TO ME
5789-57195-0032 LARRY DON'T YOU BE A COWARD NOR YET SOFT AS FOR COWARD MISSUS MASTERS I DON'T KNOW I SUPPOSE YOU REALLY DO LOVE THE GIRL I DO I THINK I'VE SHOWN THAT
5789-57195-0033 AND YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED YOUR MIND NOT A BIT THAT'S WHY I SPEAK OPEN TO YOU DON'T YOU BE AFRAID OF HER WHAT'S THE LETTER WHICH A GIRL LIKE THAT WRITES
5789-57195-0034 WHEN SHE GETS TANTRUMS INTO HER HEAD OF COURSE SHE'LL WRITE A LETTER BUT THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE MISSUS MASTERS WHO SAYS SO I SAY THERE AIN'T NOBODY NOBODY
5789-57195-0035 IF ANYBODY TELLS YOU THAT IT'S ONLY JUST TO PUT YOU OFF
5789-57195-0036 COME TO MORROW AND HAVE A GOSSIP WITH THE GIRLS TOGETHER AND SHOW THAT YOU CAN KEEP YOUR PLUCK UP THAT'S THE WAY TO WIN HER LARRY DID GO TO THE CLUB AND DID THINK VERY MUCH OF IT AS HE WALKED HOME
5789-57195-0037 HE HAD PROMISED TO COME ON THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON BUT HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO BELIEVE IN THAT THEORY OF BOOKS AND POETRY PUT FORWARD BY MISSUS MASTERS
5789-70653-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
5789-70653-0001 HE WAS A LARGE MAN OF JOVIAL TEMPER WITH A STRONG INTEREST IN THE DRAMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS WORK AND THE NEWS OF MANDERSON'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION HAD MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST CORONER IN ENGLAND
5789-70653-0002 THE COURT WAS HELD IN A LONG UNFURNISHED ROOM LATELY BUILT ONTO THE HOTEL AND INTENDED TO SERVE AS A BALL ROOM OR CONCERT HALL A REGIMENT OF REPORTERS WAS ENTRENCHED IN THE FRONT SEATS
5789-70653-0003 AND THOSE WHO WERE TO BE CALLED ON TO GIVE EVIDENCE OCCUPIED CHAIRS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE BEHIND WHICH THE CORONER SAT WHILE THE JURY IN DOUBLE ROW WITH PLASTERED HAIR AND A SPURIOUS EASE OF MANNER FLANKED HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5789-70653-0004 AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
5789-70653-0005 THE IDENTITY OF THE DEAD MAN WAS PROVED BY HIS WIFE THE FIRST WITNESS CALLED FROM WHOM THE CORONER AFTER SOME INQUIRY INTO THE HEALTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DECEASED
5789-70653-0006 PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
5789-70653-0007 WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
5789-70653-0008 PRODUCED A SINGULAR IMPRESSION THIS WAS NOT AN IMPRESSION OF HARDNESS INTERESTING FEMININITY WAS THE FIRST THING TO BE FELT IN HER PRESENCE SHE WAS NOT EVEN ENIGMATIC
5789-70653-0009 BUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT
5789-70653-0010 HIS ROOM WAS REALLY A DRESSING ROOM ATTACHED TO HER OWN BEDROOM COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WHICH WAS USUALLY KEPT OPEN DURING THE NIGHT BOTH DRESSING ROOM AND BEDROOM WERE ENTERED BY OTHER DOORS GIVING ON THE PASSAGE
5789-70653-0011 AND LIKED TO SLEEP IN A SMALL ROOM SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWAKE WHEN HE CAME UP BUT HAD BEEN HALF AROUSED AS USUALLY HAPPENED WHEN THE LIGHT WAS SWITCHED ON IN HER HUSBAND'S ROOM SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
5789-70653-0012 SHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CAR
5789-70653-0013 AND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WAS
5789-70653-0014 HE DID EXPLAIN WHY I REMEMBER VERY WELL WHAT HE SAID BECAUSE SHE STOPPED WITH A LITTLE APPEARANCE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE THE CORONER INSISTED GENTLY
5789-70653-0015 HE SAID THAT MISTER MARLOWE COULD DO IT QUITE EASILY IF HE HAD NO ACCIDENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD STARTED IN THE CAR AND THEN WALKED BACK HOME A MILE OR SO AND FELT ALL THE BETTER FOR IT DID HE SAY ANY MORE
5789-70653-0016 AND YOU HEARD NOTHING IN THE NIGHT NO I NEVER WOKE UNTIL MY MAID BROUGHT MY TEA IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEADING TO MY HUSBAND'S ROOM AS SHE ALWAYS DID
5789-70653-0017 AND I SUPPOSED HIM TO BE STILL THERE HE ALWAYS NEEDED A GREAT DEAL OF SLEEP HE SOMETIMES SLEPT UNTIL QUITE LATE IN THE MORNING I HAD BREAKFAST IN MY SITTING ROOM IT WAS ABOUT TEN WHEN I HEARD THAT MY HUSBAND'S BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
5789-70653-0018 THE WITNESS DROPPED HER HEAD AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER DISMISSAL BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE YET MISSUS MANDERSON THE CORONER'S VOICE WAS SYMPATHETIC BUT IT HAD A HINT OF FIRMNESS IN IT NOW
5789-70653-0019 THE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONE
5789-70653-0020 IS IT THE FACT THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH YOUR LATE HUSBAND HAD NOT BEEN FOR SOME TIME PAST RELATIONS OF MUTUAL AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE
5789-70653-0021 HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ANXIETY AND SORROW HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME VERY RESERVED AND SEEMED MISTRUSTFUL I SAW MUCH LESS OF HIM THAN BEFORE
5789-70653-0022 HE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHT
5789-70653-0023 SOMETHING WAS BETWEEN US I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AND HE NEVER TOLD ME MY OWN OBSTINATE PRIDE PREVENTED ME FROM ASKING WHAT IT WAS IN SO MANY WORDS
5789-70653-0024 I ONLY MADE A POINT OF BEING TO HIM EXACTLY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO FAR AS HE WOULD ALLOW ME I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS THE WITNESS WHOSE VOICE HAD TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HER SELF CONTROL
5789-70653-0025 THEN WAS THERE NEVER ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY CALL WORDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MA'AM NEVER
5789-70653-0026 THE WORD WAS COLORLESSLY SPOKEN BUT EVERYONE FELT THAT A CRASS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF CONDUCT IN THE CASE OF A PERSON LIKE MISSUS MANDERSON HAD BEEN VISITED WITH SOME SEVERITY DID SHE KNOW THE CORONER ASKED
5789-70653-0027 OF ANY OTHER MATTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREYING UPON HER HUSBAND'S MIND RECENTLY MISSUS MANDERSON KNEW OF NONE WHATEVER THE CORONER INTIMATED THAT HER ORDEAL WAS AT AN END AND THE VEILED LADY MADE HER WAY TO THE DOOR
5789-70653-0028 THE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOM
5789-70653-0029 BUT HE DID NOT LOOK AT MARTIN HE WAS OBSERVING THE WELL BALANCED FIGURE THAT CAME QUICKLY TOWARD HIM ALONG AN OPENING PATH IN THE CROWD AND HIS EYE WAS GLOOMY
5789-70653-0030 HE STARTED AS HE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE DOOR WITH A SLIGHT BOW TO HEAR MISSUS MANDERSON ADDRESS HIM BY NAME IN A LOW VOICE HE FOLLOWED HER A PACE OR TWO INTO THE HALL I WANTED TO ASK YOU
5789-70653-0031 SHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIR
5789-70653-0032 SHE COULD DRAG HIM FROM THE PLACE THEN AGAIN SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON IT AND WITH THAT SUPPORT AND WITH BENT HEAD SHE WALKED SLOWLY FROM THE HOTEL AND ALONG THE OAK SHADED PATH TOWARD WHITE GABLES
5789-70653-0033 RUSHED THROUGH HIS BRAIN IN A ROUT BUT THE TOUCH OF HER UNNERVED HAND UPON HIS ARM NEVER FOR AN INSTANT LEFT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS FILLING HIM WITH AN EXALTATION THAT ENRAGED AND BEWILDERED HIM
5789-70653-0034 HE WAS STILL CURSING HIMSELF FURIOUSLY BEHIND THE MASK OF CONVENTIONAL SOLICITUDE THAT HE TURNED TO THE LADY WHEN HE HAD ATTENDED HER TO THE HOUSE AND SEEN HER SINK UPON A COUCH IN THE MORNING ROOM
5789-70653-0035 WITH A LOOK OF SINCERE GRATITUDE IN HER EYES SHE WAS MUCH BETTER NOW SHE SAID AND A CUP OF TEA WOULD WORK A MIRACLE UPON HER SHE HOPED SHE HAD NOT TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM ANYTHING IMPORTANT SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HERSELF
5789-70653-0036 SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED THOSE LAST QUESTIONS I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT HEAR ME SHE SAID WHEN HE EXPLAINED BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL READ IT ALL IN THE REPORTS
7059-88364-0000 AROUND LOS ANGELES THE GREATEST AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC MOVING PICTURE COLONIES ARE BEING BUILT EACH PHOTOPLAY MAGAZINE HAS ITS CALIFORNIA LETTER TELLING OF THE PUTTING UP OF NEW STUDIOS AND THE TRANSFER OF ACTORS
7059-88364-0001 WITH MUCH SLAP YOU ON THE BACK PERSONAL GOSSIP THIS IS THE OUTGROWTH OF THE FACT THAT EVERY TYPE OF THE PHOTOPLAY BUT THE INTIMATE IS FOUNDED ON SOME PHASE OF THE OUT OF DOORS BEING THUS DEPENDENT
7059-88364-0002 THE PLANT CAN BEST BE SET UP WHERE THERE IS NO WINTER BESIDES THIS THE LOS ANGELES REGION HAS THE SEA THE MOUNTAINS THE DESERT AND MANY KINDS OF GROVE AND FIELD LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE ARE SUB TROPICAL
7059-88364-0003 BUT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CALIFORNIA ASK ANY TRAVELLER OR STUDY THE BACKGROUND OF ALMOST ANY PHOTOPLAY IF THE PHOTOPLAY IS THE CONSISTENT UTTERANCE OF ITS SCENES IF THE ACTORS ARE INCARNATIONS OF THE LAND THEY WALK UPON
7059-88364-0004 AS THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA INDEED STANDS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE FILMS AN UTTERANCE OF HER OWN WILL THIS LAND FURTHEST WEST BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE INNER SPIRIT OF THIS NEWEST AND MOST CURIOUS OF THE ARTS
7059-88364-0005 ALREADY THE CALIFORNIA SORT IN THE COMMERCIAL CHANNELS HAS BECOME THE BROADLY ACCEPTED IF MEDIOCRE NATIONAL FORM PEOPLE WHO REVERE THE PILGRIM FATHERS OF SIXTEEN TWENTY
7059-88364-0006 HAVE OFTEN WISHED THOSE GENTLEMEN HAD MOORED THEIR BARK IN THE REGION OF LOS ANGELES RATHER THAN PLYMOUTH ROCK THAT BOSTON HAD BEEN FOUNDED THERE AT LAST THAT LANDING IS ACHIEVED
7059-88364-0007 PATRIOTIC ART STUDENTS HAVE DISCUSSED WITH MINGLED IRONY AND ADMIRATION THE BOSTON DOMINATION OF THE ONLY AMERICAN CULTURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NAMELY LITERATURE INDIANAPOLIS HAS HAD HER DAY SINCE THEN
7059-88364-0008 CHICAGO IS LIFTING HER HEAD NEVERTHELESS BOSTON STILL CONTROLS THE TEXT BOOK IN ENGLISH AND DOMINATES OUR HIGH SCHOOLS IRONIC FEELINGS IN THIS MATTER ON THE PART OF WESTERN MEN ARE BASED SOMEWHAT ON ENVY AND ILLEGITIMATE CUSSEDNESS
7059-88364-0009 BUT ARE ALSO GROUNDED IN THE HONEST HOPE OF A HEALTHFUL RIVALRY THEY WANT NEW ROMANTICISTS AND ARTISTS AS INDIGENOUS TO THEIR SOIL AS WAS HAWTHORNE TO WITCH HAUNTED SALEM OR LONGFELLOW TO THE CHESTNUTS OF HIS NATIVE HEATH
7059-88364-0010 WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THE PATRIARCHS FROM OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES TO AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT THEY WERE TRUE SONS OF THE NEW ENGLAND STONE FENCES AND MEETING HOUSES THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN OR NURTURED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
7059-88364-0011 SOME OF US VIEW WITH A PECULIAR THRILL THE PROSPECT THAT LOS ANGELES MAY BECOME THE BOSTON OF THE PHOTOPLAY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY THE FLORENCE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REMINDS ONE
7059-88364-0012 YET THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THE PRESENT DAY MAN IN THE STREET MAN ABOUT TOWN CALIFORNIAN HAS AN OBVIOUS MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIM THAT IS ALLIED TO THE EUCALYPTUS TREE THE POMEGRANATE CALIFORNIA IS A GILDED STATE
7059-88364-0013 IT HAS NOT THE SORDIDNESS OF GOLD AS HAS WALL STREET BUT IT IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE NATURAL ORE THAT THE RAGGED PROSPECTOR FINDS THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA IS THE COLOR OF THE ORANGE THE GLITTER OF DAWN IN THE YOSEMITE
7059-88364-0014 THE HUE OF THE GOLDEN GATE THAT OPENS THE SUNSET WAY TO MYSTIC AND TERRIBLE CATHAY AND HINDUSTAN THE ENEMY OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THE STATE IS MAGNIFICENT BUT THIN
7059-88364-0015 HE DECLARES IT IS AS THOUGH IT WERE PAINTED ON A BROBDINGNAGIAN PIECE OF GILT PAPER AND HE WHO DAMPENS HIS FINGER AND THRUSTS IT THROUGH FINDS AN ALKALI VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE LONELY PRICKLY PEAR AND A HEAP OF ASHES FROM A DESERTED CAMP FIRE
7059-88364-0016 HE SAYS THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE LACK THE RICHNESS OF AN AESTHETIC AND RELIGIOUS TRADITION HE SAYS THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR TIME BUT EVEN THESE THINGS MAKE FOR COINCIDENCE
7059-88364-0017 AS THE SHADOW IT THROWS UPON THE SCREEN THIS NEWNESS CALIFORNIA HAS IN COMMON WITH ALL PHOTOPLAYS IT IS THRILLINGLY POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE AND THE ART TO ACQUIRE SPIRITUAL TRADITION AND DEPTH TOGETHER
7059-88364-0018 PART OF THE THINNESS OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY ITS YOUTH BUT THE RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL FACT THAT THE HUMAN RACE IS THERE SPREAD OVER SO MANY ACRES OF LAND THEY TRY NOT ONLY TO COUNT THEIR MINES AND ENUMERATE THEIR PALM TREES
7059-88364-0019 BUT THEY COUNT THE MILES OF THEIR SEA COAST AND THE ACRES UNDER CULTIVATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAKS AND REVEL IN LARGE STATISTICS AND THE BIGNESS GENERALLY AND FORGET HOW A FEW MEN RATTLE AROUND IN A GREAT DEAL OF SCENERY
7059-88364-0020 THEY SHOUT THEIR STATISTICS ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND THE DESERTS TO NEW YORK THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NON EXISTENT TO THE CALIFORNIAN HIS FELLOW FEELING IS FOR THE OPPOSITE COAST LINE
7059-88364-0021 THROUGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL ACCIDENT OF SEPARATION BY MOUNTAIN AND DESERT FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HE BECOMES A MERE SHOUTER HURRAHING SO ASSIDUOUSLY THAT ALL VARIETY IN THE VOICE IS LOST
7059-88364-0022 THEY WILL BE A DIFFERENT SET OF VIRTUES FROM THOSE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE IS NO MORE NATURAL PLACE FOR THE SCATTERING OF CONFETTI THAN THIS STATE EXCEPT THE MOVING PICTURE SCENE ITSELF BOTH HAVE A GENIUS FOR GARDENS AND DANCING AND CARNIVAL
7059-88364-0023 WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN RELEGATES THE DRAMATIC TO SECONDARY SCENES BOTH IN HIS LIFE AND HIS PHOTOPLAY AND TURNS TO THE GENUINELY EPIC AND LYRIC
7059-88364-0024 HE AND THIS INSTRUMENT MAY FIND THEIR IMMORTALITY TOGETHER AS NEW ENGLAND FOUND ITS SOUL IN THE ESSAYS OF EMERSON
7059-88364-0025 THROUGH ALL FOUR SEASONS FAIRY BEAUTY OVERWHELMS THE LUMBERING GRAND STAND PLAYERS THE TINIEST GARDEN IS A JEWELLED PATHWAY OF WONDER BUT THE CALIFORNIAN CANNOT SHOUT
7059-88364-0026 ORANGE BLOSSOMS ORANGE BLOSSOMS HELIOTROPE HELIOTROPE HE CANNOT BOOM FORTH ROSELEAVES ROSELEAVES SO THAT HE DOES THEIR BEAUTIES JUSTICE
7059-88364-0027 HERE IS WHERE THE PHOTOPLAY CAN BEGIN TO GIVE HIM A MORE DELICATE UTTERANCE AND HE CAN GO ON INTO STRANGER THINGS AND EVOLVE ALL THE SPLENDOR FILMS INTO HIGHER TYPES FOR THE VERY NAME OF CALIFORNIA IS SPLENDOR
7059-88364-0028 THE CALIFORNIA PHOTO PLAYWRIGHT CAN BASE HIS CROWD PICTURE UPON THE CITY WORSHIPPING MOBS OF SAN FRANCISCO HE CAN DERIVE HIS PATRIOTIC AND RELIGIOUS SPLENDORS FROM SOMETHING OLDER AND MORE MAGNIFICENT
7059-88364-0029 THAN THE AISLES OF THE ROMANESQUE NAMELY THE GROVES OF THE GIANT REDWOODS THE CAMPAIGN FOR A BEAUTIFUL NATION COULD VERY WELL EMANATE FROM THE WEST COAST WHERE WITH THE SLIGHTEST CARE
7059-88364-0030 GROW UP MODELS FOR ALL THE WORLD OF PLANT ARRANGEMENT AND TREE LUXURY OUR MECHANICAL EAST IS REPROVED OUR TENSION IS RELAXED OUR UGLINESS IS CHALLENGED EVERY TIME WE LOOK UPON THOSE GARDEN PATHS AND FORESTS
7059-88364-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE FOR LOS ANGELES TO LAY HOLD OF THE MOTION PICTURE AS OUR NATIONAL TEXT BOOK IN ART AS BOSTON APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE NATIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF LITERATURE
7059-88364-0032 IF CALIFORNIA HAS A SHINING SOUL AND NOT MERELY A GOLDEN BODY LET HER FORGET HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MELODRAMATICS AND TURN TO HER POETS WHO UNDERSTAND THE HEART UNDERNEATH THE GLORY EDWIN MARKHAM
7059-88364-0033 THE DEAN OF AMERICAN SINGERS CLARK ASHTON SMITH THE YOUNG STAR TREADER GEORGE STERLING THAT SON OF ANCIENT MERLIN HAVE IN THEIR SONGS THE SEEDS OF BETTER SCENARIOS THAN CALIFORNIA HAS SENT US
7059-88364-0034 THERE ARE TWO POEMS BY GEORGE STERLING THAT I HAVE HAD IN MIND FOR MANY A DAY AS CONCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD INSPIRE MYSTIC FILMS AKIN TO THEM THESE POEMS ARE THE NIGHT SENTRIES AND
7059-77900-0000 MISS NORTHWICK CALLED UPON ANNIE DURING THE WEEK WITH EXCUSES FOR HER DELAY AND FOR COMING ALONE SHE SEEMED TO HAVE INTENTIONS OF BEING POLITE BUT SHE CONSTANTLY BETRAYED HER WANT OF INTEREST IN ANNIE AND DISAPPOINTED AN EXPECTATION OF REFINEMENT
7059-77900-0001 WHICH HER PHYSICAL DELICACY AWAKENED SHE ASKED HER HOW SHE EVER CAME TO TAKE UP THE SOCIAL UNION AND ANSWERED FOR HER THAT OF COURSE IT HAD THE ATTRACTION OF THE THEATRICALS AND WENT ON TO TALK OF HER SISTER'S PART IN THEM
7059-77900-0002 THE RELATION OF THE NORTHWICK FAMILY TO THE COMING ENTERTAINMENT AND AN IMPRESSION OF FRAIL MOTTLED WRISTS AND HIGH THIN CHEEKS AND AN ABSENCE OF MODELLING UNDER AFFLUENT DRAPERY WAS THE MAIN EFFECT OF MISS NORTHWICK'S VISIT WHEN ANNIE RETURNED IT
7059-77900-0003 SHE MET THE YOUNGER SISTER WHOM SHE FOUND A GREAT BEAUTY SHE SEEMED VERY COLD AND OF A HAUTEUR WHICH SHE SUBDUED WITH DIFFICULTY BUT SHE WAS MORE CONSECUTIVELY POLITE THAN HER SISTER AND ANNIE WATCHED WITH FASCINATION HER TURNS OF THE HEAD
7059-77900-0004 HER MOVEMENTS OF LEOPARD SWIFTNESS AND ELASTICITY THE CHANGING LIGHTS OF HER COMPLEXION THE CURVES OF HER FINE LIPS THE FLUTTERING OF HER THIN NOSTRILS A VERY NEW BASKET PHAETON STOOD GLITTERING AT ANNIE'S DOOR WHEN SHE GOT HOME
7059-77900-0005 AND MISSUS WILMINGTON PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE OPEN PARLOUR WINDOW HOW D'YE DO ANNIE SHE DRAWLED IN HER TENDER VOICE WON'T YOU COME IN YOU SEE I'M IN POSSESSION

7059-77900-0014 THEY CAME ROUND INTO THE REGION OF THE SHOPS AND LYRA CHECKED HER PONY IN FRONT OF HER HUSBAND'S FACTORY IT WAS NOT IMPOSINGLY LARGE BUT AS MISSUS WILMINGTON CAUSED ANNIE TO OBSERVE IT WAS AS BIG AS THE HAT SHOPS AND AS UGLY AS THE SHOE SHOPS
7059-77900-0015 THE STRUCTURE TREMBLED WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND AS THEY MOUNTED THE WOODEN STEPS TO THE OPEN OUTSIDE DOOR AN INNER DOOR SWUNG AJAR FOR A MOMENT AND LET OUT A ROAR MINGLED OF THE HUM AND WHIRL
7059-77900-0016 AND FINDING ITS FIRST APARTMENT EMPTY
7059-77900-0017 WHERE HER HUSBAND SAT WRITING AT A TABLE GEORGE I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS KILBURN
7059-77900-0018 WITH THE HABIT HE HAD OF TOUCHING IT THERE WITH THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE MADE ANNIE THINK OF A CAT THAT HAD BEEN AT THE CREAM I'VE BEEN HOPING TO CALL WITH MISSUS WILMINGTON TO PAY MY RESPECTS BUT I'VE BEEN AWAY A GREAT DEAL THIS SEASON AND AND
7059-77900-0019 WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HOME AGAIN MISS KILBURN I'VE OFTEN HEARD MY WIFE SPEAK OF YOUR OLD DAYS TOGETHER AT HATBORO THEY FENCED WITH SOME POLITE FEINTS OF INTEREST IN EACH OTHER THE OLD MAN STANDING BESIDE HIS WRITING TABLE
7059-77900-0020 AND STAYING HIMSELF WITH A SHAKING HAND UPON IT LYRA INTERRUPTED THEM WELL I THINK NOW THAT ANNIE IS HERE WE'D BETTER NOT LET HER GET AWAY WITHOUT SHOWING HER THE WORKS OH OH DECIDEDLY
7059-77900-0021 I'LL GO WITH YOU WITH GREAT PLEASURE AH HE BUSTLED ABOUT PUTTING THE THINGS TOGETHER ON HIS TABLE AND THEN REACHING FOR THE PANAMA HAT ON A HOOK BEHIND IT THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO DO WHAT LYRA BADE HIM
7059-77900-0022 I'LL SHOW THEM THROUGH HE SAID TO HIS UNCLE AND THE OLD MAN ASSENTED WITH WELL PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER JACK AND WENT BACK TO HIS ROOM THE WILMINGTON STOCKING MILLS SPUN THEIR OWN THREADS
7059-77900-0023 AND THE FIRST ROOM WAS LIKE WHAT ANNIE HAD SEEN BEFORE IN COTTON FACTORIES WITH A FAINT SMELL OF OIL FROM THE MACHINERY AND A FINE SNOW OF FLUFF IN THE AIR AND CATCHING TO THE WHITE WASHED WALLS AND THE FOUL WINDOW SASHES
7059-77900-0024 THE TIRELESS MACHINES MARCHED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE MEN WHO WATCHED THEM WITH SUICIDAL INTENSITY RAN AFTER THEM BAREFOOTED WHEN THEY MADE OFF WITH A BROKEN THREAD SPLICED IT AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THEM TO THEIR STATIONS AGAIN
7059-77900-0025 THEY LOOKED AFTER LYRA AND HER NEPHEW FROM UNDER COTTON FROWSED BANGS THEY ALL SEEMED TO KNOW HER AND RETURNED HER EASY KINDLY GREETINGS WITH AN EFFECT OF LIKING
7059-77900-0026 FROM TIME TO TIME AT LYRA'S BIDDING THE YOUNG FELLOW EXPLAINED TO ANNIE SOME CURIOUS FEATURE OF THE PROCESSES
7059-77900-0027 EXCEPT WHEN JACK WILMINGTON CURTLY ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS OR THAT IN ILLUSTRATION OF SOME POINT HE WAS EXPLAINING SHE WEARIED HERSELF AS PEOPLE DO IN SUCH PLACES IN EXPRESSING HER WONDER AT THE INGENUITY OF THE MACHINERY
7059-77900-0028 IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL INTO THE ROOM COOL AND QUIET WHERE HALF A DOZEN NEAT GIRLS WERE COUNTING AND STAMPING THE STOCKINGS WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS HERE'S WHERE I USED TO WORK SAID LYRA
7059-77900-0029 AND HERE'S WHERE I FIRST MET MISTER WILMINGTON THE PLACE IS FULL OF ROMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS THE STOCKINGS ARE ALL ONE SIZE ANNIE
7059-77900-0030 I DON'T WELL THEY'RE NOT DREAMS EXACTLY ANNIE WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE FOR THEM WHEN THEY LEFT THE MILL SHE ASKED ANNIE TO COME HOME TO TEA WITH HER SAYING
7059-77900-0031 AS IF FROM A PERCEPTION OF HER DISLIKE FOR THE YOUNG FELLOW THAT JACK WAS GOING TO BOSTON THEY HAD A LONG EVENING TOGETHER AFTER MISTER WILMINGTON TOOK HIMSELF OFF AFTER TEA TO HIS STUDY AS HE CALLED IT
7059-77900-0032 AND REMAINED SHUT IN THERE ANNIE WAS UNEASILY AWARE OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT LYRA HAD APPARENTLY NO MORE DISTURBANCE FROM HIS ABSENCE THAN FROM HIS PRESENCE WHICH SHE HAD MANAGED WITH A FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF EVERYTHING IT SUGGESTED
7059-77900-0033 SHE TALKED FREELY OF HER MARRIAGE NOT AS IF IT WERE LIKE OTHERS BUT FOR WHAT IT WAS SHE SHOWED ANNIE OVER THE HOUSE AND SHE ENDED WITH A DISPLAY OF THE RICH DRESSES WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS BUYING HER AND WHICH SHE NEVER WORE BECAUSE SHE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE
7059-77900-0034 ANNIE SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO GO TO THE SEASIDE SOMEWHERE DURING THE SUMMER BUT NO LYRA SAID IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE AND YOU KNOW ANNIE I ALWAYS DID HATE TROUBLE
7059-77900-0035 AND I DON'T WANT TO BE POKED INTO A HOTEL SO I STAY IN HATBORO SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A VILLAGE GIRL AND DID NOT MISS THE INTERESTS OF A LARGER LIFE AS SHE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THEM IN SOUTH HATBORO OR WANT THE BOTHER OF THEM
7059-77900-0036 SHE SAID SHE STUDIED MUSIC A LITTLE AND CONFESSED THAT SHE READ A GOOD DEAL NOVELS MOSTLY THOUGH THE LIBRARY WAS HANDSOMELY EQUIPPED WITH WELL BOUND GENERAL LITERATURE AT MOMENTS IT ALL SEEMED NO HARM
7059-77900-0037 AT OTHERS THE LUXURY IN WHICH THIS LIFE WAS SO CONTENTEDLY SUNK OPPRESSED ANNIE LIKE A THICK CLOSE AIR YET SHE KNEW THAT LYRA WAS KIND TO MANY OF THE POOR PEOPLE ABOUT HER AND DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AS THE PHRASE IS
7059-77900-0038 WITH THE SUPERFLUITY WHICH IT INVOLVED NO SELF DENIAL TO GIVE FROM BUT MISTER PECK HAD GIVEN HER A POINT OF VIEW AND THOUGH SHE BELIEVED SHE DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM IT
7059-77900-0039 OUGHT TO BE TACIT OR EXPLICIT IN THE KISSING AND EMBRACING BETWEEN ROMEO AND JULIET
7059-77900-0040 OH THEN SAID ANNIE PERHAPS HE ACCOUNTS FOR HER PLAYING JULIET
7059-77900-0041 OH IT'S AT THE REHEARSALS YOU KNOW THAT THE FUN IS
7059-77900-0042 ANNIE LAY AWAKE A LONG TIME THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SURE THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO LIKE LYRA IF SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF HER AND THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE GONE HOME TO TEA WITH HER AND SPENT THE EVENING WITH HER UNLESS SHE FULLY RESPECTED HER
6209-34601-0000 MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A STRANGE AND ALARMING GRINDING OF TEETH REACHED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE BACK HE ADVANCED
6209-34601-0001 TO THOSE TO WHOM SILENCE HAS BECOME DREADFUL A HOWL IS COMFORTING THAT FIERCE GROWL REASSURED HIM THAT THREAT WAS A PROMISE THERE WAS THERE A BEING ALIVE AND AWAKE
6209-34601-0002 MADE BY THE REFLECTION OF SNOW AND SEA HE SAW A THING PLACED AS IF FOR SHELTER IT WAS A CART UNLESS IT WAS A HOVEL IT HAD WHEELS IT WAS A CARRIAGE IT HAD A ROOF IT WAS A DWELLING
6209-34601-0003 FROM THE ROOF AROSE A FUNNEL AND OUT OF THE FUNNEL SMOKE THIS SMOKE WAS RED AND SEEMED TO IMPLY A GOOD FIRE IN THE INTERIOR BEHIND PROJECTING HINGES INDICATED A DOOR
6209-34601-0004 AND IN THE CENTRE OF THIS DOOR A SQUARE OPENING SHOWED A LIGHT INSIDE THE CARAVAN HE APPROACHED
6209-34601-0005 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MOUTH BETWEEN THE WHEELS A HEAD WAS PUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6209-34601-0006 THE MOUTH WAS SILENT THE HEAD BEGAN AGAIN IS ANY ONE THERE THE CHILD ANSWERED YES WHO I YOU WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME
6209-34601-0007 I AM WEARY SAID THE CHILD WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT I AM COLD WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE I AM HUNGRY THE HEAD REPLIED
6209-34601-0008 THE CHILD BOWED HIS FOREHEAD DREW THE SLEEPING INFANT CLOSER IN HIS ARMS AND COLLECTED HIS STRENGTH TO RESUME HIS JOURNEY HE HAD TAKEN A FEW STEPS AND WAS HURRYING AWAY
6209-34601-0009 THE CHILD TURNED BACK
6209-34601-0010 RESUMED THE VOICE WHO HAS SENT ME A FELLOW LIKE THIS WHO IS HUNGRY AND COLD AND WHO DOES NOT COME IN THE CHILD AT ONCE REPULSED AND INVITED REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE VOICE CONTINUED
6209-34601-0011 YOU ARE TOLD TO COME IN YOU YOUNG RASCAL HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND PLACED ONE FOOT ON THE LOWEST STEP THERE WAS A GREAT GROWL UNDER THE VAN HE DREW BACK THE GAPING JAWS APPEARED
6209-34601-0012 CRIED THE VOICE OF THE MAN THE JAWS RETREATED THE GROWLING CEASED COME UP CONTINUED THE MAN THE CHILD WITH DIFFICULTY CLIMBED UP THE THREE STEPS HE WAS IMPEDED BY THE INFANT
6209-34601-0013 SO BENUMBED ROLLED UP AND ENVELOPED IN THE JACKET THAT NOTHING COULD BE DISTINGUISHED OF HER AND SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE SHAPELESS MASS HE PASSED OVER THE THREE STEPS AND HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD STOPPED
6209-34601-0014 NO CANDLE WAS BURNING IN THE CARAVAN PROBABLY FROM THE ECONOMY OF WANT THE HUT WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A RED TINGE ARISING FROM THE OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE STOVE IN WHICH SPARKLED A PEAT FIRE
6209-34601-0015 ON THE STOVE WERE SMOKING A PORRINGER AND A SAUCEPAN CONTAINING TO ALL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TO EAT THE SAVOURY ODOUR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE HUT WAS FURNISHED WITH A CHEST
6209-34601-0016 BESIDES TO THE PARTITION WERE ATTACHED SOME BOARDS ON BRACKETS AND SOME HOOKS FROM WHICH HUNG A VARIETY OF THINGS ON THE BOARDS AND NAILS WERE ROWS OF GLASSES COPPERS AN ALEMBIC
6209-34601-0017 A VESSEL RATHER LIKE THOSE USED FOR GRAINING WAX WHICH ARE CALLED GRANULATORS AND A CONFUSION OF STRANGE OBJECTS OF WHICH THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND WHICH WERE UTENSILS FOR COOKING AND CHEMISTRY THE CARAVAN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
6209-34601-0018 THE STOVE BEING IN FRONT IT WAS NOT EVEN A LITTLE ROOM IT WAS SCARCELY A BIG BOX THERE WAS MORE LIGHT OUTSIDE FROM THE SNOW THAN INSIDE FROM THE STOVE EVERYTHING IN THE CARAVAN WAS INDISTINCT AND MISTY
6209-34601-0019 NEVERTHELESS A REFLECTION OF THE FIRE ON THE CEILING ENABLED THE SPECTATOR TO READ IN LARGE LETTERS URSUS PHILOSOPHER THE CHILD IN FACT WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE OF HOMO AND URSUS
6209-34601-0020 THE ONE HE HAD JUST HEARD GROWLING THE OTHER SPEAKING THE CHILD HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD PERCEIVED NEAR THE STOVE A MAN TALL SMOOTH THIN AND OLD DRESSED IN GRAY WHOSE HEAD AS HE STOOD
6209-34601-0021 REACHED THE ROOF THE MAN COULD NOT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE THE CARAVAN WAS JUST HIS SIZE COME IN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS URSUS THE CHILD ENTERED PUT DOWN YOUR BUNDLE
6209-34601-0022 IS IT THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF TEARING A HOLE IN YOUR RAGS WORTHLESS VAGABOND IN THE STREETS AT THIS HOUR WHO ARE YOU ANSWER BUT NO I FORBID YOU TO ANSWER THERE YOU ARE COLD
6209-34601-0023 AND WITH FEVERISH HASTE HE DRAGGED OFF THE BOY'S RAGS WHICH TORE INTO SHREDS WITH THE OTHER HE TOOK DOWN FROM A NAIL A MAN'S SHIRT AND ONE OF THOSE KNITTED JACKETS WHICH ARE UP TO THIS DAY CALLED KISS ME QUICKS HERE ARE CLOTHES
6209-34601-0024 AND CHAFED BEFORE THE FIRE THE LIMBS OF THE EXHAUSTED AND BEWILDERED CHILD WHO AT THAT MOMENT WARM AND NAKED FELT AS IF HE WERE SEEING AND TOUCHING HEAVEN THE LIMBS HAVING BEEN RUBBED HE NEXT WIPED THE BOY'S FEET
6209-34601-0025 AND THE MAN SLIPPED THE KNITTED JACKET OVER IT NOW THE MAN KICKED THE STOOL FORWARD AND MADE THE LITTLE BOY SIT DOWN AGAIN SHOVING HIM BY THE SHOULDERS THEN HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO THE PORRINGER WHICH WAS SMOKING UPON THE STOVE
6209-34601-0026 WHAT THE CHILD SAW IN THE PORRINGER WAS AGAIN HEAVEN TO HIM NAMELY A POTATO AND A BIT OF BACON YOU ARE HUNGRY
6209-34601-0027 THE MAN TOOK FROM THE SHELF A CRUST OF HARD BREAD AND AN IRON FORK AND HANDED THEM TO THE CHILD THE BOY HESITATED PERHAPS YOU EXPECT ME TO LAY THE CLOTH SAID THE MAN AND HE PLACED THE PORRINGER ON THE CHILD'S LAP
6209-34601-0028 NOT SO QUICK YOU HORRID GLUTTON ISN'T HE A GREEDY SCOUNDREL
6209-34601-0029 YOU SHOULD SEE A LORD SUP IN MY TIME I HAVE SEEN DUKES EAT THEY DON'T EAT THAT'S NOBLE THEY DRINK HOWEVER COME YOU PIG STUFF YOURSELF THE ABSENCE OF EARS
6209-34601-0030 FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS ABSORBED BY TWO EXIGENCIES AND BY TWO ECSTASIES FOOD AND WARMTH URSUS CONTINUED HIS IMPRECATIONS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
6209-34601-0031 I HAVE SEEN KING JAMES SUPPING IN PROPRIA PERSONA IN THE BANQUETING HOUSE WHERE ARE TO BE ADMIRED THE PAINTINGS OF THE FAMOUS RUBENS HIS MAJESTY TOUCHED NOTHING THIS BEGGAR HERE BROWSES
6209-34601-0032 BROWSES A WORD DERIVED FROM BRUTE WHAT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO COME TO THIS WEYMOUTH SEVEN TIMES DEVOTED TO THE INFERNAL DEITIES I HAVE SOLD NOTHING SINCE MORNING I HAVE HARANGUED THE SNOW
6209-34601-0033 I HAVE PLAYED THE FLUTE TO THE HURRICANE I HAVE NOT POCKETED A FARTHING AND NOW TO NIGHT BEGGARS DROP IN HORRID PLACE THERE IS
6209-34601-0034 BATTLE STRUGGLE COMPETITION BETWEEN THE FOOLS IN THE STREET AND MYSELF THEY TRY TO GIVE ME NOTHING BUT FARTHINGS I TRY TO GIVE THEM NOTHING BUT DRUGS WELL TO DAY I'VE MADE NOTHING
6209-34601-0035 NOT AN IDIOT ON THE HIGHWAY NOT A PENNY IN THE TILL EAT AWAY HELL BORN BOY TEAR AND CRUNCH WE HAVE FALLEN ON TIMES WHEN NOTHING CAN EQUAL THE CYNICISM OF SPONGERS FATTEN AT MY EXPENSE PARASITE
6209-34601-0036 THIS WRETCHED BOY IS MORE THAN HUNGRY HE IS MAD IT IS NOT APPETITE IT IS FEROCITY HE IS CARRIED AWAY BY A RABID VIRUS PERHAPS HE HAS THE PLAGUE HAVE YOU THE PLAGUE YOU THIEF
6209-34601-0037 SUPPOSE HE WERE TO GIVE IT TO HOMO NO NEVER LET THE POPULACE DIE BUT NOT MY WOLF BUT BY THE BYE I AM HUNGRY MYSELF I DECLARE THAT THIS IS ALL VERY DISAGREEABLE
6209-34601-0038 ONE CRUST OF BREAD A MOUTHFUL OF BACON AND A DROP OF MILK AND I PUT IT TO WARM
6209-34600-0000 ANOTHER FORM OF DESERT IT WAS WEYMOUTH WHICH HE HAD JUST ENTERED WEYMOUTH THEN WAS NOT THE RESPECTABLE AND FINE WEYMOUTH OF TO DAY ANCIENT WEYMOUTH DID NOT PRESENT LIKE THE PRESENT ONE
6209-34600-0001 FOR THE SAME REASON THEY HAD NOT YET DESIGNED ON THE SLOPE OF THE GREEN HILL TOWARDS THE EAST FASHIONED FLAT ON THE SOIL BY CUTTING AWAY THE TURF AND LEAVING THE BARE CHALK TO THE VIEW THE WHITE HORSE AN ACRE LONG
6209-34600-0002 GEORGE THE THIRD HAVING LOST IN HIS OLD AGE THE INTELLECT HE HAD NEVER POSSESSED IN HIS YOUTH WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CALAMITIES OF HIS REIGN HE WAS AN INNOCENT WHY NOT ERECT STATUES TO HIM
6209-34600-0003 EVEN GOOD WOMEN IN THEIR HOUSES A PELL MELL OF SHEDS THROWN FROM HER DEVIL'S BAG WOULD GIVE AN IDEA OF THAT IRREGULAR WEYMOUTH THE GOOD WOMEN IN THE SHEDS INCLUDED THE MUSIC HALL REMAINS AS A SPECIMEN OF THOSE BUILDINGS
6209-34600-0004 A CONFUSION OF WOODEN DENS CARVED AND EATEN BY WORMS WHICH CARVE IN ANOTHER FASHION SHAPELESS OVERHANGING BUILDINGS SOME WITH PILLARS LEANING ONE AGAINST THE OTHER FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE SEA WIND
6209-34600-0005 AND LEAVING BETWEEN THEM AWKWARD SPACES OF NARROW AND WINDING CHANNELS LANES AND PASSAGES OFTEN FLOODED
6209-34600-0006 THE DESERTED CHILD CARRYING THE FOUNDLING PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET THEN THE SECOND THEN THE THIRD
6209-34600-0007 BUT ALL WERE CLOSED AND DARK AT INTERVALS HE KNOCKED AT THE DOORS NO ONE ANSWERED NOTHING MAKES THE HEART SO LIKE A STONE AS BEING WARM BETWEEN SHEETS THE NOISE AND THE SHAKING HAD AT LENGTH AWAKENED THE INFANT
6209-34600-0008 HE KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE FELT HER SUCK HIS CHEEK SHE DID NOT CRY BELIEVING HIM HER MOTHER HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND WANDER LONG PERHAPS IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SCRAMBRIDGE LANES
6209-34600-0009 THEN MORE CULTIVATED PLOTS THAN DWELLINGS MORE THORN HEDGES THAN HOUSES BUT FORTUNATELY HE STRUCK INTO A PASSAGE WHICH EXISTS TO THIS DAY NEAR TRINITY SCHOOLS THIS PASSAGE LED HIM TO A WATER BRINK
6209-34600-0010 WITH MELCOMBE REGIS AND UNDER THE ARCHES OF WHICH THE BACKWATER JOINS THE HARBOUR WEYMOUTH A HAMLET WAS THEN THE SUBURB OF MELCOMBE REGIS A CITY AND PORT NOW MELCOMBE REGIS IS A PARISH OF WEYMOUTH
6209-34600-0011 THE VILLAGE HAS ABSORBED THE CITY IT WAS THE BRIDGE WHICH DID THE WORK BRIDGES ARE STRANGE VEHICLES OF SUCTION WHICH INHALE THE POPULATION AND SOMETIMES SWELL ONE RIVER BANK AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR
6209-34600-0012 THE BOY WENT TO THE BRIDGE WHICH AT THAT PERIOD WAS A COVERED TIMBER STRUCTURE HE CROSSED IT
6209-34600-0013 THE BRIDGE OPENED ON A RATHER FINE STREET CALLED SAINT THOMAS'S STREET HE ENTERED IT HERE AND THERE WERE HIGH CARVED GABLES AND SHOP FRONTS HE SET TO KNOCKING AT THE DOORS AGAIN
6209-34600-0014 HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT TO CALL OR SHOUT AT MELCOMBE REGIS AS AT WEYMOUTH NO ONE WAS STIRRING THE DOORS WERE ALL CAREFULLY DOUBLE LOCKED THE WINDOWS WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHUTTERS AS THE EYES BY THEIR LIDS
6209-34600-0015 ALL ITS LETHARGIES MINGLE THEIR NIGHTMARES ITS SLUMBERS ARE A CROWD AND FROM ITS HUMAN BODIES LYING PRONE THERE ARISES A VAPOUR OF DREAMS SLEEP HAS GLOOMY ASSOCIATES BEYOND THIS LIFE
6209-34600-0016 THE DECOMPOSED THOUGHTS OF THE SLEEPERS FLOAT ABOVE THEM IN A MIST WHICH IS BOTH OF DEATH AND OF LIFE AND COMBINE WITH THE POSSIBLE WHICH HAS ALSO PERHAPS THE POWER OF THOUGHT AS IT FLOATS IN SPACE
6209-34600-0017 HENCE ARISE ENTANGLEMENTS DREAMS THOSE CLOUDS INTERPOSE THEIR FOLDS AND THEIR TRANSPARENCIES OVER THAT STAR THE MIND
6209-34600-0018 INTO IMPALPABILITY MYSTERIOUS DIFFUSED EXISTENCES AMALGAMATE THEMSELVES WITH LIFE ON THAT BORDER OF DEATH WHICH SLEEP IS THOSE LARVAE AND SOULS MINGLE IN THE AIR
6209-34600-0019 EVEN HE WHO SLEEPS NOT FEELS A MEDIUM PRESS UPON HIM FULL OF SINISTER LIFE THE SURROUNDING CHIMERA IN WHICH HE SUSPECTS A REALITY IMPEDES HIM THE WAKING MAN
6209-34600-0020 WENDING HIS WAY AMIDST THE SLEEP PHANTOMS OF OTHERS UNCONSCIOUSLY PUSHES BACK PASSING SHADOWS HAS OR IMAGINES THAT HE HAS A VAGUE FEAR OF ADVERSE CONTACT WITH THE INVISIBLE
6209-34600-0021 AND FEELS AT EVERY MOMENT THE OBSCURE PRESSURE OF A HOSTILE ENCOUNTER WHICH IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE EFFECT OF A FOREST IN THE NOCTURNAL DIFFUSION OF DREAMS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED BEING AFRAID WITHOUT REASON
6209-34600-0022 WHAT A MAN FEELS A CHILD FEELS STILL MORE THE UNEASINESS OF NOCTURNAL FEAR INCREASED BY THE SPECTRAL HOUSES INCREASED THE WEIGHT OF THE SAD BURDEN UNDER WHICH HE WAS STRUGGLING
6209-34600-0023 WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE OCEAN HE NO LONGER KNEW IN WHAT DIRECTION THE SEA LAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS STRUCK TO THE LEFT BY MAIDEN STREET AND RETURNED AS FAR AS SAINT ALBAN'S ROW
6209-34600-0024 THERE BY CHANCE AND WITHOUT SELECTION HE KNOCKED VIOLENTLY AT ANY HOUSE THAT HE HAPPENED TO PASS HIS BLOWS ON WHICH HE WAS EXPENDING HIS LAST ENERGIES WERE JERKY AND WITHOUT AIM NOW CEASING ALTOGETHER FOR A TIME
6209-34600-0025 ONE VOICE ANSWERED THAT OF TIME THREE O'CLOCK TOLLED SLOWLY BEHIND HIM FROM THE OLD BELFRY OF SAINT NICHOLAS THEN ALL SANK INTO SILENCE AGAIN
6209-34600-0026 THEY WERE JUST OVER A SOMEWHAT SEVERE OUTBREAK OF THE PLAGUE IN LONDON AND THAT THE FEAR OF RECEIVING SICK VAGABONDS CAUSED A DIMINUTION OF HOSPITALITY EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WOULD NOT EVEN OPEN THEIR WINDOWS FOR FEAR OF INHALING THE POISON
6209-34600-0027 THE CHILD FELT THE COLDNESS OF MEN MORE TERRIBLY THAN THE COLDNESS OF NIGHT
6209-34600-0028 THE PITILESS DESERT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD THE UNRELENTING TOWN WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR THE HOUR THE STROKES OF WHICH HE HAD JUST COUNTED HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLOW
6209-34600-0029 NOTHING IS SO FREEZING IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AS THE VOICE OF THE HOUR IT IS A DECLARATION OF INDIFFERENCE IT IS ETERNITY SAYING WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME HE STOPPED
6209-34600-0030 TO LIE DOWN THERE AND DIE HOWEVER THE LITTLE INFANT LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN THIS BLIND CONFIDENCE SET HIM ONWARDS AGAIN
6209-34600-0031 HE WHOM ALL SUPPORTS WERE FAILING FELT THAT HE WAS HIMSELF A BASIS OF SUPPORT IRRESISTIBLE SUMMONS OF DUTY NEITHER SUCH IDEAS NOR SUCH A SITUATION BELONGED TO HIS AGE
6209-34600-0032 HE DID WHAT HE CHANCED TO DO HE SET OUT AGAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF JOHNSTONE ROW BUT NOW HE NO LONGER WALKED HE DRAGGED HIMSELF ALONG HE LEFT SAINT MARY'S STREET TO THE LEFT MADE ZIGZAGS THROUGH LANES
6209-34600-0033 HE PERCEIVED THE SEA TO THE RIGHT AND SCARCELY ANYTHING MORE OF THE TOWN TO HIS LEFT WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM HERE WAS THE COUNTRY AGAIN TO THE EAST GREAT INCLINED PLANES OF SNOW MARKED OUT THE WIDE SLOPES OF RADIPOLE
6209-34600-0034 SHOULD HE CONTINUE THIS JOURNEY SHOULD HE ADVANCE AND RE ENTER THE SOLITUDES SHOULD HE RETURN AND RE ENTER THE STREETS WHAT WAS HE TO DO BETWEEN THOSE TWO SILENCES THE MUTE PLAIN AND THE DEAF CITY
6209-34600-0035 WHICH OF THE TWO REFUSALS SHOULD HE CHOOSE THERE IS THE ANCHOR OF MERCY THERE IS ALSO THE LOOK OF PITEOUSNESS IT WAS THAT LOOK WHICH THE POOR LITTLE DESPAIRING WANDERER THREW AROUND HIM
8747-293952-0000 THINGS WENT VERY SMOOTHLY AT GORE HALL AFTER DURHAM HAD ESTABLISHED LUCY AS ITS MISTRESS DURING THE ABSENCE OF BERNARD THE GIRL HERSELF FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HER COUSIN WAS DEAD AND ASSUMED DEEP MOURNING
8747-293952-0001 AND FELT HIS LOSS DEEPLY IT WAS HER OUTSPOKEN AFFECTION THAT PROVOKED A QUARREL BETWEEN HER AND JULIUS AND WHICH LED TO THE BREAKING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT LUCY HAD A HIGH TEMPER WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT IN SUBJECTION DURING THE LIFE OF SIR SIMON
8747-293952-0002 BUT NOW THAT SHE TASTED THE SWEETS OF POWER SHE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO ALLOW JULIUS TO TREAT HER AS HE CHOSE MISSUS GILROY CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT TO THE LAWYER
8747-293952-0003 SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND HAD GIVEN DURHAM AN INKLING AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MICHAEL HAVING MASQUERADED AS BERNARD
8747-293952-0004 KNOWING THAT SHE HAD MARRIED WALTER GORE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH SHE BUILT HER CLAIM YET SHE TRUSTED TO HER OWN CLEVERNESS TO CONCEAL THIS FROM THE TOO CLEVER LAWYER BUT APART FROM THIS
8747-293952-0005 THE FACT THAT HE SUSPECTED SOMEONE OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS BERNARD STARTLED HER AND OPENED AN ABYSS AT HER FEET ON LEAVING THE OFFICE SHE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOWER HER CREST FOR THE MOMENT AND TO WAIT PATIENTLY TO SEE WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE
8747-293952-0006 MISSUS GILROY WAS A WELL EDUCATED WOMAN AND VERY ASTUTE THEREFORE SHE HOPED TO GAIN HER ENDS BY CRAFT IF NOT BY FORCE SO FAR SHE HAD FAILED BUT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO ABANDON HER CLAIM
8747-293952-0007 FOR ONE FAILURE AS IT WAS SHE CAME BACK TO THE HALL AND BEHAVED HERSELF MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE SHE WAS RESPECTFUL TO LUCY AND DID NOT DISPLAY HER IMPATIENCE OF COMMANDS THAT
8747-293952-0008 SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN MEEKER AND ALTHOUGH MISS RANDOLPH DID NOT LIKE OR TRUST THE WOMAN SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HER IN ANY WAY LUCY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE SHOCK OF SIR SIMON'S TRAGIC DEATH
8747-293952-0009 AND FROM THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF SIR BERNARD IN FACT THE MATTER SO PREYED ON HER NERVES THAT SHE BECAME PROSTRATE AND DOCTOR PAYNE HAD TO BE CALLED IN HE WAS A HANDSOME AND POPULAR YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAD PRACTICED IN HURSETON
8747-293952-0010 HE WAS NATURALLY VERY PLEASED AND WAS VERY ATTENTIVE A COMPLETE REST IS WHAT YOU NEED HE SAID TO MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0011 AND I WILL GIVE YOU A TONIC NATURALLY YOU SUFFER FROM THE TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIR SIMON'S DEATH HE THOUGHT A MOMENT
8747-293952-0012 A CHEERFUL COMPANION WOULD DO YOU GOOD SHALL I ASK MISS MALLESON TO COME OVER IS SHE CHEERFUL ASKED LUCY LANGUIDLY I FEAR NOT DOCTOR SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MY COUSIN AND HIS DEATH HAS MADE HER SAD
8747-293952-0013 PROBABLY BUT SHE BEARS UP WONDERFULLY BUT THAT SHE IS IN MOURNING ONE WOULD HARDLY GUESS SHE HAD SUSTAINED SUCH A LOSS WAS SHE VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MISTER GORE YES
8747-293952-0014 I NEVER SAW A MORE ATTACHED COUPLE DID YOU EVER MEET HIM ONCE AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S YOU KNOW I AM GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE OLD LADY I OFTEN VISIT HER NOT PROFESSIONALLY FOR SHE IS AS HEALTHY AS A TROUT IN A POND
8747-293952-0015 IS ALICE MISS MALLESON ALSO WELL IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND APPEARS RESIGNED TO HER LOSS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT MORE SAID LUCY PERPLEXED
8747-293952-0016 ALICE HAS SUCH A TENDER HEART DOCTOR PAYNE WAS DOUBTFUL SO FAR AS HE SAW MISS MALLESON WAS REMARKABLY CHEERFUL UNDER HER SORROW SHE IS PHILOSOPHIC MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0017 I THINK HOWEVER IF YOU WOULD HAVE HER OVER TO SEE YOU IT WOULD DO BOTH HER AND YOURSELF GOOD I SHALL WRITE A NOTE TO HER TO DAY SAID LUCY I AM VERY FOND OF HER AND WE GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER
8747-293952-0018 POOR ALICE I WISH BERNARD HAD LIVED
8747-293952-0019 RISING TO TAKE HIS LEAVE IF HE WAS GUILTY AH SAID LUCY RAISING HERSELF WITH ANIMATION FROM THE SOFA UPON WHICH SHE WAS LYING IF HE WAS GUILTY
8747-293952-0020 I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WAS
8747-293952-0021 BUT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS CONTROL IT AND WAS A KIND HEARTED BOY HE IS INNOCENT I AM SURE HOW ARE YOU SURE MY DEAR LUCY ASKED A THIRD VOICE AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE JULIUS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
8747-293952-0022 HE CAME FORWARD FORGIVE ME IF I HEARD A FEW WORDS OF YOUR CONVERSATION BUT I HAVE JUST COME IN DOCTOR PAYNE I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL QUITE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR WHO DID NOT LIKE BERYL THINKING HIM

8747-293952-0025 REST AND CHEERFUL COMPANY MISS MALLESON'S FOR CHOICE HE DEPARTED SMILING AND THEY HEARD HIM GALLOP OFF WHEN THE SOUND OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS DIED AWAY
8747-293952-0026 WHY DO YOU THINK BERNARD IS INNOCENT HE ASKED BECAUSE IF HE IS GUILTY HIS ACTION GIVES THE LIE TO HIS WHOLE LIFE JULIUS SHE REPLIED RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KILLED MY UNCLE
8747-293952-0027 SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
8747-293952-0028 IF WE EVER DO MARRY SAID JULIUS GLOOMILY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT JULIUS WE WERE NEVER SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER BERYL'S VANITY WAS HURT
8747-293952-0029 WHY DID YOU ACCEPT ME THEN WHAT ELSE COULD I DO IT WAS SIR SIMON'S WISH THAT WE SHOULD MARRY AND OWING TO MY CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER DURING HIS LIFE I WAS MERELY A PUPPET
8747-293952-0030 ALTHOUGH YOU SWORE FOR AN HOUR
8747-293952-0031 YOU TOLD SIR SIMON ABOUT BERNARD BEING IN LOVE WITH ALICE THAT THE POOR BOY MIGHT BE DISINHERITED BERYL DID NOT DENY THE CHARGE I BELIEVE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH BERNARD YOURSELF HE SAID
8747-293952-0032 NO BERNARD AND I ARE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER BUT HE IS DEAD
8747-293952-0033 LUCY SAT UP ON THE SOFA AND PUSHED THE LOOSE HAIR BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD WHY DO YOU SAY THAT SHE ASKED SHARPLY JULIUS STARED AT THE FIRE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DURHAM'S ATTITUDE HE SAID EVASIVELY
8747-293952-0034 HE MUST KNOW THAT BERNARD IS DEAD SEEING THAT THE COAT AND HAT WERE FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NO MAN COULD HAVE LIVED IN THE COLD AND THE FOG YET IF DURHAM WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ESTATE AGAINST BERNARD'S COMING
8747-293952-0035 MISTER DURHAM REQUIRES PROOF OF THE DEATH REJOINED LUCY SHARPLY AND UNTIL THEN HE IS BOUND TO ADMINISTER THE ESTATE ACCORDING TO THE WILL AS BERNARD'S BODY HAS NOT BEEN FOUND
8747-293952-0036 THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT HE MAY HAVE ESCAPED I SINCERELY TRUST NOT AH YOU ALWAYS HATED BERNARD ON THE CONTRARY I SPEAK FOR HIS GOOD
8747-293952-0037 WHAT'S THE USE OF HIS COMING TO LIFE WHEN HE MUST SUFFER FOR HIS CRIME
8747-293952-0038 YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR SAYING THAT SAID JULIUS PALE WITH RAGE I DON'T NEED GROUNDS RETORTED THE GENUINE WOMAN BERNARD ALWAYS WAS AS KIND HEARTED AS YOU WERE AND ARE THE REVERSE
8747-293952-0039 I AM NOT HARD HEARTED SNAPPED BERYL I ALWAYS DO GOOD
8747-293952-0040 NOT ALWAYS FOR INSTANCE I AM DOWN HERE TO GET A SMALL BOY A POST WITH MISS PLANTAGENET AS A PAGE THAT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID LUCY SCORNFULLY AH YOU SEE I CAN DO A KIND ACTION
8747-293952-0041 THIS BOY IS A GRANDSON OF LORD CONNISTON'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS MOON AT COVE CASTLE SAID LUCY WITH SOME COLOR IN HER FACE I KNOW DO YOU KNOW LORD CONNISTON ASKED JULIUS SUSPICIOUSLY I HAVE MET HIM ONCE
8747-293952-0042 HE SEEMS TO BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL FELLOW WHAT A DELIGHTFUL SPEECH FOR A LADY SAID BERYL CONNISTON IS A SCAMP I HEARD HE ENLISTED IN THE LANCERS IT SHOWS HOW BRAVE HE IS EVERY MAN WORTH CALLING A MAN
8747-293952-0043 SHOULD GO TO THE FRONT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO GO SNEERED JULIUS YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PLUCK SAID LUCY QUICKLY ALL YOUR ENDS IN LIFE ARE GAINED BY CUNNING
8747-293952-0044 LUCY IF YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT BEGAN BERYL AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT IT IS NO USE OUR QUARRELLING LET ME SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT SO CARELESS OF OTHERS OR SO HARD HEARTED AS I SEEM TO BE
8747-293952-0045 MISS PLANTAGENET WANTS A PAGE I FOUND THIS LAD IN LONDON SELLING MATCHES HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY AT A TOBACCONIST CALLED TABERLEY AND LORD CONNISTON GOT HIM TURNED OUT OF THE SITUATION
8747-293952-0046 THE BOY TOLD ME HIMSELF HE WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM LORD CONNISTON IS TOO KIND A MAN TO BEHAVE IN THAT WAY HE WAS FOND OF BERNARD
8747-293952-0047 AND THAT MAKES HIM PERFECT IN YOUR EYES SAID BERYL LOOKING SAVAGE SEE HERE LUCY CONNISTON HAS LEFT THE ARMY SO YOU SEE HE IS NOT SO BRAVE AS YOU THINK
8747-293952-0048 HE LEFT SO AS TO SEEK AFTER BERNARD SAID LUCY QUICKLY MISTER DURHAM TOLD ME SO
8747-293952-0049 AND I BELIEVE BERNARD MAY BE ALIVE AFTER ALL IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD GIVE HIM UP TO THE POLICE NO SAID JULIUS WITH AN EMOTION WHICH DID HIM CREDIT I SHOULD NEVER BETRAY HIM
8747-293952-0050 LUCY IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM LORD CONNISTON OR DURHAM THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM WHEN YOU BELIEVE HIM GUILTY I MIGHT HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
8747-293952-0051 I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM HANGED HE WON'T BE HANGED IF LORD CONNISTON AND MISTER DURHAM CAN SAVE HIM AH JULIUS STARTED TO HIS FEET THEN HE IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0052 I CAN'T SAY I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK HE IS BUT I AM HOPING AGAINST HOPE SAID LUCY RISING I MERELY STATE WHAT WAS SAID MISTER DURHAM AND LORD CONNISTON BOTH TOLD ALICE THAT BERNARD WAS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0053 THEY WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT SNEERED BERYL WITH A WHITE FACE I BELIEVE THE FELLOW IS ALIVE AFTER ALL
8747-293952-0054 AND THEN ASKED LUCY STARTING UP AND FACING BERYL
8747-293952-0055 AH YOU WOULD MAKE HIM PAY MONEY TO SAVE HIMSELF I HAVE A RIGHT TO A PORTION OF THE ESTATE YOU HAVE NOT SAID MISS RANDOLPH CLENCHING HER FISTS AND ALL HER LANGUOR GONE BERNARD IS THE OWNER OF GORE HALL
8747-293952-0056 AND OF ALL THE PROPERTY AND OF THE TITLE ALSO
8747-293952-0057 HIS NAME WILL BE CLEARED AND THEN YOU WILL THROW ME OVER AND TRY TO BECOME LADY GORE I THROW YOU OVER NOW SAID LUCY LOSING HER TEMPER AND COLORING HOTLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THIS JULIUS
8747-293952-0058 I WILL NO LONGER BE BOUND TO YOU I NEVER LOVED YOU BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE THE BEST SIDE OF YOU BUT YOU HAVE NO GOOD SIDE YOU ARE A MEAN COWARDLY SERPENT AND IF BERNARD IS ALIVE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO DEFEND HIM
8747-293952-0059 FROM YOUR SNARES BUT LUCY DON'T SPEAK TO ME
8747-293952-0060 I GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RING HERE IT IS SHE WRENCHED IT FROM HER FINGER NOW LEAVE THE HOUSE MISTER BERYL I AM MISTRESS HERE JULIUS LOOKED AT THE RING WHICH SHE HAD THROWN AT HIS FEET AND LAUGHED
8747-293952-0061 YOU TAKE A HIGH TONE HE SAID SNEERINGLY BUT REMEMBER THAT IF BERNARD IS DEAD THE MONEY GOES TO CHARITIES SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU DO NOT GET IT NOR YOU EITHER
8747-293952-0062 YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT OF THIS LUXURIOUS HOME AND LIVE ON THE PITTANCE SIR SIMON LEFT YOU WOULD I BE BETTER OFF IF I MARRIED YOU I THINK YOU WOULD I HAVE NOT MUCH MONEY NOW BUT I WILL HAVE SOME
8747-293952-0063 A GREAT DEAL SOME DAY BY BLACKMAILING BERNARD SAID LUCY INDIGNANTLY JULIUS PICKED UP THE RING AND SLIPPED IT INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET CALMLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0064 BUT THE FACT OF CONNISTON LEAVING THE ARMY AND FROM DURHAM'S ATTITUDE I SHREWDLY SUSPECT HE IS AND IN HIDING
8747-293952-0065 AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON HIM WHETHER HE IS HANGED OR PREFERS TO LIVE ABROAD ON A PORTION OF HIS MONEY THE LESSER PORTION I KNOW THE PRICE OF YOUR SILENCE SAID LUCY VEHEMENTLY YOU WILL WANT THE HALL AND A LARGE INCOME
8747-293952-0066 ALL I CAN GET REJOINED BERYL QUIETLY AND YOU HAVE REFUSED TO SHARE MY FORTUNE WITH ME YES I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND REMEMBER THAT IF I CATCH YOU PLOTTING I WILL TELL MISTER DURHAM
8747-293952-0067 YOU CAN TELL HIM THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION SNARLED BERYL I AM NOT AFRAID OF DURHAM IF BERNARD IS ALIVE HE'LL HAVE TO PAY UP OR BE HANGED HE IS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0068 JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED TO THE DOOR THERE HE PAUSED TO UTTER A FINAL INSULTING SPEECH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU INTEND TO MARRY BERNARD OR LORD CONNISTON HE SAID BUT I WISH
8747-293952-0069 WHICH EVER IT IS JOY OF A SPITFIRE AND AN HONEST WOMAN SAID MISS RANDOLPH WRATHFULLY FOR THE REFERENCE TO CONNISTON TOUCHED HER NEARLY
8747-293952-0070 BUT YOU GO TOO FAST YOU CAN'T YET PROVE THAT BERNARD LIVES I GO TO DO SO SNEERED JULIUS AND BOWED HIMSELF IRONICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING LUCY FURIOUS BOTH WITH HIM AND WITH HERSELF
8747-293952-0071 SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT IN SPEAKING OF CONNISTON SHE HAD COLORED AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE GREATLY ADMIRED THE YOUNG LORD EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY MET ONCE
8747-293952-0072 FOR CONNISTON WAS ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE MEN WHO APPEAL TO WOMEN LUCY THOUGHT BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE WHAT SHE THOUGHT ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HER ENGAGEMENT TO JULIUS WHICH HAD ALWAYS WEIGHED ON HER CONSCIENCE WAS AT AN END
8747-293952-0073 I AM FREE NOW FREE SHE SAID STRETCHING HER HANDS OH WHAT AN ESCAPE I HAVE HAD FROM THAT WICKED MAN HE HAS SHOWN HIS HAND TOO PLAINLY I WILL PUT MISTER DURHAM ON HIS GUARD AND
8747-293952-0074 HERE SHE BLUSHED AND LORD CONNISTON JULIUS WALKING TOWARDS THE BOWER WAS ALSO ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AS LUCY THOUGHT HE HAD SHOWN HIS HAND TOO CLEARLY
8747-293952-0075 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE HELD MY TONGUE I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD SHE NOT GOADED ME INTO SPEECH SHE WILL TELL DURHAM AND THAT INTERFERING CONNISTON AND PUT THEM ON THEIR GUARD WELL
8747-293952-0076 HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT THE SMALL BOY TROTTING BESIDE HIM I AM EQUAL TO BOTH THE BOY WAS A HANDSOME INNOCENT LOOKING LITTLE FELLOW RATHER UNDERSIZED
8747-293952-0077 WITH HIS CLEAR SKIN HIS FAIR HAIR AND WIDE BLUE EYES HE LOOKED LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL PICTURE OF A CHERUB
8747-293952-0078 BUT HIS MIND HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO WORK ON HIS FACE AND THE MASK OF HIS CHILDHOOD FOR HE WAS ONLY THIRTEEN CONCEALED HIS EVIL NATURE SUCCESSFULLY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS PASSIONS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MASK HIS FACE
8747-293952-0079 WOULD BE WRINKLED AND SINFUL HIS MIND WOULD HAVE MARKED PLAINLY ITS SIGNET ON THE SMOOTH SURFACE BUT AT PRESENT HE LOOKED CHARMINGLY INNOCENT ALTHOUGH HE ALREADY KNEW MUCH MORE ABOUT LIFE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM
8747-293952-0080 JULIUS IN ORDER THAT THE LAD MIGHT MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON MISS PLANTAGENET HAD DRESSED HIM IN A NEW SUIT AND PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR MUCH OF THE BOY REMAINED IN THIS PRECOCIOUS CRIMINAL YOUNG JERRY TROTTED ALONG SMILING
8747-293952-0081 JERRY SAID BERYL LOOKING DOWN MIND YOU ARE NICE TO THE OLD LADY JERRY TOSSED HIS FAIR CURLS AND LOOKED ROGUISH OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISTER BERYL ALL OLD LADIES TAKE TO ME
8747-293952-0082 THEY THINK I'M A KIND OF HOLY BILL AND I LET THEM THINK SO IT PAYS JERRY YOU ARE A YOUNG SCAMP OF THE WORST THE BOY CHUCKLED AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED A COMPLIMENT I LIKE DOING THINGS HE EXPLAINED FRANKLY IT'S FUN
8747-293952-0083 IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VICTORIA
8747-293952-0084 YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS CORRECTED THE RESPECTABLE MISTER BERYL SEVERELY I KNOW A JOLLY SIGHT MORE THAN YOU THINK SAID THE URCHIN UNDER HIS BREATH AND PRODUCING A CIGARETTE JULIUS TOOK IT FROM HIM
8747-293952-0085 AND DULL SAID JERRY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LORD WHAT A BORE STOPPING WITH HER WILL BE BUT I CAN NIP OVER AND SEE VICTORIA WHEN I LIKE AND KEEP AN EYE ON LORD CONNISTON AS I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0086 I'M FLY SAID MASTER MOON AND BEGAN WHISTLING JULIUS LOOKED AT HIM WITH SATISFACTION HE INTENDED THAT THE BOY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO AS TO KEEP WATCH ON CONNISTON
8747-293952-0087 ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
8747-293952-0088 MISS BERENGARIA WAS AS USUAL IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AFTER THE WELL BEING OF SOME WHITE CHRYSANTHEMUMS SHE RAISED HER HEAD WHEN SHE SAW HER VISITORS AND A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE CROSSED HER FACE WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BERYL
8747-293952-0089 AND BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LET HIM ENTER THE BOWER AS IT WAS AND WITH GREAT DIPLOMACY SO GREAT THAT IT DECEIVED EVEN THE ASTUTE BERYL SHE ASKED HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE
8747-293952-0090 LUCKILY ALICE WAS OUT OF THE WAY HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT BUT SHE WAS EXPECTED BACK MOMENTARILY AND MISS BERENGARIA WISHED TO GET RID OF JULIUS BEFORE THE GIRL RETURNED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONCEAL HER REAL FEELINGS BUT
8747-293952-0091 ALICE BEING SO YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE MIGHT SHOW HER DISLIKE TOO PLAINLY AND PUT BERYL ON HIS GUARD WHO IS THIS YOU HAVE HERE ASKED MISS PLANTAGENET PUTTING ON HER SPECTACLES AND SURVEYING JERRY WITH ADMIRATION WHAT A PRETTY LAD
8747-293952-0092 HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE
8747-293952-0093 A SURE SIGN SHE WAS PERPLEXED MERELY A BOY TO SEE AFTER THE FOWLS AND TO WAIT ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN NECESSARY I LOVE FOWLS SAID JERRY SWEETLY AND LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS A BABE AND DOGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
8747-293952-0094 YOU SEEM A NICE LAD WHO IS HE MISTER BERYL A POOR BOY WHO SOLD MATCHES IN LONDON BUT I DIDN'T ALWAYS PIPED JERRY SHIFTING FROM ONE LEG TO THE OTHER IN FEIGNED EMBARRASSMENT AND PLAYING HIS PART PERFECTLY

8747-293952-0096 HIS LORDSHIP GOT ME A SITUATION AT A TOBACCONIST'S SAID THE CHILD LIKE MOON AND THEN HE GOT ME TURNED OFF WHY THAT IS NOT LIKE LORD CONNISTON
8747-293952-0097 IT IS NOT TO LORD CONNISTON'S CREDIT BUT I MUST KNOW THE REASON SAID THE OLD DAME SHARPLY IF YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THE LAD INTO MY SERVICE JERRY IN ANSWER TO A LOOK OF BERYL'S BEGAN TO WEEP OSTENTATIOUSLY
8747-293952-0098 I SAW HIS LORDSHIP DRESSED AS A SOLDIER HE SNUFFLED AND I TOLD MISTER BERYL HIS LORDSHIP WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE GOT ME TURNED OFF SAYING I WAS UNGRATEFUL
8747-293952-0099 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID MISS BERENGARIA ANGRILY YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL WHAT LORD CONNISTON WISHED KEPT SECRET IT WAS ONLY A FREAK ON HIS PART HE LEFT THE ARMY AT MY REQUEST
8747-293952-0100 AT YOUR REQUEST SAID JULIUS LOOKING AT HER DIRECTLY FOREARMED AS SHE WAS MISS BERENGARIA WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BERNARD'S SECRET FLUSHED THROUGH HER WITHERED SKIN
8747-293952-0101 BUT TURNED THE CONVERSATION DEFIANTLY
8747-293952-0102 YES SWEET LADY DON'T TALK LIKE THAT CHILD CALL ME MA'AM
8747-293952-0103 MISTER BERYL SUCH A KIND GENTLEMAN MA'AM SAID YOU WOULD HELP ME I WILL SO LONG AS YOU ARE HONEST JERRY THRUST HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK BUT JULIUS ANSWERED

8747-293952-0108 I MUST SEE THAT HE DOESN'T SWEAR OR SMOKE OR INDULGE IN ANY OF THOSE WICKED THINGS I HOPE HE WILL DO YOUR RECOMMENDATION CREDIT MISTER BERYL I HOPE HE WILL SAID JULIUS AND FELT A STRONG INCLINATION
8747-293952-0109 THEN HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND THE OLD LADY WATCHED HIM GO
8312-279791-0000 BUT HE WOULD NOT HE HAD SEEN THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT DEFEND HIS PRINCESS HE REFUSED TO LEAVE HER THE TWO RUSHED UPON HER LIKE FURIES HER WONDERFUL BEAUTY AND HER SPLENDID JEWELS STARTLED THEM
8312-279791-0001 AM I LIKELY TO DO THIS I A POOR PRINCESS KEPT IN CAPTIVITY FOR TWO YEARS WITH YOU AS MY GAOLER IN CAPTIVITY REPEATED THE QUEEN WHY THEN DO YOU DRESS YOURSELF SO FINE
8312-279791-0002 AND ADORN YOUR CHAMBER WITH FLOWERS I HAVE LEISURE ENOUGH I MAY JUST AS WELL SPEND SOME OF IT IN ADORNING MYSELF INSTEAD OF BEMOANING MY MISFORTUNE INNOCENT AS I AM INNOCENT INDEED CRIED THE QUEEN
8312-279791-0003 AND BEGAN TO SEARCH THE ROOM IN IT SHE FOUND ALL KING CHARMING'S PRESENTS DIAMONDS RUBIES EMERALDS AMETHYSTS IN SHORT JEWELS WITHOUT END MEANTIME FROM THE WINDOW THE BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0004 WHO HAD THE EYE OF A LYNX SANG ALOUD BEWARE FLORINA YOU SEE MADAM SAID FLORINA EVEN THE SPIRITS OF THE AIR TAKE PITY UPON ME I SEE THAT YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH DEMONS BUT YOUR FATHER SHALL JUDGE YOU
8312-279791-0005 AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED THE QUEEN LEFT HER AND WENT TO HOLD COUNSEL WITH TROUTINA AS TO WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THEY AGREED TO PUT IN FLORINA'S CHAMBER A WAITING MAID WHO SHOULD WATCH HER FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
8312-279791-0006 WHEN THE PRINCESS LEARNT THIS SHE WAS IN GREAT GRIEF ALAS CRIED SHE I CAN NO LONGER TALK WITH MY BIRD WHO LOVED ME SO
8312-279791-0007 BUT THE SERVING MAID WATCHED HER NIGHT AND DAY AT LAST OVERCOME WITH WEARINESS THE GIRL FELL ASLEEP AND THEN FLORINA OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG IN A LOW VOICE BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0008 THE BLUE BIRD FLEW TO THE WINDOW SILL AND THEY LAVISHED ON ONE ANOTHER A HUNDRED CARESSES AND TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAWN NEXT NIGHT IT HAPPENED THE SAME TILL THEY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE WAITING MAID
8312-279791-0009 WHO WARBLED IN HER EAR AND TOUCHED HER GENTLY WITH HIS BEAK THE SPY LISTENED AND HEARD ALL THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH ASTONISHED THAT A PRINCESS COULD BE SO FOND OF A MERE BIRD WHEN DAY CAME
8312-279791-0010 SHE RELATED ALL TO THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE BIRD COULD BE NO OTHER THAN KING CHARMING THEY SENT THE GIRL BACK TOLD HER TO EXPRESS NO CURIOSITY BUT TO FEIGN SLEEP
8312-279791-0011 AND TO GO TO BED EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN THE POOR DECEIVED PRINCESS OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG HER USUAL SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0012 BUT NO BLUE BIRD APPEARED THE QUEEN HAD CAUSED SHARP KNIVES TO BE HUNG OUTSIDE THE HOLLOW OF THE TREE HE FLEW AGAINST THEM AND CUT HIS FEET AND WINGS TILL HE DROPPED DOWN COVERED WITH BLOOD
8312-279791-0013 OH FLORINA COME TO MY HELP SIGHED HE BUT SHE IS DEAD I KNOW AND I WILL DIE ALSO AT THAT MOMENT HIS FRIEND THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0014 HAD GONE EIGHT TIMES ROUND THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HIM MADE HIS NINTH JOURNEY AND CAME TO THE TREE WHERE THE POOR BLUE BIRD LAY CALLING OUT KING CHARMING KING CHARMING THE KING RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF HIS BEST FRIEND
8312-279791-0015 WHY CAN I NOT RETURN AND GOVERN IT AS BEFORE I FEAR REPLIED HIS FRIEND THAT THE THING IS DIFFICULT WHO WOULD OBEY A BLUE BIRD AH THAT IS TOO TRUE CRIED THE KING SADLY
8312-279791-0016 PEOPLE ONLY JUDGE BY THE OUTSIDE MEANTIME FLORINA OVERCOME WITH GRIEF FELL DANGEROUSLY SICK AND IN HER SICKNESS SHE KEPT SINGING DAY AND NIGHT HER LITTLE SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0017 COME TO MY SIDE BUT NO ONE REGARDED HER AT LAST A SUDDEN CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN HER FORTUNES THE KING HER FATHER DIED AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW SHE WAS HIS HEIR BEGAN TO INQUIRE WITH ONE ACCORD
8312-279791-0018 WHERE WAS THE PRINCESS FLORINA THEY ASSAILED THE PALACE IN CROWDS DEMANDING HER FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN THE RIOT BECAME SO DANGEROUS THAT TROUTINA AND HER MOTHER FLED AWAY TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0019 RESTORED FLORINA'S HEALTH AND GAVE HER STRENGTH TO CALL A COUNCIL AND ARRANGE ALL THE AFFAIRS OF HER KINGDOM THEN SHE DEPARTED BY NIGHT AND ALONE TO GO OVER THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HER BLUE BIRD THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0020 WHO WAS KING CHARMING'S FRIEND WENT TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO WHOM HE KNEW FOR THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND MADE IT UP AGAIN AS FAIRIES AND MAGICIANS DO MANY TIMES WITHIN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS
8312-279791-0021 SHE RECEIVED HIM CIVILLY AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED HE TRIED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH HER BUT COULD EFFECT NOTHING UNLESS KING CHARMING WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY TROUTINA THE ENCHANTER FOUND THIS BRIDE SO UGLY
8312-279791-0022 THAT HE COULD NOT ADVISE STILL THE BLUE BIRD HAD RUN SO MANY RISKS IN HIS CAGE THE NAIL IT WAS HUNG UPON HAD BROKEN AND THE KING SUFFERED MUCH IN THE FALL MINETTA THE CAT HAD GLOWERED AT HIM WITH HER GREEN EYES
8312-279791-0023 HE HAD BEEN A LINNET OR A JAY WORSE THAN ALL HIS NEXT HEIR SPREAD REPORTS OF HIS DEATH
8312-279791-0024 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE MAGICIAN THOUGHT IT BEST TO AGREE WITH SOUSSIO THAT KING CHARMING SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIS KINGDOM AND HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SIX MONTHS ON CONDITION THAT TROUTINA SHOULD REMAIN IN HIS PALACE
8312-279791-0025 BUT HE THOUGHT LESS OF THESE THINGS THAN HOW TO ESCAPE FROM THE HORROR OF MARRYING TROUTINA MEANWHILE THE QUEEN FLORINA IN A PEASANT'S DRESS WITH A STRAW HAT ON HER HEAD AND A CANVAS SACK ON HER SHOULDER
8312-279791-0026 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ALL ALONE GOOD MOTHER REPLIED THE QUEEN I HAVE TOO MANY TROUBLES TO BE PLEASANT COMPANY FOR ANYBODY TELL ME YOUR TROUBLES AND I MAY BE ABLE TO SOFTEN THEM
8312-279791-0027 DO NOT AFFLICT YOURSELF HAPPINESS WILL YET BE YOURS TAKE THESE FOUR EGGS AND WHENEVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE BREAK THEM AND SEE WHAT ENSUES SO SAYING THE FAIRY VANISHED FLORINA
8312-279791-0028 GREATLY COMFORTED PUT THE EGGS IN HER SACK
8312-279791-0029 SHE WALKED EIGHT DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT STOPPING AND THEN CAME TO A MOUNTAIN MADE ENTIRELY OF IVORY AND NEARLY PERPENDICULAR DESPAIRING OF EVER CLIMBING IT
8312-279791-0030 SHE SANK DOWN AT THE FOOT PREPARED TO DIE THERE WHEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF THE EGGS LET ME SEE SAID SHE IF THE FAIRY HAS DECEIVED ME OR NOT SO SHE BROKE ONE AND INSIDE IT WERE LITTLE HOOKS OF GOLD
8312-279791-0031 WHICH SHE FITTED ON HER FEET AND HANDS AND BY MEANS OF WHICH SHE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN WITH EASE ARRIVED AT THE SUMMIT SHE FOUND NEW DIFFICULTIES FOR THE VALLEY BELOW WAS ONE LARGE SMOOTH MIRROR
8312-279791-0032 IN WHICH SIXTY THOUSAND WOMEN STOOD ADMIRING THEMSELVES THEY HAD NEED FOR THE CHARM OF THE MIRROR WAS THAT EACH SAW HERSELF THEREIN NOT AS SHE WAS BUT AS SHE WISHED TO BE
8312-279791-0033 AND THE GRIMACES THEY MADE WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A PERSON TO DIE OF LAUGHTER NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER GAINED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN THEY SAW FLORINA THERE THEY ALL BURST INTO ANGRY OUTCRIES
8312-279791-0034 WILL YOU CONVEY ME TO THE PALACE OF KING CHARMING THE OBEDIENT PIGEONS DID SO FLYING DAY AND NIGHT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY GATES WHEN THE QUEEN DISMISSED THEM WITH A SWEET KISS WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN HER CROWN
8312-279791-0035 BESIDES HE IS GOING TO MORROW TO THE TEMPLE WITH THE PRINCESS TROUTINA WHOM HE HAS AT LAST AGREED TO MARRY FLORINA SAT DOWN ON A DOOR STEP AND HID HER FACE UNDER HER STRAW HAT AND HER DROOPING HAIR
8312-279791-0036 ALAS SHE CRIED MY BLUE BIRD HAS FORSAKEN ME SHE NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT BUT ROSE WITH THE DAWN AND PUSHED HER WAY THROUGH THE GUARDS TO THE TEMPLE WHERE SHE SAW TWO THRONES ONE FOR KING CHARMING
8312-279791-0037 AND THE OTHER FOR TROUTINA THEY ARRIVED SHORTLY HE MORE CHARMING AND SHE MORE REPULSIVE THAN EVER KNITTING HER BROWS TROUTINA EXCLAIMED WHAT CREATURE IS THAT WHO DARES APPROACH SO NEAR MY GOLDEN THRONE
8312-279791-0038 THESE ARE PRETTY TRINKETS SAID TROUTINA AND GOING UP TO THE KING SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THEM AT SIGHT OF THE ORNAMENTS HE TURNED PALE REMEMBERING THOSE HE HAD GIVEN TO FLORINA
8312-279791-0039 THESE BRACELETS ARE WORTH HALF MY KINGDOM I DID NOT THINK THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONE PAIR IN THE WORLD THEN I WILL BUY THESE SAID TROUTINA BUT FLORINA REFUSED TO SELL THEM FOR MONEY
8312-279791-0040 THE PRICE SHE ASKED WAS PERMISSION TO SLEEP A NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AS YOU WILL YOUR BARGAINS ARE CHEAP ENOUGH REPLIED TROUTINA LAUGHING AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED SHE SHOWED TEETH LIKE THE TUSKS OF A WILD BOAR
8312-279791-0041 NOW THE KING WHEN HE WAS A BLUE BIRD HAD INFORMED FLORINA ABOUT THIS CHAMBER OF ECHOES WHERE EVERY WORD SPOKEN COULD BE HEARD IN HIS OWN CHAMBER
8312-279791-0042 BUT SHE HAD NO MORE JEWELS TO TEMPT TROUTINA SO SHE BROKE THE THIRD EGG OUT OF IT CAME A CHARIOT OF POLISHED STEEL INLAID WITH GOLD DRAWN BY SIX GREEN MICE THE COACHMAN BEING A ROSE COLOURED RAT
8312-279791-0043 AND THE POSTILION A GREY ONE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE SAT LITTLE PUPPETS WHO BEHAVED THEMSELVES JUST LIKE LIVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHEN TROUTINA WENT TO WALK IN THE PALACE GARDEN FLORINA AWAITED HER IN A GREEN ALLEY
8312-279791-0044 AND MADE THE MICE GALLOP AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOW TILL THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED AND READY TO BUY THE CURIOSITY AT ANY PRICE AGAIN FLORINA EXACTED PERMISSION TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AND AGAIN THE KING
8312-279791-0045 UNDISTURBED BY HER LAMENTATION SLEPT WITHOUT WAKING TILL DAWN THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE PALACE VALETS PASSING HER BY SAID YOU STUPID PEASANT GIRL IT IS WELL THE KING TAKES OPIUM EVERY NIGHT
8312-279791-0046 OR YOU WOULD DISTURB HIM BY THAT TERRIBLE SOBBING OF YOURS DOES HE SO SAID THE QUEEN NOW COMPREHENDING ALL THEN IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO NIGHT TO KEEP THE OPIUM CUP OUT OF HIS WAY THESE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS
8312-279791-0047 AND SHE TOOK A HANDFUL OF THEM FROM HER SACK SHALL ASSUREDLY BE YOURS THE VALET PROMISED AND THEN FLORINA BROKE HER FOURTH EGG OUT OF WHICH CAME A PIE COMPOSED OF BIRDS WHICH THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PLUCKED
8312-279791-0048 BAKED AND MADE READY FOR THE TABLE SANG AS BEAUTIFULLY AS BIRDS THAT ARE ALIVE TROUTINA CHARMED WITH THIS MARVELLOUS NOVELTY BOUGHT IT AT THE SAME PRICE AS THE REST ADDING GENEROUSLY A SMALL PIECE OF GOLD
8312-279791-0049 THEN HE ROSE UP DRESSED HIMSELF HASTILY AND WENT IN SEARCH OF HER SHE WAS SITTING MOURNFULLY ON THE FLOOR WITH HER HAIR HIDING HER FACE AND HER EYES SWOLLEN WITH TEARS BUT HE KNEW AT ONCE HIS FAITHFUL FLORINA
8312-279791-0050 AND THEY EMBRACED AND WEPT TOGETHER FOR WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF ALL THEIR LOVE WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE POWER OF THE FAIRY SOUSSIO BUT AT THIS MOMENT APPEARED THE FRIENDLY ENCHANTER WITH A FAIRY STILL GREATER THAN SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0051 THE ONE WHO HAD GIVEN FLORINA THE FOUR EGGS THEY DECLARED THAT THEIR UNITED POWER WAS STRONGER THAN SOUSSIO'S AND THAT THE LOVERS SHOULD BE MARRIED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED TROUTINA SHE RAN TO THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES
8312-279791-0052 AND THERE BEHELD HER BEAUTIFUL RIVAL WHOM SHE HAD SO CRUELLY AFFLICTED BUT THE MOMENT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SPEAK HER WICKED TONGUE WAS SILENCED FOR EVER FOR THE MAGICIAN TURNED HER INTO A TROUT WHICH HE FLUNG OUT OF THE WINDOW
8312-279791-0053 THIS FAMILY LIKENESS MAY BE TRACED IN THE FAIRY TALES OF ALL COUNTRIES I MERELY REFER TO IT TO SHOW THAT THE REPETITION OF INCIDENTS WAS NOT UNOBSERVED OR UNINTENTIONAL
1594-135914-0000 IN THIS MISERABLE STATE THEY CAME TO THE FIRST VILLAGE THE PEASANTS WIVES FLOCKED ABOUT THEM AND AS IT APPEARED THROUGH THEIR DISGUISE THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE OF SOME CONDITION ASKED THEM WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF THEIR TRAVELLING IN A HABIT THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO THEM
1594-135914-0001 INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION THEY FELL TO WEEPING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE PEASANTS AND TO MOVE THEIR COMPASSION GANEM'S MOTHER TOLD THEM WHAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAD ENDURED AT WHICH THE GOOD COUNTRYWOMEN WERE SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1594-135914-0002 AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
1594-135914-0003 JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER DEPARTED FROM THAT VILLAGE TAKING SHORT JOURNEYS TOWARDS ALEPPO THEY USED AT DUSK TO RETIRE NEAR OR INTO THE MOSQUES WHERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT ON THE MAT IF THERE WAS ANY
1594-135914-0004 OR ELSE ON THE BARE PAVEMENT AND SOMETIMES RESTED IN THE PUBLIC PLACES APPOINTED FOR THE USE OF TRAVELLERS AS FOR SUSTENANCE THEY DID NOT WANT FOR THEY OFTEN CAME TO PLACES WHERE BREAD BOILED RICE AND OTHER PROVISIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL TRAVELLERS WHO DESIRE IT
1594-135914-0005 AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO ALEPPO BUT WOULD NOT STAY THERE AND CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE EUPHRATES CROSSED THE RIVER
1594-135914-0006 THENCE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEY HAD ENDURED THEY PROCEEDED TO BAGDAD THAT WAS THE PLACE THEY HAD FIXED THEIR THOUGHTS UPON
1594-135914-0007 BUT THEY HOPED BECAUSE THEY WISHED IT THEIR AFFECTION FOR HIM INCREASING INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING WITH THEIR MISFORTUNES THEIR CONVERSATION WAS GENERALLY ABOUT HIM AND THEY INQUIRED FOR HIM OF ALL THEY MET BUT LET US LEAVE JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER
1594-135914-0008 AND RETURN TO FETNAH SHE WAS STILL CONFINED CLOSELY IN THE DARK TOWER SINCE THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL TO GANEM AND HERSELF HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE AS HER PRISON WAS TO HER IT WAS MUCH LESS GRIEVOUS THAN THE THOUGHTS OF GANEM'S MISFORTUNE
1594-135914-0009 THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHOSE FATE WAS A KILLING AFFLICTION THERE WAS SCARCELY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE DID NOT LAMENT HIM
1594-135914-0010 AND SOMETIMES BY THOSE NIGHT WALKS CAME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN HIS COURT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE REACHED HIS EAR ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS IN HIS WALK HE HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE DARK TOWER AND FANCYING HE HEARD SOMEBODY TALK
1594-135914-0011 STOPS AND DRAWING NEAR THE DOOR TO LISTEN DISTINCTLY HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH FETNAH WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON GANEM UTTERED WITH A LOUD VOICE O GANEM TOO UNFORTUNATE GANEM WHERE ARE YOU AT THIS TIME
1594-135914-0012 WHITHER HAS THY CRUEL FATE LED THEE ALAS IT IS I THAT HAVE MADE YOU WRETCHED WHY DID YOU NOT LET ME PERISH MISERABLY RATHER THAN AFFORD ME YOUR GENEROUS RELIEF WHAT MELANCHOLY RETURN HAVE YOU RECEIVED FOR YOUR CARE AND RESPECT
1594-135914-0013 THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO OUGHT TO HAVE REWARDED PERSECUTES YOU AND IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING ALWAYS REGARDED ME AS A PERSON RESERVED FOR HIS BED YOU LOSE YOUR FORTUNE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
1594-135914-0014 HOW CAN YOU EXCULPATE YOURSELF WHEN YOU SHALL APPEAR WITH GANEM BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE SUPREME JUDGE AND THE ANGELS SHALL TESTIFY THE TRUTH BEFORE YOUR FACE ALL THE POWER YOU ARE NOW INVESTED WITH AND WHICH MAKES ALMOST THE WHOLE WORLD TREMBLE
1594-135914-0015 WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
1594-135914-0016 HE PLAINLY PERCEIVED THAT IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS TRUE HIS FAVOURITE MUST BE INNOCENT AND THAT HE HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN GIVING SUCH ORDERS AGAINST GANEM AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0017 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE RESPECTED FETNAH AND HAD BEEN MUCH CONCERNED AT HER DISGRACE THEREFORE FLYING INSTANTLY TO THE TOWER MADAM SAID HE TO THE FAVOURITE WITH SUCH AN AIR AS EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION BE PLEASED TO FOLLOW ME
1594-135914-0018 I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER MORE RETURN TO THIS MELANCHOLY ABODE THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I DRAW FROM THIS A HAPPY OMEN
1594-135914-0019 SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HIM AND SO CONTINUED HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS
1594-135914-0020 I THINK YOU CHARGE ME WITH VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WHO IS HE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE REGARD AND RESPELL HE HAD FOR ME IS IN A MISERABLE CONDITION SPEAK FREELY
1594-135914-0021 YOU KNOW THE NATURAL GOODNESS OF MY DISPOSITION AND THAT I LOVE TO DO JUSTICE BY THESE WORDS
1594-135914-0022 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE IF I HAVE LET FALL ANY WORD THAT IS NOT AGREEABLE TO YOUR MAJESTY I MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT HE WHOSE INNOCENCE AND WRETCHED STATE YOU DESIRE TO BE INFORMED OF
1594-135914-0023 IS GANEM THE UNHAPPY SON OF ABOU AYOUB LATE A RICH MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS HE SAVED MY LIFE FROM A GRAVE AND AFFORDED ME A SANCTUARY IN HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0024 I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
1594-135914-0025 AND DOING ME ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I SO MUCH WANTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS THEN IN BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I HAD THE HONOUR TO BELONG TO YOU AH MADAM SAID HE THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE FROM THAT MOMENT
1594-135914-0026 I OWE THIS JUSTICE TO HIS VIRTUE TO DECLARE HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS ALWAYS SUITABLE TO HIS WORDS YOU COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WELL KNOW WITH WHAT RIGOUR YOU HAVE TREATED HIM AND YOU WILL ANSWER FOR IT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF GOD
1594-135914-0027 I MUST MAKE A CONFESSION WHICH PERHAPS MAY DISPLEASE YOU BUT I BEG PARDON OF YOUR MAJESTY BEFOREHAND SPEAK DAUGHTER SAID HAROON AL RUSHEED I FORGIVE YOU ALL PROVIDED YOU CONCEAL NOTHING FROM ME WELL THEN REPLIED FETNAH
1594-135914-0028 LET ME INFORM YOU THAT GANEM'S RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOUR JOINED TO ALL THE GOOD OFFICES HE DID ME GAINED HIM MY ESTEEM I WENT FURTHER YET YOU KNOW THE TYRANNY OF LOVE I FELT SOME TENDER INCLINATION RISING IN MY BREAST
1594-135914-0029 HE PERCEIVED IT BUT FAR FROM AVAILING HIMSELF OF MY FRAILTY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FLAME WHICH CONSUMED HIM HE STILL REMAINED STEADY IN HIS DUTY AND ALL THAT HIS PASSION COULD FORCE FROM HIM WERE THE WORDS I HAVE ALREADY REPEATED TO YOUR MAJESTY
1594-135914-0030 THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE THIS INGENUOUS CONFESSION
1594-135914-0031 AND ENLARGING ON THE OBLIGATIONS SHE OWED TO GANEM BUT ABOVE ALL SHE HIGHLY EXTOLLED HIS DISCRETION
1594-135914-0032 WHEN SHE HAD DONE SPEAKING
1594-135914-0033 I BELIEVE ALL YOU HAVE TOLD ME BUT WHY WAS IT SO LONG BEFORE YOU LET ME HEAR FROM YOU WAS THERE ANY NEED OF STAYING A WHOLE MONTH AFTER MY RETURN BEFORE YOU SENT ME WORD WHERE YOU WERE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED FETNAH
1594-135914-0034 GANEM WENT ABROAD SO VERY SELDOM THAT YOU NEED NOT WONDER WE WERE NOT THE FIRST THAT HEARD OF YOUR RETURN BESIDES GANEM WHO TOOK UPON HIM TO DELIVER THE LETTER I WROTE TO NOURON NIHAR
1594-135914-0035 WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING IT INTO HER OWN HANDS IT IS ENOUGH FETNAH
1594-135914-0036 I ACKNOWLEDGE MY FAULT AND WOULD WILLINGLY MAKE AMENDS FOR IT BY HEAPING FAVOURS ON THE YOUNG MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS CONSIDER THEREFORE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HIM ASK WHAT YOU THINK FIT AND I WILL GRANT IT
1594-135914-0037 AND RISING AGAIN SAID COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS AFTER RETURNING YOUR MAJESTY THANKS FOR GANEM I MOST HUMBLY ENTREAT YOU TO CAUSE IT TO BE PUBLISHED THROUGHOUT YOUR DO MINIONS THAT YOU PARDON THE SON OF ABOU AYOUB AND THAT HE MAY SAFELY COME TO YOU
1594-135914-0038 I MUST DO MORE REJOINED THE PRINCE IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING SAVED YOUR LIFE AND THE RESPECT HE HAS STREWN FOR ME TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE LOSS OF HIS FORTUNE IN SHORT TO REPAIR THE WRONG I HAVE DONE TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0039 I GIVE HIM TO YOU FOR A HUSBAND
1594-135914-0040 SHE THEN WITHDREW INTO THE APARTMENT SHE HAD OCCUPIED BEFORE HER MELANCHOLY ADVENTURE
1594-135914-0041 SHE SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AND THE THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD IN GIVING ALMS AT THE MOSQUES AND RETURNED TO THE PALACE IN THE EVENING
1594-135914-0042 THE NEXT DAY SHE TOOK ANOTHER PURSE OF THE SAME VALUE AND IN THE LIKE EQUIPAGE AS THE DAY BEFORE WENT TO THE SQUARE OF THE JEWELLERS SHOPS AND STOPPING AT THE GATEWAY WITHOUT ALIGHTING SENT ONE OF HER BLACK EUNUCHS FOR THE SYNDIC OR CHIEF OF THEM
1594-135914-0043 THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MOST CHARITABLE MAN AND SPENT ABOVE TWO THIRDS OF HIS INCOME IN RELIEVING POOR STRANGERS SICK OR IN DISTRESS DID NOT MAKE FETNAH WAIT KNOWING BY HER DRESS THAT SHE WAS A LADY BELONGING TO THE PALACE I APPLY MYSELF TO YOU SAID SHE
1594-135914-0044 PUTTING THE PURSE INTO HIS HANDS AS A PERSON WHOSE PIETY IS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE CITY I DESIRE YOU TO DISTRIBUTE THAT GOLD AMONG THE POOR STRANGERS YOU RELIEVE FOR I KNOW YOU MAKE IT YOUR BUSINESS TO ASSIST THOSE WHO APPLY TO YOUR CHARITY
1594-135914-0045 I AM ALSO SATISFIED THAT YOU PREVENT THEIR WANTS AND THAT NOTHING IS MORE GRATEFUL TO YOU THAN TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF RELIEVING THEIR MISERY MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC I SHALL OBEY YOUR COMMANDS WITH PLEASURE BUT IF YOU DESIRE TO EXERCISE YOUR CHARITY IN PERSON
1594-135914-0046 AND WILL BE PLEASED TO STEP TO MY HOUSE
1594-135914-0047 I MET THEM YESTERDAY AS THEY WERE COMING INTO THE CITY THEY WERE IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND IT MOVED ME THE MORE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE PERSONS OF RANK THROUGH ALL THE RAGS THAT COVERED THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPRESSION THE SUN HAS MADE ON THEIR FACES
1594-135914-0048 WHILST SHE HERSELF LED THEM TO OUR WARM BATH AND GAVE THEM CLEAN LINEN
1594-135914-0049 BECAUSE WE WISH TO LET THEM TAKE SOME REST BEFORE WE TROUBLE THEM WITH OUR QUESTIONS FETNAH WITHOUT KNOWING WHY FELT A CURIOSITY TO SEE THEM THE SYNDIC WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER TO HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0050 FOR THEY WERE THE PERSONS THE SYNDIC HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF TO FETNAH THE SYNDIC'S WIFE BEING INFORMED BY THE SLAVE THAT A LADY FROM THE PALACE WAS IN HER HOUSE WAS HASTENING TO MEET HER BUT FETNAH WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE SLAVE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME
1594-135914-0051 ON HER COMING INTO THE CHAMBER THE SYNDIC'S WIFE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HER
1594-135914-0052 FETNAH RAISED HER UP AND SAID MY GOOD LADY
1594-135914-0053 MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC'S WIFE THEY LIE IN THOSE BEDS YOU SEE BY EACH OTHER
1594-135914-0054 GOOD WOMAN SAID SHE I COME TO OFFER YOU MY ASSISTANCE I HAVE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CITY AND MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU AND YOUR COMPANION MADAM ANSWERED GANEM'S MOTHER
1594-135914-0055 THAT FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC'S WIFE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS
1594-135914-0056 SAID TO GANEM'S MOTHER BE SO KIND AS TO TELL US YOUR MISFORTUNES AND RECOUNT YOUR STORY YOU CANNOT MAKE THE RELATION TO ANY PERSONS BETTER DISPOSED TO USE ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO COMFORT YOU
1594-135914-0057 MADAM REPLIED ABOU AYOUB'S DISCONSOLATE WIDOW A FAVOURITE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS A LADY WHOSE NAME IS FETNAH IS THE OCCASION OF ALL OUR MISFORTUNES THESE WORDS WERE LIKE A THUNDERBOLT TO THE FAVOURITE
1594-135914-0058 BUT SUPPRESSING HER AGITATION AND CONCERN SHE SUFFERED GANEM'S MOTHER TO PROCEED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
1594-135914-0059 I HAD A SON CALLED GANEM WHO COMING TO TRADE AT BAGDAD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF CARRYING OFF FETNAH
1594-135914-0060 AND THEN TO BANISH US OUT OF SYRIA FOR EVER BUT HOW UNWORTHY SOEVER OUR USAGE HAS BEEN
1594-135914-0061 WHAT A PLEASURE WOULD IT BE FOR HIS SISTER AND ME TO SEE HIM AGAIN EMBRACING HIM WE SHOULD FORGET THE LOSS OF OUR PROPERTY AND ALL THE EVILS WE HAVE SUFFERED ON HIS ACCOUNT ALAS
1594-135914-0062 NO DOUBT OF IT SAID FETNAH INTERRUPTING HER THERE HE IS NO MORE GUILTY THAN YOU ARE I CAN ASSURE YOU OF HIS INNOCENCE FOR I AM THAT VERY FETNAH YOU SO MUCH COMPLAIN OF WHO THROUGH SOME FATALITY IN MY STARS
1594-135914-0063 HAVE OCCASIONED YOU SO MANY MISFORTUNES TO ME YOU MUST IMPUTE THE LOSS OF YOUR SON IF HE IS NO MORE BUT IF I HAVE OCCASIONED YOUR MISFORTUNE I CAN IN SOME MEASURE RELIEVE IT
1594-135914-0064 AND DOUBT NOT HE WILL DO YOU AS MUCH GOOD AS HE HAS DONE YOU INJURY YOU ARE NO LONGER HIS ENEMIES HE WAITS FOR GANEM TO REQUITE THE SERVICE HE HAS DONE ME BY UNITING OUR FORTUNES HE GIVES ME TO HIM FOR HIS CONSORT
1594-135914-0065 THEREFORE LOOK ON ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER AND PERMIT ME TO VOW ETERNAL DUTY AND AFFECTION HAVING SO SAID SHE BOWED DOWN ON GANEM'S MOTHER WHO WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD RETURN NO ANSWER
1594-135914-0066 FETNAH HELD HER LONG IN HER ARMS AND ONLY LEFT HER TO EMBRACE THE DAUGHTER WHO SITTING UP
1594-135914-0067 THE WEALTH GANEM HAD IN THIS CITY IS NOT LOST IT IS IN MY APARTMENT IN THE PALACE BUT I KNOW ALL THE TREASURE OF THE WORLD CANNOT COMFORT YOU WITHOUT GANEM IF I MAY JUDGE OF YOU BY MYSELF BLOOD IS NO LESS POWERFUL THAN LOVE IN GREAT MINDS
1594-135914-0068 BUT WHY SHOULD WE DESPAIR OF SEEING HIM AGAIN WE SHALL FIND HIM THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING WITH YOU MAKES ME CONCEIVE FRESH HOPES PERHAPS THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF YOUR SUFFERINGS AND THE BEGINNING OF A GREATER FELICITY THAN YOU ENJOYED IN DAMASCUS
1594-135914-0069 WHEN GANEM WAS WITH YOU FETNAH WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED BUT THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS COMING IN INTERRUPTED HER MADAM SAID HE TO HER I COME FROM SEEING A VERY MOVING OBJECT IT IS A YOUNG MAN WHOM A CAMEL DRIVER HAD JUST CARRIED TO AN HOSPITAL
1594-135914-0070 HE WAS BOUND WITH CORDS ON A CAMEL BECAUSE HE HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO SIT THEY HAD ALREADY UNBOUND HIM AND WERE CARRYING HIM INTO THE HOSPITAL WHEN I HAPPENED TO PASS BY I WENT UP TO THE YOUNG MAN VIEWED HIM ATTENTIVELY
1594-135914-0071 AND FANCIED HIS COUNTENANCE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN TO ME I ASKED HIM SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING HIS FAMILY AND HIS COUNTRY BUT ALL THE ANSWERS I COULD GET WERE SIGHS AND TEARS I TOOK PITY ON HIM
1594-135914-0072 PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR CARE TAKEN OF HIM I WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO BE PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR WAY OF MANAGING THE SICK AND AM SENSIBLE OF THE INCAPACITY OF THE PHYSICIANS
1594-135914-0073 I HAVE CAUSED HIM TO BE BROUGHT TO MY OWN HOUSE BY MY SLAVES AND THEY ARE NOW IN A PRIVATE ROOM WHERE I PLACED HIM PUTTING ON SOME OF MY OWN LINEN AND TREATING HIM AS THEY WOULD DO MYSELF FETNAH'S HEART BEAT AT THESE WORDS OF THE JEWELLER
1594-135914-0074 AND SHE FELT A SUDDEN EMOTION FOR WHICH SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT SHEW ME SAID SHE TO THE SYNDIC INTO THE SICK MAN'S ROOM I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM THE SYNDIC CONDUCTED HER AND WHILST SHE WAS GOING THITHER
1594-135914-0075 WHOSE EYES WERE CLOSED HIS COUNTENANCE PALE DISFIGURED AND BATHED IN TEARS SHE GAZED EARNESTLY ON HIM HER HEART BEAT AND SHE FANCIED SHE BEHELD GANEM BUT YET SHE WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER EYES
1594-135914-0076 THOUGH SHE FOUND SOMETHING OF GANEM IN THE OBJETS SHE BEHELD YET IN OTHER RESPECTS HE APPEARED SO DIFFERENT THAT SHE DURST NOT IMAGINE IT WAS HE THAT LAY BEFORE HER UNABLE HOWEVER TO WITHSTAND THE EARNEST DESIRE OF BEING SATISFIED
1594-135914-0077 GANEM SAID SHE WITH A TREMBLING VOICE IS IT YOU I BEHOLD HAVING SPOKEN THESE WORDS SHE STOPPED TO GIVE THE YOUNG MAN TIME TO ANSWER BUT OBSERVING THAT HE SEEMED INSENSIBLE ALAS GANEM ADDED SHE
1594-135914-0078 IT IS NOT YOU THAT I ADDRESS MY IMAGINATION BEING OVERCHARGED WITH YOUR IMAGE HAS GIVEN TO A STRANGER A DECEITFUL RESEMBLANCE
1594-135914-0079 HOWEVER INDISPOSED WOULD KNOW THE VOICE OF FETNAH AT THE NAME OF FETNAH GANEM FOR IT WAS REALLY HE
1594-135914-0080 AH MADAM SAID HE BY WHAT MIRACLE HE COULD SAY NO MORE SUCH A SUDDEN TRANSPORT OF JOY SEIZED HIM THAT HE FAINTED AWAY FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC DID ALL THEY COULD TO BRING HIM TO HIMSELF
1594-135914-0081 BUT AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED HE BEGAN TO REVIVE THE SYNDIC DESIRED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW LEST THE SIGHT OF HER SHOULD HEIGHTEN HIS DISORDER THE YOUNG MAN HAVING RECOVERED LOOKED ALL AROUND AND NOT SEEING WHAT HE SOUGHT EXCLAIMED
1594-135914-0082 WHAT IS BECOME OF YOU CHARMING FETNAH DID YOU REALLY APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES OR WAS IT ONLY AN ILLUSION NO SIR SAID THE SYNDIC IT WAS NO ILLUSION IT WAS I THAT CAUSED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW
1594-135914-0083 BUT YOU SHALL SEE HER AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN A CONDITION TO BEAR THE INTERVIEW YOU NOW STAND IN NEED OF REST AND NOTHING OUGHT TO OBSTRUCT YOUR TAKING IT THE SITUATION OF YOUR AFFAIRS IS ALTERED SINCE YOU ARE AS I SUPPOSE THAT GANEM
1594-135914-0084 IN FAVOUR OF WHOM THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS HAS CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE MADE IN BAGDAD DECLARING THAT HE FORGIVES HIM WHAT IS PASSED BE SATISFIED FOR THE PRESENT WITH KNOWING SO MUCH
1594-135914-0085 THE LADY WHO JUST NOW SPOKE TO YOU WILL ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE REST THEREFORE THINK OF NOTHING BUT RECOVERING YOUR HEALTH I WILL CONTRIBUTE ALL IN MY POWER TOWARDS IT HAVING SPOKE THESE WORDS HE LEFT GANEM TO TAKE HIS REST
1594-135914-0086 EXHAUSTED BY HARD LIVING AND TOIL
1594-135914-0087 THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THE SYNDIC'S SAYING ANY MORE TO GANEM'S MOTHER AS SOON AS SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE COULD NOT CONVERSE WITH HER SON WITHOUT HAZARDING HIS LIFE SHE CEASED INSISTING TO GO AND SEE HIM
1594-135914-0088 FETNAH THEN SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN FOR HAVING BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER
1594-135914-0089 AND TOMORROW MORNING I WILL RETURN TO YOU THIS SAID SHE EMBRACED THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AND WENT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE PALACE
1594-135914-0090 WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY GRANTED AND BEING BROUGHT INTO THE PRINCE'S CLOSET WHERE HE WAS ALONE SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF AT HIS FEET WITH HER FACE ON THE GROUND ACCORDING TO CUSTOM HE COMMANDED HER TO RISE AND HAVING MADE HER SIT DOWN ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD HEARD ANY NEWS OF GANEM
1594-135914-0091 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE I HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM AND ALSO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
1594-135914-0092 AND SHE SATISFIED HIS INQUIRIES SAYING SO MANY THINGS IN COMMENDATION OF GANEM'S MOTHER AND SISTER HE DESIRED TO SEE THEM AS WELL AS THE YOUNG MERCHANT THOUGH HAROON AL RUSHEED WAS PASSIONATE AND IN HIS HEAT SOMETIMES GUILTY OF CRUEL ACTIONS
1594-135914-0093 HAVING THEREFORE NO LONGER CAUSE TO DOUBT BUT THAT HE HAD UNJUSTLY PERSECUTED GANEM AND HIS FAMILY AND HAD PUBLICLY WRONGED THEM HE RESOLVED TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC SATISFACTION
1594-135914-0094 THAT YOUR SEARCH HAS PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL IT IS A REAL SATISFACTION TO ME NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MY OWN I WILL KEEP THE PROMISE I HAVE MADE YOU YOU SHALL MARRY GANEM AND I HERE DECLARE YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SLAVE YOU ARE FREE
1594-135914-0095 GO BACK TO THAT YOUNG MERCHANT AND AS SOON AS HE HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH YOU SHALL BRING HIM TO ME WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THE NEXT MORNING EARLY FETNAH REPAIRED TO THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS BEING IMPATIENT TO HEAR OF GANEM'S HEALTH AND TELL THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE GOOD NEWS SHE HAD FOR THEM
1594-135914-0096 WHO TOLD HER THAT GANEM HAD RESTED WELL THAT NIGHT AND THAT HIS DISORDER PROCEEDING ALTOGETHER FROM MELANCHOLY THE CAUSE BEING REMOVED HE WOULD SOON RECOVER HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0097 REST AND THE GOOD MEDICINES HE HAD TAKEN BUT ABOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SITUATION OF HIS MIND HAD WROUGHT SO GOOD AN EFFECT THAT THE SYNDIC THOUGHT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DANGER SEE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTER AND HIS MISTRESS PROVIDED HE WAS PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM
1594-135914-0098 BECAUSE THERE WAS GROUND TO FEAR THAT NOT KNOWING HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE AT BAGDAD THE SIGHT OF THEM MIGHT OCCASION TOO GREAT SURPRISE AND JOY IT WAS THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT FETNAH SHOULD FIRST GO ALONE INTO GANEM'S CHAMBER
1594-135914-0099 WHEN SHE THOUGHT IT WAS PROPER MATTERS BEING SO ORDERED THE SYNDIC ANNOUNCED FETNAH'S COMING TO THE SICK MAN WHO WAS SO TRANSPORTED TO SEE HER THAT HE WAS AGAIN NEAR FAINTING AWAY WELL GANEM SAID SHE DRAWING NEAR TO HIS BED
1594-135914-0100 YOU HAVE AGAIN FOUND YOUR FETNAH WHOM YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD LOST FOR EVER
1594-135914-0101 WHAT MIRACLE HAS RESTORED YOU TO MY SIGHT
1594-135914-0102 HE HAS DOUBTLESS LISTENED TO YOU YOU HAVE DISPELLED HIS JEALOUSY AND HE HAS RESTORED YOU TO HIS FAVOUR YES MY DEAR GANEM ANSWERED FETNAH I HAVE CLEARED MYSELF BEFORE THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WHO TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE YOU
1594-135914-0103 BEAUTIFUL FETNAH MAY I GIVE CREDIT TO WHAT YOU TELL ME
1594-135914-0104 NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN ANSWERED THE LADY
1594-135914-0105 WHO BEFORE CAUSED SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR YOU TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LIFE AND WHO IN HIS FURY CAUSED YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR SISTER TO SUFFER A THOUSAND INDIGNITIES DESIRES NOW TO SEE YOU THAT HE MAY REWARD THE RESPECT YOU HAD FOR HIM
1594-135914-0106 AND THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT HE WILL LOAD YOUR FAMILY WITH FAVOURS
1594-135914-0107 AND HE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS AT THE RELATION NOTWITHSTANDING THE THOUGHTS WHICH AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING MARRIED TO HIS MISTRESS BUT WHEN FETNAH INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN BAGDAD AND IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM
1594-135914-0108 HE APPEARED SO IMPATIENT TO SEE THEM THAT THE FAVOURITE COULD NO LONGER DEFER GIVING HIM THE SATISFACTION AND ACCORDINGLY CALLED THEM IN THEY WERE AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT THEY ENTERED WENT UP TO GANEM AND EMBRACING HIM IN THEIR TURNS
1594-135914-0109 THE SYNDIC HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MOVED AT THE SPECTACLE THAT THEY COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING NOR SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE THE SECRET WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO THEIR HOUSE FOUR PERSONS WHOM FORTUNE HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED
1594-135914-0110 WHEN THEY HAD DRIED UP THEIR TEARS GANEM DREW THEM AFRESH BY THE RECITAL OF WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM THE DAY HE LEFT FETNAH TILL THE MOMENT THE SYNDIC BROUGHT HIM TO HIS HOUSE HE TOLD THEM THAT HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A SMALL VILLAGE HE THERE FELL SICK
1594-135914-0111 THAT SOME CHARITABLE PEASANTS HAD TAKEN CARE OF HIM BUT FINDING HE DID NOT RECOVER A CAMEL DRIVER HAD UNDERTAKEN TO CARRY HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AT BAGDAD
1594-135914-0112 AND HOW SHE HAD CLEARED HERSELF IN CONCLUSION WHEN THEY HAD RELATED WHAT ACCIDENTS HAD BEFALLEN THEM FETNAH SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN WHICH HAS BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER AGAIN AND LET US THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE HAPPINESS THAT AWAITS US
1594-135914-0113 AS SOON AS GANEM HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0114 BUT I WILL GO AND MAKE SOME PROVISION FOR THEM THIS SAID SHE WENT TO THE PALACE AND SOON RETURNED WITH A PURSE CONTAINING A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD WHICH SHE DELIVERED TO THE SYNDIC DESIRING HIM TO BUY APPAREL FOR THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
1594-135914-0115 THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MAN OF A GOOD TASTE CHOSE SUCH AS WERE VERY HANDSOME AND HAD THEM MADE UP WITH ALL EXPEDITION THEY WERE FINISHED IN THREE DAYS AND GANEM FINDING HIMSELF STRONG ENOUGH PREPARED TO GO ABROAD
1594-135914-0116 WHILE HE WAS MAKING READY WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THE GRAND VIZIER JAAFFIER CAME TO THE SYNDIC'S HOUSE HE HAD COME ON HORSEBACK ATTENDED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF OFFICERS SIR SAID HE TO GANEM AS SOON AS HE ENTERED
1594-135914-0117 I AM COME FROM THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS MY MASTER AND YOURS THE ORDERS I HAVE DIFFER MUCH FROM THOSE WHICH I DO NOT WISH TO REVIVE IN YOUR MEMORY I AM TO BEAR YOU COMPANY
1594-135914-0118 GANEM RETURNED NO OTHER ANSWER TO THE VIZIER'S COMPLIMENT THAN BY PROFOUNDLY BOWING HIS HEAD
1594-135914-0119 WHICH HE MANAGED VERY GRACEFULLY THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BELONGING TO THE PALACE AND WHILST FETNAH ON ANOTHER MULE LED THEM BY A BYE WAY TO THE PRINCE'S COURT JAAFFIER CONDUCTED GANEM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE
1594-135914-0120 ARABS PERSIANS EGYPTIANS AFRICANS AND SYRIANS OF HIS OWN DOMINIONS NOT TO MENTION STRANGERS WHEN THE VIZIER HAD CONDUCTED GANEM TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE
1594-135914-0121 I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHERE YOU FOUND MY FAVOURITE AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR HER GANEM OBEYED
1594-135914-0122 AFTER WHICH HE SAID TO HIM GANEM I WILL HAVE YOU LIVE IN MY COURT COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MERCHANT A SLAVE HAS NO WILL BUT HIS MASTER'S ON WHOM HIS LIFE AND FORTUNE DEPEND
1594-135914-0123 AND ASSIGNED HIM A CONSIDERABLE PENSION HE THEN DESCENDED FROM HIS THRONE AND CAUSING ONLY GANEM AND THE GRAND VIZIER FOLLOW HIM RETIRED INTO HIS OWN APARTMENT
1594-135914-0124 NOT QUESTIONING BUT THAT FETNAH WAS IN WAITING WITH ABOU AYOUB'S WIDOW AND DAUGHTER HE CAUSED THEM TO BE CALLED IN THEY PROSTRATED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE MADE THEM RISE AND WAS SO CHARMED BY JALIB AL KOOLLOOB'S BEAUTY
1594-135914-0125 THAT AFTER VIEWING HER VERY ATTENTIVELY HE SAID I AM SO SORRY FOR HAVING TREATED YOUR CHARMS SO UNWORTHILY THAT I OWE THEM SUCH A SATISFACTION AS MAY SURPASS THE INJURY I HAVE DONE I TAKE YOU TO WIFE
1594-135914-0126 WHO SHALL BECOME THE FIRST CAUSE OF YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AS SHE WAS OF YOUR PAST SUFFERINGS THIS IS NOT ALL ADDED HE TURNING TOWARDS GANEM'S MOTHER YOU ARE STILL YOUNG I BELIEVE YOU WILL NOT DISDAIN TO BE ALLIED TO MY GRAND VIZIER
1594-135914-0127 I GIVE YOU TO JAAFFIER AND YOU FETNAH TO GANEM LET A CAUZEE AND WITNESSES BE CALLED AND THE THREE CONTRACTS BE DRAWN UP AND SIGNED IMMEDIATELY
1594-135914-0128 BUT HE WAS RESOLVED TO MARRY HER HAROON THOUGHT THIS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY THAT HE ORDERED HIS HISTORIOGRAPHER TO COMMIT IT TO WRITING WITH ALL ITS CIRCUMSTANCES
3699-19401-0000 MY FATHER HAD SUCH A SKIRMISHING CUTTING KIND OF A SLASHING WAY WITH HIM IN HIS DISPUTATIONS THRUSTING AND RIPPING AND GIVING EVERY ONE A STROKE TO REMEMBER HIM BY IN HIS TURN
3699-19401-0001 FOR THAT THE TAYLOR IN RIPPING THEM UP IN ORDER TO TURN THEM HAD FOUND THEY HAD BEEN TURN'D BEFORE THEN TURN THEM AGAIN BROTHER SAID MY FATHER RAPIDLY FOR THERE WILL BE MANY A TURNING OF EM YET BEFORE ALL'S DONE IN THE AFFAIR
3699-19401-0002 THEY ARE AS ROTTEN AS DIRT SAID THE CORPORAL THEN BY ALL MEANS SAID MY FATHER BESPEAK A NEW PAIR BROTHER FOR THOUGH I KNOW CONTINUED MY FATHER TURNING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY
3699-19401-0003 THAT WIDOW WADMAN HAS BEEN DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH MY BROTHER TOBY FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS USED EVERY ART AND CIRCUMVENTION OF WOMAN TO OUTWIT HIM INTO THE SAME PASSION YET NOW THAT SHE HAS CAUGHT HIM HER FEVER WILL BE PASS'D ITS HEIGHT
3699-19401-0004 INTO A CORPS NO MATTER WHETHER HE LOVES THE SERVICE OR NO BEING ONCE IN IT HE ACTS AS IF HE DID AND TAKES EVERY STEP TO SHEW HIMSELF A MAN OF PROWESSE
3699-19401-0005 THE HYPOTHESIS LIKE THE REST OF MY FATHER'S WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD BUT A SINGLE WORD TO OBJECT TO IT IN WHICH TRIM STOOD READY TO SECOND HIM BUT MY FATHER HAD NOT DRAWN HIS CONCLUSION
3699-19401-0006 FOR THIS REASON CONTINUED MY FATHER STATING THE CASE OVER AGAIN NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE WORLD KNOWS THAT MISSUS WADMAN AFFECTS MY BROTHER TOBY AND MY BROTHER TOBY CONTRARIWISE AFFECTS MISSUS WADMAN
3699-19401-0007 AND NO OBSTACLE IN NATURE TO FORBID THE MUSIC STRIKING UP THIS VERY NIGHT YET WILL I ANSWER FOR IT THAT THIS SELF SAME TUNE WILL NOT BE PLAY'D THIS TWELVEMONTH
3699-19401-0008 WE HAVE TAKEN OUR MEASURES BADLY QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING UP INTERROGATIVELY IN TRIM'S FACE I WOULD LAY MY MONTERO CAP SAID TRIM
3699-19401-0009 NOW TRIM'S MONTERO CAP AS I ONCE TOLD YOU WAS HIS CONSTANT WAGER AND HAVING FURBISH'D IT UP THAT VERY NIGHT IN ORDER TO GO UPON THE ATTACK IT MADE THE ODDS LOOK MORE CONSIDERABLE
3699-19401-0010 I WOULD LAY AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR MY MONTERO CAP TO A SHILLING WAS IT PROPER CONTINUED TRIM MAKING A BOW TO OFFER A WAGER BEFORE YOUR HONOURS THERE IS NOTHING IMPROPER IN IT SAID MY FATHER
3699-19401-0011 THAT WIDOW WADMAN AN PLEASE YOUR WORSHIP CANNOT HOLD IT OUT TEN DAYS AND WHENCE CRIED SLOP JEERINGLY HAST THOU ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE OF WOMAN FRIEND
3699-19401-0012 BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A POPISH CLERGY WOMAN SAID TRIM TWAS A BEGUINE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY DOCTOR SLOP WAS TOO MUCH IN WRATH TO LISTEN TO THE DISTINCTION
3699-19401-0013 AND MY FATHER TAKING THAT VERY CRISIS TO FALL IN HELTER SKELTER UPON THE WHOLE ORDER OF NUNS AND BEGUINES A SET OF SILLY FUSTY BAGGAGES SLOP COULD NOT STAND IT AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAVING SOME MEASURES TO TAKE ABOUT HIS BREECHES
3699-19401-0014 AND PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL FOR THEE THO NOT SO WELL FOR ME THAT THOU HAST OCCASION FOR A LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS UPON THAT HEAD AND THAT I AM ABLE TO WRITE IT TO THEE HAD IT BEEN THE GOOD PLEASURE OF HIM WHO DISPOSES OF OUR LOTS
3699-19401-0015 MISSUS SHANDY BEING NOW CLOSE BESIDE ME PREPARING FOR BED I HAVE THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT ORDER AND JUST AS THEY HAVE COME INTO MY MIND SUCH HINTS AND DOCUMENTS AS I DEEM MAY BE OF USE TO THEE
3699-19401-0016 THOUGH I PERCEIVE FROM A GLOW IN MY CHEEK THAT I BLUSH AS I BEGIN TO SPEAK TO THEE UPON THE SUBJECT AS WELL KNOWING NOTWITHSTANDING THY UNAFFECTED SECRECY HOW FEW OF ITS OFFICES THOU NEGLECTEST
3699-19401-0017 YET I WOULD REMIND THEE OF ONE DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THY COURTSHIP IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE OMITTED AND THAT IS NEVER TO GO FORTH UPON THE ENTERPRIZE WHETHER IT BE IN THE MORNING OR THE AFTERNOON
3699-19401-0018 WITHOUT FIRST RECOMMENDING THYSELF TO THE PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HE MAY DEFEND THEE FROM THE EVIL ONE SHAVE THE WHOLE TOP OF THY CROWN CLEAN
3699-19401-0019 ONCE AT LEAST EVERY FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BUT OFTNER IF CONVENIENT LEST IN TAKING OFF THY WIG BEFORE HER THRO ABSENCE OF MIND SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISCOVER HOW MUCH HAS BEEN CUT AWAY BY TIME HOW MUCH BY TRIM
3699-19401-0020 WHATEVER THOU HAST TO SAY BE IT MORE OR LESS FORGET NOT TO UTTER IT IN A LOW SOFT TONE OF VOICE SILENCE AND WHATEVER APPROACHES IT WEAVES DREAMS OF MIDNIGHT SECRECY INTO THE BRAIN
3699-19401-0021 FOR THIS CAUSE IF THOU CANST HELP IT NEVER THROW DOWN THE TONGS AND POKER AVOID ALL KINDS OF PLEASANTRY AND FACETIOUSNESS IN THY DISCOURSE WITH HER
3699-19401-0022 THEY ARE ALL BOOKS WHICH EXCITE LAUGHTER AND THOU KNOWEST DEAR TOBY THAT THERE IS NO PASSION SO SERIOUS AS LUST STICK A PIN IN THE BOSOM OF THY SHIRT BEFORE THOU ENTEREST HER PARLOUR
3699-19401-0023 THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
3699-19401-0024 WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
3699-19401-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH SHOULD PUT IT OFF BEYOND THE NEXT MORNING SO ACCORDINGLY IT WAS RESOLV'D UPON FOR ELEVEN O'CLOCK
3699-19401-0026 BUT THE ACCOUNT OF THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN TO BE WOVE INTO THE FAG END OF THE EIGHTH ALLUDING TO THE FIRST EDITION VOLUME OF SUCH A WORK AS THIS
3699-47246-0000 CHAPTER FOUR I AM BY NO MEANS SURE THAT IF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF MILBY HAD KNOWN THE TRUTH ABOUT THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING AS BAD AS THEY IMAGINED
3699-47246-0001 NICE DISTINCTIONS ARE TROUBLESOME IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO SAY THAT A THING IS BLACK THAN TO DISCRIMINATE THE PARTICULAR SHADE OF BROWN BLUE OR GREEN TO WHICH IT REALLY BELONGS
3699-47246-0002 BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
3699-47246-0003 AND WHICH WOULD BE UTTERLY OVERTURNED AND NULLIFIED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT PREMISS MISSUS PHIPPS THE BANKER'S WIFE AND MISSUS LANDOR THE ATTORNEY'S WIFE HAD INVESTED PART OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR ACUTENESS
3699-47246-0004 HAD NO COMPENSATING SUPERIORITY IN VIRTUE TO SET AGAINST THE OTHER LADY'S MANIFEST SUPERIORITY IN PERSONAL CHARMS MISS PHIPPS'S STUMPY FIGURE AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTIRE
3699-47246-0005 INSTEAD OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A MOUNT OF VIRTUE WITH AN AUREOLE ROUND ITS HEAD WOULD THEN BE SEEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AND IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI'S DIANA LIKE FORM AND WELL CHOSEN DRAPERY
3699-47246-0006 MISS PHIPPS FOR HER PART DIDN'T LIKE DRESSING FOR EFFECT SHE HAD ALWAYS AVOIDED THAT STYLE OF APPEARANCE WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO CREATE A SENSATION
3699-47246-0007 THEN WHAT AMUSING INNUENDOES OF THE MILBY GENTLEMEN OVER THEIR WINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FRUSTRATED AND REDUCED TO NOUGHT IF YOU HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE COUNTESS HAD REALLY BEEN GUILTY OF NO MISDEMEANOURS WHICH DEMANDED HER EXCLUSION FROM STRICTLY RESPECTABLE SOCIETY
3699-47246-0008 HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
3699-47246-0009 HAD WON A PARTNERSHIP IN A SILK MANUFACTORY AND THEREBY A MODERATE FORTUNE THAT ENABLED HIM TO RETIRE AS YOU SEE TO STUDY POLITICS THE WEATHER AND THE ART OF CONVERSATION AT HIS LEISURE
3699-47246-0010 MISTER BRIDMAIN IN FACT QUADRAGENARIAN BACHELOR AS HE WAS FELT EXTREMELY WELL PLEASED TO RECEIVE HIS SISTER IN HER WIDOWHOOD AND TO SHINE IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF HER BEAUTY AND TITLE
3699-47246-0011 EVERY MAN WHO IS NOT A MONSTER A MATHEMATICIAN OR A MAD PHILOSOPHER IS THE SLAVE OF SOME WOMAN OR OTHER MISTER BRIDMAIN HAD PUT HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF HIS HANDSOME SISTER AND THOUGH HIS SOUL WAS A VERY LITTLE ONE
3699-47246-0012 OF THE SMALLEST DESCRIPTION INDEED HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED TO CALL IT HIS OWN HE MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY RECALCITRANT NOW AND THEN AS IS THE HABIT OF LONG EARED PACHYDERMS UNDER THE THONG OF THE FAIR COUNTESS'S TONGUE
3699-47246-0013 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN'S FIRST NUPTIALS MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE THE COUNTESS WAS QUITE SURE OF HER SECOND AS IT WAS HOWEVER HE SUBMITTED TO ALL HIS SISTER'S CAPRICES
3699-47246-0014 AS PERSONAGES ON THE DEBATABLE GROUND BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND COMMONALTY INSTEAD OF SETTLING IN SOME SPOT WHERE HIS FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MIGHT HAVE WON HIM THE DEFINITE DIGNITY OF A PAROCHIAL MAGNATE
3699-47246-0015 WHOM HE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE PAS DE BAS AND THE LANCERS QUADRILLES SHE HAD HAD SEVEN YEARS OF SUFFICIENTLY HAPPY MATRIMONY WITH CZERLASKI WHO HAD TAKEN HER TO PARIS AND GERMANY
3699-47246-0016 NOT INDEED ANY VERY RIPE AND COMPREHENSIVE WISDOM BUT MUCH EXTERNAL POLISH AND CERTAIN PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY DECIDED KIND
3699-47246-0017 ONE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THERE WERE THINGS MORE SOLID IN LIFE THAN FINE WHISKERS AND A TITLE AND THAT IN ACCEPTING A SECOND HUSBAND
3699-47246-0018 WAS DIFFICULT TO BE MET WITH AT WATERING PLACES WHICH WERE ALREADY PREOCCUPIED WITH ABUNDANCE OF ANGLING BEAUTIES AND WERE CHIEFLY STOCKED WITH MEN WHOSE WHISKERS MIGHT BE DYED AND WHOSE INCOMES WERE STILL MORE PROBLEMATIC
3699-47246-0019 SO SHE HAD DETERMINED ON TRYING A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S AFFAIRS AND WHERE THE WOMEN WERE MOSTLY ILL DRESSED AND UGLY
3699-47246-0020 AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A SORT OF COUSINSHIP TO THE QUARTER SESSIONS ALL THIS WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE TRUTH WOULD HAVE SEEMED EXTREMELY FLAT TO THE GOSSIPS OF MILBY WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXCITING
3699-47246-0021 THERE WAS NOTHING HERE SO VERY DETESTABLE IT IS TRUE THE COUNTESS WAS A LITTLE VAIN A LITTLE AMBITIOUS A LITTLE SELFISH A LITTLE SHALLOW AND FRIVOLOUS A LITTLE GIVEN TO WHITE LIES BUT
3699-47246-0022 WHO CONSIDERS SUCH SLIGHT BLEMISHES SUCH MORAL PIMPLES AS THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR ENTERING INTO THE MOST RESPECTABLE SOCIETY INDEED
3699-47246-0023 THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
3699-47246-0024 WHY IT MUST LIE IN THE POSSESSION OF SOME VICES FROM WHICH THEY WERE UNDENIABLY FREE HENCE IT CAME TO PASS THAT MILBY RESPECTABILITY REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI
3699-47246-0025 IN SPITE OF HER ASSIDUOUS CHURCH GOING AND THE DEEP DISGUST SHE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED AT THE EXTREME PAUCITY OF THE CONGREGATIONS ON ASH WEDNESDAYS
3699-47246-0026 SO SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD MISCALCULATED THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
3699-47246-0027 AND SHUNS A COLDLY SATIRICAL EYE AS SHE WOULD SHUN A GORGON AND SHE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER FOR CLERICAL NOTICE AND FRIENDSHIP NOT MERELY BECAUSE THAT IS QUITE THE MOST RESPECTABLE COUNTENANCE TO BE OBTAINED IN SOCIETY
3699-47246-0028 AND HAD AN UNEASY SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SAFE IN THAT QUARTER SHE HAD SERIOUS INTENTIONS OF BECOMING QUITE PIOUS WITHOUT ANY RESERVES WHEN SHE HAD ONCE GOT HER CARRIAGE AND SETTLEMENT
3699-47246-0029 THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
3699-47246-0030 FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS ONE BEING TO WHOM THE COUNTESS WAS ABSORBINGLY DEVOTED AND TO WHOSE DESIRES SHE MADE EVERYTHING ELSE SUBSERVIENT NAMELY CAROLINE CZERLASKI NEE BRIDMAIN
3699-47246-0031 THUS THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH AFFECTATION IN HER SWEET SPEECHES AND ATTENTIONS TO MISTER AND MISSUS BARTON
3699-47246-0032 STILL THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY NO MEANS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE OBJECT SHE HAD IN VIEW WHEN SHE CAME TO MILBY AND IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME CLEAR TO HER THAT SHE MUST SUGGEST A NEW CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO HER BROTHER
3699-19402-0000 COULD HAVE VENTED SUCH AN INSINUATION HE WAS HOWEVER FRANK AND GENEROUS IN HIS NATURE AND AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO CONVICTION SO THAT HE HAD SCARCE GOT TO THE LAST WORD OF THIS UNGRACIOUS RETORT
3699-19402-0001 WHEN HIS CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM MY MOTHER WAS THEN CONJUGALLY SWINGING WITH HER LEFT ARM TWISTED UNDER HIS RIGHT IN SUCH WISE THAT THE INSIDE OF HER HAND RESTED UPON THE BACK OF HIS
3699-19402-0002 SHE RAISED HER FINGERS AND LET THEM FALL IT COULD SCARCE BE CALL'D A TAP OR IF IT WAS A TAP
3699-19402-0003 WHETHER TWAS A TAP OF REMONSTRANCE OR A TAP OF CONFESSION MY FATHER WHO WAS ALL SENSIBILITIES FROM HEAD TO FOOT
3699-19402-0004 CONSCIENCE REDOUBLED HER BLOW HE TURN'D HIS FACE SUDDENLY THE OTHER WAY AND MY MOTHER SUPPOSING HIS BODY WAS ABOUT TO TURN WITH IT IN ORDER TO MOVE HOMEWARDS BY A CROSS MOVEMENT OF HER RIGHT LEG
3699-19402-0005 A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
3699-19402-0006 MY MOTHER MADAM WAS SO AT NO TIME EITHER BY NATURE BY INSTITUTION OR EXAMPLE A TEMPERATE CURRENT OF BLOOD RAN ORDERLY THROUGH HER VEINS IN ALL MONTHS OF THE YEAR
3699-19402-0007 WHICH HAVING LITTLE OR NO MEANING IN THEM NATURE IS OFT TIMES OBLIGED TO FIND ONE AND AS FOR MY FATHER'S EXAMPLE TWAS SO FAR FROM BEING EITHER AIDING OR ABETTING THEREUNTO
3699-19402-0008 THAT TWAS THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO KEEP ALL FANCIES OF THAT KIND OUT OF HER HEAD NATURE HAD DONE HER PART TO HAVE SPARED HIM THIS TROUBLE AND WHAT WAS NOT A LITTLE INCONSISTENT MY FATHER KNEW IT
3699-19402-0009 AND HERE AM I SITTING THIS TWELFTH DAY OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX IN A PURPLE JERKIN AND YELLOW PAIR OF SLIPPERS WITHOUT EITHER WIG OR CAP ON A MOST TRAGICOMICAL COMPLETION OF HIS PREDICTION
3699-19402-0010 FOR CERTAINLY KEY HOLES WERE MADE FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND CONSIDERING THE ACT AS AN ACT WHICH INTERFERED WITH A TRUE PROPOSITION AND DENIED A KEY HOLE TO BE WHAT IT WAS
3699-19402-0011 IT BECAME A VIOLATION OF NATURE AND WAS SO FAR YOU SEE CRIMINAL IT IS FOR THIS REASON AN PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES THAT KEY HOLES ARE THE OCCASIONS OF MORE SIN AND WICKEDNESS THAN ALL OTHER HOLES
3699-19402-0012 THOUGH THE CORPORAL HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS HIS WORD IN PUTTING MY UNCLE TOBY'S GREAT RAMALLIE WIG INTO PIPES YET THE TIME WAS TOO SHORT TO PRODUCE ANY GREAT EFFECTS FROM IT IT HAD LAIN MANY YEARS SQUEEZED UP IN THE CORNER OF HIS OLD CAMPAIGN TRUNK
3699-19402-0013 TWOULD HAVE COST HER LADYSHIP A SMILE IT CURL'D EVERY WHERE BUT WHERE THE CORPORAL WOULD HAVE IT AND WHERE A BUCKLE OR TWO IN HIS OPINION WOULD HAVE DONE IT HONOUR HE COULD AS SOON HAVE RAISED THE DEAD
3699-19402-0014 SUCH IT WAS OR RATHER SUCH WOULD IT HAVE SEEM'D UPON ANY OTHER BROW BUT THE SWEET LOOK OF GOODNESS WHICH SAT UPON MY UNCLE TOBY'S ASSIMILATED EVERY THING AROUND IT SO SOVEREIGNLY TO ITSELF
3699-19402-0015 AND NATURE HAD MOREOVER WROTE GENTLEMAN WITH SO FAIR A HAND IN EVERY LINE OF HIS COUNTENANCE THAT EVEN HIS TARNISH'D GOLD LACED HAT AND HUGE COCKADE OF FLIMSY TAFFETA BECAME HIM
3699-19402-0016 IN A PERIOD OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A TOTAL INACTIVITY IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S LIFE FOR HE SELDOM WENT FURTHER THAN THE BOWLING GREEN
3699-19402-0017 AND TO SHORTEN ALL DESCRIPTION THEY SHONE SO BRIGHT AGAINST THE SUN THAT MORNING AND HAD SO METALLICK AND DOUGHTY AN AIR WITH THEM THAT HAD MY UNCLE TOBY THOUGHT OF ATTACKING IN ARMOUR NOTHING COULD HAVE SO WELL IMPOSED UPON HIS IMAGINATION
3699-19402-0018 AND WITH HIS HAIR TUCK'D UP UNDER HIS MONTERO CAP WHICH HE HAD FURBISH'D UP FOR THE OCCASION
3699-19402-0019 A WHIFF OF MILITARY PRIDE HAD PUFF'D OUT HIS SHIRT AT THE WRIST AND UPON THAT IN A BLACK LEATHER THONG CLIPP'D INTO A TASSEL BEYOND THE KNOT HUNG THE CORPORAL'S STICK MY UNCLE TOBY CARRIED HIS CANE
3699-19402-0020 LIKE A PIKE IT LOOKS WELL AT LEAST QUOTH MY FATHER TO HIMSELF
3699-19402-0021 MY UNCLE TOBY TURN'D HIS HEAD MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND HIM TO SEE HOW HE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CORPORAL AND THE CORPORAL AS OFT AS HE DID IT GAVE A SLIGHT FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK
3699-19402-0022 BUT NOT VAPOURINGLY AND WITH THE SWEETEST ACCENT OF MOST RESPECTFUL ENCOURAGEMENT BID HIS HONOUR NEVER FEAR NOW MY UNCLE TOBY DID FEAR AND GRIEVOUSLY TOO
3699-19402-0023 INFINITE WAS HIS PITY NOR WOULD THE MOST COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF ROMANCE HAVE GONE FURTHER AT LEAST UPON ONE LEG TO HAVE WIPED AWAY A TEAR FROM A WOMAN'S EYE
3699-19402-0024 AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART
3699-19402-0025 SHE CANNOT QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY HALTING WHEN THEY HAD MARCH'D UP TO WITHIN TWENTY PACES OF MISSUS WADMAN'S DOOR SHE CANNOT CORPORAL TAKE IT AMISS
3699-19402-0026 YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL KNOWS OF TOM'S MISFORTUNES BUT THIS AFFAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ANY FURTHER THAN THIS
3699-19402-0027 THAT IF TOM HAD NOT MARRIED THE WIDOW OR HAD IT PLEASED GOD AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THAT THEY HAD BUT PUT PORK INTO THEIR SAUSAGES THE HONEST SOUL HAD NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS WARM BED AND DRAGG'D TO THE INQUISITION
3699-19402-0028 WHEN ONCE A POOR CREATURE IS IN HE IS IN AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR FOR EVER TIS VERY TRUE SAID MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING GRAVELY AT MISSUS WADMAN'S HOUSE AS HE SPOKE NOTHING
3699-19402-0029 SAID MY UNCLE TOBY MUSING WHILST A MAN IS FREE CRIED THE CORPORAL GIVING A FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK THUS
3699-19402-0030 A THOUSAND OF MY FATHER'S MOST SUBTLE SYLLOGISMS COULD NOT HAVE SAID MORE FOR CELIBACY MY UNCLE TOBY LOOK'D EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE AND HIS BOWLING GREEN
7780-274562-0000 THE AZURE FIELDS OF HEAVEN WERE SEMBLED RIGHT IN A LARGE ROUND SET WITH FLOW'RS OF LIGHT THE FLOWERS DE LUCE AND THE ROUND SPARKS OF DEW THAT HUNG UPON THEIR AZURE LEAVES DID SHOW LIKE TWINKLING STARS THAT SPARKLE IN THE EV'NING BLUE
7780-274562-0001 GILES FLETCHER NO MORE REMARKABLE MAN EVER LIVED THAN MY FRIEND THE YOUNG ELLISON HE WAS REMARKABLE IN THE ENTIRE AND CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS EVER LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE
7780-274562-0002 FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE A GALE OF THE BLANDEST PROSPERITY BORE HIM ALONG NOR DO I USE THE WORD PROSPERITY IN ITS MERE WORDLY OR EXTERNAL SENSE I MEAN IT AS SYNONYMOUS WITH HAPPINESS
7780-274562-0003 THE PERSON OF WHOM I SPEAK SEEMED BORN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORESHADOWING THE WILD DOCTRINES OF TURGOT PRICE PRIESTLEY AND CONDORCET OF EXEMPLIFYING BY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCE
7780-274562-0004 WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
7780-274562-0005 THE ANTAGONIST OF BLISS AN INTIMATE AND ANXIOUS EXAMINATION OF HIS CAREER HAS TAUGHT ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN GENERAL FROM THE VIOLATION OF A FEW SIMPLE LAWS OF HUMANITY ARISES THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MANKIND
7780-274562-0006 THAT AS A SPECIES WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION THE AS YET UNWROUGHT ELEMENTS OF CONTENT AND THAT EVEN NOW IN THE PRESENT BLINDNESS AND DARKNESS OF ALL IDEA ON THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE SOCIAL CONDITION
7780-274562-0007 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT MAN THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER CERTAIN UNUSUAL AND HIGHLY FORTUITOUS CONDITIONS MAY BE HAPPY WITH OPINIONS SUCH AS THESE WAS MY YOUNG FRIEND FULLY IMBUED
7780-274562-0008 AND THUS IS IT ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAT THE UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS LIFE WAS IN GREAT PART THE RESULT OF PRECONCERT IT IS INDEED EVIDENT
7780-274562-0009 EXPERIENCE MISTER ELLISON WOULD HAVE FOUND HIMSELF PRECIPITATED BY THE VERY EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES OF HIS LIFE INTO THE COMMON VORTEX OF UNHAPPINESS WHICH YAWNS FOR THOSE OF PREEMINENT ENDOWMENTS
7780-274562-0010 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS MY PRESENT OBJECT TO PEN AN ESSAY ON HAPPINESS THE IDEAS OF MY FRIEND MAY BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WORDS HE ADMITTED BUT FOUR UNVARYING LAWS
7780-274562-0011 OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
7780-274562-0012 ATTAINABLE BY OTHER MEANS THAN THIS IS SCARCELY WORTH THE NAME HE POINTED TO THE TILLERS OF THE EARTH THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO AS A CLASS ARE PROVERBIALLY MORE HAPPY THAN OTHERS
7780-274562-0013 AND THEN HE INSTANCED THE HIGH ECSTASIES OF THE FOX HUNTER HIS SECOND PRINCIPLE WAS THE LOVE OF WOMAN
7780-274562-0014 HIS FOURTH WAS AN OBJECT OF UNCEASING PURSUIT AND HE HELD THAT OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE EXTENT OF HAPPINESS WAS PROPORTIONED TO THE SPIRITUALITY OF THIS OBJECT
7780-274562-0015 I HAVE SAID THAT ELLISON WAS REMARKABLE IN THE CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE IN PERSONAL GRACE AND BEAUTY HE EXCEEDED ALL MEN
7780-274562-0016 HIS INTELLECT WAS OF THAT ORDER TO WHICH THE ATTAINMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IS LESS A LABOR THAN A NECESSITY AND AN INTUITION HIS FAMILY WAS ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS OF THE EMPIRE HIS BRIDE WAS THE LOVELIEST AND MOST DEVOTED OF WOMEN
7780-274562-0017 HIS POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN ALWAYS AMPLE BUT UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ONE AND TWENTIETH YEAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY FREAKS OF FATE HAD BEEN PLAYED IN HIS BEHALF WHICH STARTLE THE WHOLE SOCIAL WORLD AMID WHICH THEY OCCUR
7780-274562-0018 AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
7780-274562-0019 ELLISON THIS GENTLEMEN HAD AMASSED A PRINCELY FORTUNE AND HAVING NO VERY IMMEDIATE CONNEXIONS CONCEIVED THE WHIM OF SUFFERING HIS WEALTH TO ACCUMULATE FOR A CENTURY AFTER HIS DECEASE
7780-274562-0020 MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
7780-274562-0021 MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO SET ASIDE THIS SINGULAR BEQUEST THEIR EX POST FACTO CHARACTER RENDERED THEM ABORTIVE
7780-274562-0022 A DECREE FINALLY OBTAINED FORBIDDING ALL SIMILAR ACCUMULATIONS THIS ACT DID NOT PREVENT YOUNG ELLISON UPON HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTH DAY
7780-274562-0023 FROM ENTERING INTO POSSESSION AS THE HEIR OF HIS ANCESTOR SEABRIGHT OF A FORTUNE OF
7780-274562-0024 THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY SPECULATIONS AS TO THE MODE OF ITS DISPOSAL THE GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE AND THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE NATURE OF THE SUM DAZZLED AND BEWILDERED ALL WHO THOUGHT UPON THE TOPIC
7780-274562-0025 THE POSSESSOR OF ANY APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMAGINED TO PERFORM ANY ONE OF A THOUSAND THINGS WITH RICHES MERELY SURPASSING THOSE OF ANY CITIZEN
7780-274562-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
7780-274562-0027 OR DEVISING GORGEOUS ARCHITECTURAL PILES OR COLLECTING LARGE SPECIMENS OF VIRTU OR PLAYING THE MUNIFICENT PATRON OF LETTERS AND ART OR ENDOWING AND BESTOWING HIS NAME UPON EXTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS OF CHARITY
7780-274562-0028 BUT FOR THE INCONCEIVABLE WEALTH IN THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE YOUNG HEIR THESE OBJECTS AND ALL ORDINARY OBJECTS WERE FELT TO BE INADEQUATE RECOURSE WAS HAD TO FIGURES
7780-274562-0029 AND FIGURES BUT SUFFICED TO CONFOUND IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN AT THREE PER CENT THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE INHERITANCE AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN MILLIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
7780-274562-0030 WHICH WAS ONE MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH OR THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX PER DAY OR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE PER HOUR OR
7780-274562-0031 SIX AND TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT FLEW THUS THE USUAL TRACK OF SUPPOSITION WAS THOROUGHLY BROKEN UP MEN KNEW NOT WHAT TO IMAGINE
7780-274562-0032 ENRICHING WHOLE TROOPS OF HIS RELATIVES BY DIVISION OF HIS SUPERABUNDANCE I WAS NOT SURPRISED HOWEVER
7780-274562-0033 NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
7780-274562-0034 THE SUPREME MAJESTY AND DIGNITY OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT THE PROPER GRATIFICATION OF THE SENTIMENT HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT TO LIE IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL FORMS OF BEAUTY SOME PECULIARITIES EITHER IN HIS EARLY EDUCATION
7780-274562-0035 OR IN THE NATURE OF HIS INTELLECT
7780-274562-0036 AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0037 WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL MOODS OF PURELY PHYSICAL LOVELINESS THUS IT HAPPENED THAT HE BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET IF WE USE THIS LATTER TERM IN ITS EVERY DAY ACCEPTATION
7780-274562-0038 OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE BECAME NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER IN PURSUANCE OF AN IDEA OF HIS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION LAY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF HAPPINESS ON EARTH
7780-274562-0039 IS IT NOT INDEED POSSIBLE THAT WHILE A HIGH ORDER OF GENIUS IS NECESSARILY AMBITIOUS THE HIGHEST IS INVARIABLY ABOVE THAT WHICH IS TERMED AMBITION
7780-274562-0040 AND MAY IT NOT THUS HAPPEN THAT MANY FAR GREATER THAN MILTON HAVE CONTENTEDLY REMAINED MUTE AND INGLORIOUS I BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS NEVER YET SEEN AND THAT
7780-274562-0041 UNLESS THROUGH SOME SERIES OF ACCIDENTS GOADING THE NOBLEST ORDER OF MIND INTO DISTASTEFUL EXERTION THE WORLD WILL NEVER BEHOLD THAT FULL EXTENT OF TRIUMPHANT EXECUTION IN THE RICHER PRODUCTIONS OF ART
7780-274562-0042 OF WHICH THE HUMAN NATURE IS ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE MISTER ELLISON BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET ALTHOUGH NO MAN LIVED MORE PROFOUNDLY ENAMORED BOTH OF MUSIC AND THE MUSE
7780-274562-0043 UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THOSE WHICH INVESTED HIM IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BECOME A PAINTER THE FIELD OF SCULPTURE ALTHOUGH IN ITS NATURE RIGIDLY POETICAL
7780-274562-0044 WAS TOO LIMITED IN ITS EXTENT AND IN ITS CONSEQUENCES TO HAVE OCCUPIED AT ANY TIME MUCH OF HIS ATTENTION AND I HAVE NOW MENTIONED ALL THE PROVINCES IN WHICH
7780-274562-0045 EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT HAS DECLARED THIS SENTIMENT CAPABLE OF EXPATIATING I MEAN THE MOST LIBERAL PUBLIC OR RECOGNIZED CONCEPTION OF THE IDEA INVOLVED IN THE PHRASE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0046 NO DEFINITION HAD SPOKEN OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER AS OF THE POET YET MY FRIEND COULD NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE CREATION OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN OFFERED TO THE TRUE MUSE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF OPPORTUNITIES
7780-274562-0047 HERE WAS INDEED THE FAIREST FIELD FOR THE DISPLAY OF INVENTION OR IMAGINATION IN THE ENDLESS COMBINING OF FORMS OF NOVEL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0048 THE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD ENTER INTO COMBINATION BEING AT ALL TIMES AND BY A VAST SUPERIORITY THE MOST GLORIOUS WHICH THE EARTH COULD AFFORD IN THE MULTIFORM OF THE TREE
7780-274562-0049 AND IN THE MULTICOLOR OF THE FLOWER HE RECOGNIZED THE MOST DIRECT AND THE MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS OF NATURE AT PHYSICAL LOVELINESS AND IN THE DIRECTION OR CONCENTRATION OF THIS EFFORT OR
7780-274562-0050 HE PERCEIVED THAT HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYING THE BEST MEANS LABORING TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESTINY AS POET
7780-274562-0051 ITS ADAPTATION TO THE EYES WHICH WERE TO BEHOLD IT UPON EARTH IN HIS EXPLANATION OF THIS PHRASEOLOGY MISTER ELLISON DID MUCH TOWARDS SOLVING WHAT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME AN ENIGMA I MEAN THE FACT
7780-274562-0052 WHICH NONE BUT THE IGNORANT DISPUTE THAT NO SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SCENERY EXIST IN NATURE AS THE PAINTER OF GENIUS HAS IN HIS POWER TO PRODUCE
7780-274562-0053 WHILE THE COMPONENT PARTS MAY EXCEED INDIVIDUALLY THE HIGHEST SKILL OF THE ARTIST THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WILL ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT NO POSITION CAN BE ATTAINED
7780-274562-0054 FROM WHICH AN ARTISTICAL EYE LOOKING STEADILY WILL NOT FIND MATTER OF OFFENCE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE COMPOSITION OF A NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND YET HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE IS THIS
7780-274562-0055 IN ALL OTHER MATTERS WE ARE JUSTLY INSTRUCTED TO REGARD NATURE AS SUPREME WITH HER DETAILS WE SHRINK FROM COMPETITION WHO SHALL PRESUME TO IMITATE THE COLORS OF THE TULIP OR TO IMPROVE THE PROPORTIONS OF THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
7780-274562-0056 THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
7780-274562-0057 OF HUMAN LOVELINESS DO MORE THAN APPROACH THE LIVING AND BREATHING HUMAN BEAUTY AS IT GLADDENS OUR DAILY PATH BYRON WHO OFTEN ERRED ERRED NOT IN SAYING I'VE SEEN MORE LIVING BEAUTY
7780-274562-0058 RIPE AND REAL THAN ALL THE NONSENSE OF THEIR STONE IDEAL IN LANDSCAPE ALONE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CRITIC TRUE AND HAVING FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0059 IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0060 FOR THE FEELING IS NO AFFECTATION OR CHIMERA THE MATHEMATICS AFFORD NO MORE ABSOLUTE DEMONSTRATIONS THAN THE SENTIMENT OF HIS ART YIELDS TO THE ARTIST HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES
7780-274562-0061 BUT POSITIVELY KNOWS THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENTLY ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENTS OF MATTER OR FORM CONSTITUTE AND ALONE CONSTITUTE THE TRUE BEAUTY
7780-274562-0062 YET HIS REASONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MATURED INTO EXPRESSION IT REMAINS FOR A MORE PROFOUND ANALYSIS THAN THE WORLD HAS YET SEEN FULLY TO INVESTIGATE AND EXPRESS THEM
7780-274562-0063 IN HIS INSTINCTIVE OPINIONS BY THE CONCURRENCE OF ALL HIS COMPEERS LET A COMPOSITION BE DEFECTIVE LET AN EMENDATION BE WROUGHT IN ITS MERE ARRANGEMENT OF FORM
7780-274562-0064 LET THIS EMENDATION BE SUBMITTED TO EVERY ARTIST IN THE WORLD BY EACH WILL ITS NECESSITY BE ADMITTED AND EVEN FAR MORE THAN THIS IN REMEDY OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPOSITION
7780-274562-0065 EACH INSULATED MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY WILL SUGGEST THE IDENTICAL EMENDATION I REPEAT THAT IN LANDSCAPE ARRANGEMENTS OR COLLOCATIONS ALONE IS THE PHYSICAL NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXALTATION AND THAT
7780-274562-0066 THEREFORE HER SUSCEPTIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENT
7780-274562-0067 IT WAS MISTER ELLISON WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT WHAT WE REGARDED AS IMPROVEMENT OR EXALTATION OF THE NATURAL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0068 THAT EACH ALTERATION OR DISTURBANCE OF THE PRIMITIVE SCENERY MIGHT POSSIBLY EFFECT A BLEMISH IN THE PICTURE IF WE COULD SUPPOSE THIS PICTURE VIEWED AT LARGE FROM SOME REMOTE POINT IN THE HEAVENS
7780-274562-0069 IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD SAYS MISTER ELLISON THAT WHAT MIGHT IMPROVE A CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED DETAIL MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME INJURE A GENERAL AND MORE DISTANTLY OBSERVED EFFECT
7780-274562-0070 HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
7780-274562-0071 OR OF THE COLLATERAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH IT MIGHT SERVE TO CORROBORATE OR SUSTAIN THERE MIGHT BE A CLASS OF BEINGS HUMAN ONCE BUT NOW TO HUMANITY INVISIBLE
7780-274562-0072 FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
7780-274562-0073 TO HAVE WELL TREATED THIS THEME THERE ARE PROPERLY HE WRITES BUT TWO STYLES OF LANDSCAPE GARDENING THE NATURAL AND THE ARTIFICIAL
7780-274562-0074 ONE SEEKS TO RECALL THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY BY ADAPTING ITS MEANS TO THE SURROUNDING SCENERY CULTIVATING TREES IN HARMONY WITH THE HILLS OR PLAIN OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND
7780-274562-0075 DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR WHICH HID FROM THE COMMON OBSERVER ARE REVEALED EVERYWHERE TO THE EXPERIENCED STUDENT OF NATURE THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING
7780-274562-0076 IN THE PREVALENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL HARMONY AND ORDER THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES THE ARTIFICIAL STYLE HAS AS MANY VARIETIES AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT TASTES TO GRATIFY
7780-274562-0077 IT HAS A CERTAIN GENERAL RELATION TO THE VARIOUS STYLES OF BUILDING THERE ARE THE STATELY AVENUES AND RETIREMENTS OF VERSAILLES ITALIAN TERRACES AND A VARIOUS MIXED OLD ENGLISH STYLE
7780-274562-0078 WHICH BEARS SOME RELATION TO THE DOMESTIC GOTHIC OR ENGLISH ELIZABETHAN ARCHITECTURE WHATEVER MAY BE SAID AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE GARDENING
7780-274562-0079 A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
7780-274562-0080 CALLS UP AT ONCE TO THE EYE THE FAIR FORMS THAT HAVE PASSED THERE IN OTHER DAYS THE SLIGHTEST EXHIBITION OF ART IS AN EVIDENCE OF CARE AND HUMAN INTEREST
7780-274562-0081 FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED SAID MISTER ELLISON YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT THE IDEA HERE EXPRESSED OF RECALLING THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY
7780-274562-0082 THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY IS NEVER SO GREAT AS THAT WHICH MAY BE INTRODUCED OF COURSE MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE SELECTION OF A SPOT WITH CAPABILITIES
7780-274562-0083 WHAT IS SAID IN RESPECT TO THE DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR IS A MERE VAGUENESS OF SPEECH WHICH MAY MEAN MUCH OR LITTLE OR NOTHING
7780-274562-0084 THAT THE TRUE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING IS SEEN RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DEFECTS AND INCONGRUITIES THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES
7780-274562-0085 IS A PROPOSITION BETTER SUITED TO THE GROVELLING APPREHENSION OF THE HERD THAN TO THE FERVID DREAMS OF THE MAN OF GENIUS THE MERIT SUGGESTED IS AT BEST NEGATIVE
7780-274562-0086 AND APPERTAINS TO THAT HOBBLING CRITICISM WHICH IN LETTERS WOULD ELEVATE ADDISON INTO APOTHEOSIS IN TRUTH
7780-274562-0087 APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
7780-274562-0088 RULE APPLIES BUT TO THE EXCELLENCES OF AVOIDANCE TO THE VIRTUES WHICH DENY OR REFRAIN BEYOND THESE THE CRITICAL ART CAN BUT SUGGEST
7780-274562-0089 WE MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO BUILD AN ODYSSEY BUT IT IS IN VAIN THAT WE ARE TOLD HOW TO CONCEIVE A TEMPEST AN INFERNO A PROMETHEUS BOUND A NIGHTINGALE
7780-274562-0090 SUCH AS THAT OF KEATS OR THE SENSITIVE PLANT OF SHELLEY BUT THE THING DONE
7780-274562-0091 THE SOPHISTS OF THE NEGATIVE SCHOOL WHO THROUGH INABILITY TO CREATE HAVE SCOFFED AT CREATION ARE NOW FOUND THE LOUDEST IN APPLAUSE WHAT
7780-274562-0092 IN ITS CHRYSALIS CONDITION OF PRINCIPLE AFFRONTED THEIR DEMURE REASON NEVER FAILS IN ITS MATURITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TO EXTORT ADMIRATION FROM THEIR INSTINCT OF THE BEAUTIFUL OR OF THE SUBLIME
7780-274562-0093 ARE LESS OBJECTIONABLE A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS JUST AND THE REFERENCE TO THE SENSE OF HUMAN INTEREST IS EQUALLY SO
7780-274562-0094 I REPEAT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPRESSED IS INCONTROVERTIBLE BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING EVEN BEYOND IT THERE MAY BE AN OBJECT IN FULL KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED
7780-274562-0095 YET WHICH IF ATTAINED WOULD LEND A CHARM TO THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN IMMEASURABLY SURPASSING THAT WHICH A MERELY HUMAN INTEREST COULD BESTOW
7780-274562-0096 SO IMBUE HIS DESIGNS AT ONCE WITH EXTENT AND NOVELTY OF BEAUTY AS TO CONVEY THE SENTIMENT OF SPIRITUAL INTERFERENCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN BRINGING ABOUT SUCH RESULT
7780-274562-0097 HE SECURES ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF INTEREST OR DESIGN WHILE RELIEVING HIS WORK OF ALL THE HARSHNESS AND TECHNICALITY OF ART
7780-274562-0098 IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF THE SCENES OF PURE NATURE THERE IS APPARENT THE ART OF A CREATOR YET IS THIS ART APPARENT ONLY TO REFLECTION IN NO RESPECT HAS IT THE OBVIOUS FORCE OF A FEELING
7780-274562-0099 NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
7780-274562-0100 DEFINITIVENESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SHALL INSPIRE THE IDEA OF CULTURE OR CARE OR SUPERINTENDENCE ON THE PART OF INTELLIGENCES SUPERIOR YET AKIN TO HUMANITY
7780-274562-0101 THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
7780-274562-0102 IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS THE HANDIWORK OF THE ANGELS THAT HOVER BETWEEN MAN AND GOD IT WAS IN DEVOTING HIS GIGANTIC WEALTH TO THE PRACTICAL EMBODIMENT OF A VISION SUCH AS THIS
7780-274562-0103 IN THE FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR WHICH RESULTED FROM PERSONAL DIRECTION OF HIS PLANS IN THE CONTINUOUS AND UNCEASING OBJECT WHICH THESE PLANS AFFORD
7780-274562-0104 IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION WHICH IT ENABLED HIM MORE TO FEEL THAN TO AFFECT AND LASTLY IT WAS IN THE COMPANIONSHIP AND SYMPATHY OF A DEVOTED WIFE
7780-274562-0105 THAT ELLISON THOUGHT TO FIND AND FOUND AN EXEMPTION FROM THE ORDINARY CARES OF HUMANITY
3440-171009-0000 THE YOUNG PARTY AT ROSELANDS HAD NOW GROWN SO LARGE SEVERAL ADDITIONS HAVING BEEN MADE TO IT ON MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THAT A SEPARATE TABLE WAS ORDERED TO BE SPREAD FOR THEM IN THE NURSERY WHERE THEY TOOK THEIR MEALS TOGETHER
3440-171009-0001 MISSUS BROWN THE HOUSEKEEPER TAKING THE HEAD OF THE TABLE FOR THE DOUBLE PURPOSE OF KEEPING THEM IN ORDER AND SEEING THAT THEIR WANTS WERE WELL SUPPLIED ELSIE CAME IN TO BREAKFAST FROM A BRISK WALK WITH HER PAPA LOOKING FRESH AND ROSY AND BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
3440-171009-0002 QUITE DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE LITTLE GUESTS WHO HAD BEEN UP FAR BEYOND THEIR USUAL HOURS THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HAVING JUST LEFT THEIR BEDS HAD COME DOWN PALE AND LANGUID IN LOOKS AND IN SOME INSTANCES SHOWING PEEVISH AND FRETFUL TEMPERS
3440-171009-0003 VERY TRYING TO THE PATIENCE OF THEIR ATTENDANTS O ELSIE EXCLAIMED CARRY HOWARD
3440-171009-0004 WE WERE ALL SO SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE US SO SOON LAST NIGHT WE HAD LOTS OF FUN AFTER YOU LEFT I THINK YOUR PAPA MIGHT HAVE LET YOU STAY UP A LITTLE LONGER BUT HE HAS PROMISED THAT TONIGHT AS WE ARE TO HAVE THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND EVER SO MUCH WILL BE GOING ON
3440-171009-0005 LATE HOURS AND RICH FOOD ARE VERY BAD FOR LITTLE FOLKS AND I NOTICE THAT MISS ELSIE HAS GROWN A DEAL STRONGER AND HEALTHIER LOOKING SINCE HER PAPA CAME HOME HE TAKES SUCH GOOD CARE OF HER INDEED HE DOES SAID ELSIE HEARTILY THANKING MISSUS BROWN WITH ONE OF HER SWEETEST SMILES
3440-171009-0006 WHATEVER YOU ALL PREFER SAID ELSIE IF YOU LIKE I WILL PRACTICE THAT DUET WITH YOU THE FIRST HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST OR DO ANYTHING ELSE YOU WISH BUT THE SECOND HOUR I MUST SPEND WITH PAPA AND AFTER THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT ENTERTAIN MY COMPANY ALL DAY
3440-171009-0007 DO YOU DO LESSONS IN HOLIDAYS ASKED MARY LESLIE A MERRY FUN LOVING CHILD ABOUT ELSIE'S OWN AGE WHO CONSIDERED LESSONS AN INTOLERABLE BORE AND HAD SOME VAGUE IDEA THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN INVENTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TORMENTING CHILDREN
3440-171009-0008 HER BLUE EYES OPENED WIDE WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN ELSIE QUIETLY REPLIED THAT HER PAPA HAD KINDLY ARRANGED TO GIVE HER AN HOUR EVERY MORNING
3440-171009-0009 THAN SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY IN PLAY ELSIE DID KEENLY ENJOY THAT QUIET HOUR SPENT IN STUDYING AND RECITING TO HER FATHER SITTING ON A LOW STOOL AT HIS FEET OR PERHAPS OFTENER ON HIS KNEE WITH HIS ARM AROUND HER WAIST
3440-171009-0010 LOVING ALSO HIS LITTLE PUPIL WITH ALL A FATHER'S FOND YEARNING AFFECTION DELIGHTED IN HIS TASK WHEN ELSIE LEFT HER FATHER SHE FOUND THAT THE CARRINGTONS HAD JUST ARRIVED
3440-171009-0011 SHE AND LUCY HAD NOT SEEN EACH OTHER SINCE THE WEEK THE LATTER HAD SPENT AT ROSELANDS EARLY IN THE SUMMER AND BOTH FELT PLEASED TO MEET MISSUS CARRINGTON GAVE ELSIE A WARM EMBRACE REMARKING THAT SHE HAD GROWN AND WAS LOOKING EXTREMELY WELL BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER SEEN HER
3440-171009-0012 BUT NO ONE WAS MORE DELIGHTED TO MEET ELSIE THAN HERBERT AND SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO LEARN THAT HIS HEALTH WAS GRADUALLY IMPROVING HE WAS NOT HOWEVER AT ALL STRONG EVEN YET AND HIS MOTHER THOUGHT IT BEST FOR HIM TO LIE DOWN AND REST A LITTLE AFTER HIS RIDE
3440-171009-0013 A VARIETY OF STORY BOOKS TOYS AND GAMES HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR THEIR AMUSEMENT ELSIE'S ENTRANCE WAS HAILED WITH DELIGHT FOR SHE WAS A GENERAL FAVORITE OH ELSIE CAN'T YOU TELL US WHAT TO PLAY CRIED MARY LESLIE I'M SO TIRED
3440-171009-0014 AND SHE YAWNED WEARILY HERE ARE SOME DISSECTED MAPS MARY REPLIED ELSIE OPENING A DRAWER WOULD YOU NOT LIKE THEM NO INDEED THANK YOU THEY ARE TOO MUCH LIKE LESSONS
3440-171009-0015 WILL YOU PLAY JACK STONES HERE ARE SOME SMOOTH PEBBLES YES IF YOU AND CARRY AND LUCY WILL PLAY WITH ME AGREED SAID THE OTHERS LET'S HAVE A GAME SO ELSIE HAVING FIRST SET THE LITTLE ONES TO BUILDING BLOCK HOUSES
3440-171009-0016 SUPPLIED HARRY CARRINGTON AN OLDER BROTHER OF LUCY'S WITH A BOOK AND TWO YOUNGER BOYS WITH DISSECTED MAPS TO ARRANGE THE FOUR GIRLS SAT DOWN IN A CIRCLE ON THE CARPET AND BEGAN THEIR GAME FOR A FEW MOMENTS ALL WENT ON SMOOTHLY
3440-171009-0017 WHO WAS SOBBING AND WIPING HER EYES WITH THE CORNER OF HER APRON ENNA TOOK MY BLOCKS SOBBED THE CHILD
3440-171009-0018 YOU KNOW FLORA IS A VISITOR AND WE MUST BE VERY POLITE TO HER NO I WON'T RETURNED ENNA FLATLY SHE'S GOT ENOUGH NOW NO I HAVEN'T I CAN'T BUILD A HOUSE WITH THOSE FLORA SAID WITH ANOTHER SOB
3440-171009-0019 ELSIE STOOD A MOMENT LOOKING MUCH PERPLEXED THEN WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE EXCLAIMED IN HER CHEERFUL PLEASANT WAY WELL NEVER MIND FLORA DEAR I WILL GET YOU MY DOLL
3440-171009-0020 THE LITTLE WEEPER ANSWERED EAGERLY SMILING THROUGH HER TEARS ELSIE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND WAS BACK AGAIN ALMOST IN A MOMENT WITH THE DOLL IN HER ARMS THERE DEAR LITTLE FLORA SHE SAID LAYING IT GENTLY ON THE CHILD'S LAP
3440-171009-0021 PLEASE BE CAREFUL OF IT FOR I HAVE HAD IT A LONG WHILE AND PRIZE IT VERY MUCH BECAUSE MY GUARDIAN GAVE IT TO ME WHEN I WAS A VERY LITTLE GIRL AND HE IS DEAD NOW I WON'T BREAK IT ELSIE INDEED I WON'T REPLIED FLORA CONFIDENTLY
3440-171009-0022 AND ELSIE SAT DOWN TO HER GAME AGAIN A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARD MISTER HORACE DINSMORE PASSED THROUGH THE ROOM ELSIE HE SAID AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER GO UP TO MY DRESSING ROOM THERE WAS EVIDENTLY DISPLEASURE AND REPROOF IN HIS TONE
3440-171009-0023 MISTER DINSMORE PASSED OUT OF ONE DOOR WHILE ELSIE LEFT BY THE OTHER THE THREE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED INQUIRINGLY INTO EACH OTHER'S FACES WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT HAS ELSIE DONE ASKED CARRY IN A WHISPER I DON'T KNOW
3440-171009-0024 NOTHING I GUESS REPLIED LUCY INDIGNANTLY I DO BELIEVE HE'S JUST THE CROSSEST MAN ALIVE WHEN I WAS HERE LAST SUMMER HE WAS ALL THE TIME SCOLDING AND PUNISHING POOR ELSIE FOR JUST NOTHING AT ALL I THINK HE MUST BE VERY STRICT SAID CARRY
3440-171009-0025 AND THAT WAS THE CONCLUSION THEY ALL CAME TO IN THE MEANTIME ELSIE SAT DOWN ALONE IN HER BANISHMENT AND TRIED TO THINK WHAT SHE COULD HAVE DONE TO DESERVE IT IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FORM ANY IDEA OF ITS CAUSE
3440-171009-0026 BUT AT LENGTH IT SUDDENLY CAME TO HER RECOLLECTION THAT ONCE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THIS HER FATHER HAD FOUND HER SITTING ON THE CARPET AND HAD BADE HER GET UP IMMEDIATELY AND SIT ON A CHAIR OR STOOL SAYING NEVER LET ME SEE YOU SITTING ON THE FLOOR ELSIE
3440-171009-0027 WHEN THERE ARE PLENTY OF SEATS AT HAND I CONSIDER IT A VERY UNLADYLIKE AND SLOVENLY TRICK SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SAT THUS FOR SOME MOMENTS FEELING VERY SORRY FOR HER FORGETFULNESS AND DISOBEDIENCE VERY PENITENT ON ACCOUNT OF IT
3440-171009-0028 AND THEN KNEELING DOWN SHE ASKED FORGIVENESS OF GOD A FULL HOUR SHE HAD BEEN THERE ALONE AND THE TIME HAD SEEMED VERY LONG WHEN AT LAST THE DOOR OPENED AND HER FATHER CAME IN ELSIE ROSE AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HIM
3440-171009-0029 WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO HAD OFFENDED AND KNEW SHE WAS IN DISGRACE BUT PUTTING ONE OF HER LITTLE HANDS IN HIS SHE LOOKED UP PLEADINGLY INTO HIS FACE ASKING IN A SLIGHTLY TREMULOUS TONE DEAR PAPA ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME
3440-171009-0030 I AM ALWAYS DISPLEASED WHEN YOU DISOBEY ME ELSIE HE REPLIED VERY GRAVELY LAYING HIS OTHER HAND ON HER HEAD I AM VERY SORRY I WAS NAUGHTY PAPA SHE SAID HUMBLY AND CASTING DOWN HER EYES
3440-171009-0031 NO SIR I DID NOT MEAN IT SO AND I AM VERY VERY SORRY DEAR PAPA PLEASE FORGIVE ME AND I WILL TRY NEVER TO FORGET AGAIN I THINK YOU DISOBEYED IN ANOTHER MATTER HE SAID
3440-171009-0032 BUT I THINK I WILL REMEMBER NOT TO DO IT AGAIN
3440-171009-0033 SHE HELD UP HER FACE FOR A KISS WHICH HE GAVE I WISH I COULD ALWAYS BE GOOD PAPA SHE SAID BUT I AM NAUGHTY SO OFTEN NO SAID HE I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
3440-171009-0034 AND ELSIE FOUND THE CHILDREN IN THE NURSERY ENGAGED IN EATING FLORA TURNED TO HER AS SHE ENTERED PLEASE ELSIE DON'T BE CROSS SHE SAID COAXINGLY I AM REAL SORRY YOUR DOLL'S BROKEN BUT IT WASN'T MY FAULT ENNA WOULD TRY TO SNATCH IT

3440-171009-0082 THAT ELSIE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED WHEN HER FATHER CALLED HER TO GO TO BED IS IT HALF PAST NINE ALREADY PAPA SHE ASKED
405-130895-0000 FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON HOW I GOT ONTO THE PLATFORM I'M UNABLE TO SAY PERHAPS THE CANADIAN TRANSFERRED ME THERE BUT I COULD BREATHE I COULD INHALE THE LIFE GIVING SEA AIR
405-130895-0001 NEXT TO ME MY TWO COMPANIONS WERE GETTING TIPSY ON THE FRESH OXYGEN PARTICLES POOR SOULS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LONG STARVATION MUSTN'T POUNCE HEEDLESSLY ON THE FIRST FOOD GIVEN THEM WE ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE SUCH MODERATION
405-130895-0002 WE COULD SUCK THE ATOMS FROM THE AIR BY THE LUNGFUL AND IT WAS THE BREEZE THE BREEZE ITSELF THAT POURED INTO US THIS LUXURIOUS INTOXICATION AHHH CONSEIL WAS PUTTING IN
405-130895-0003 WHAT FINE OXYGEN LET MASTER HAVE NO FEARS ABOUT BREATHING THERE'S ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AS FOR NED LAND HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD BUT HIS WIDE OPEN JAWS WOULD HAVE SCARED OFF A SHARK
405-130895-0004 AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM NO CREWMEN
405-130895-0005 THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
405-130895-0006 AND GRATITUDE TO MY TWO COMPANIONS NED AND CONSEIL HAD KEPT ME ALIVE DURING THE FINAL HOURS OF OUR LONG DEATH THROES BUT NO EXPRESSION OF THANKS COULD REPAY THEM FULLY FOR SUCH DEVOTION
405-130895-0007 GOOD LORD PROFESSOR NED LAND ANSWERED ME DON'T MENTION IT WHAT DID WE DO THAT'S SO PRAISEWORTHY NOT A THING IT WAS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC YOUR LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN OURS SO WE HAD TO SAVE IT
405-130895-0008 AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
405-130895-0009 IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY IN A MANNER OF CONFOUNDED BY THIS LAPSE INTO BANALITY CONSEIL LEFT HIS SENTENCE HANGING MY FRIENDS I REPLIED VERY MOVED
405-130895-0010 WE'RE BOUND TO EACH OTHER FOREVER AND I'M DEEPLY INDEBTED TO YOU WHICH I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
405-130895-0011 CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
405-130895-0012 YES I REPLIED BECAUSE WE'RE GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN AND HERE THE SUN IS DUE NORTH SURE NED LAND WENT ON BUT IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER WE'LL MAKE FOR THE ATLANTIC OR THE PACIFIC
405-130895-0013 BUT IF WE RETURNED TO THE PACIFIC FAR FROM EVERY POPULATED SHORE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO NED LAND'S PLANS WE WOULD SOON SETTLE THIS IMPORTANT POINT THE NAUTILUS TRAVELED SWIFTLY
405-130895-0014 SOON WE HAD CLEARED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE PLUS THE PROMONTORY OF CAPE HORN
405-130895-0015 BY THEN ALL OUR PAST SUFFERINGS WERE FORGOTTEN THE MEMORY OF THAT IMPRISONMENT UNDER THE ICE FADED FROM OUR MINDS WE HAD THOUGHTS ONLY OF THE FUTURE
405-130895-0016 NOW THEN THAT EVENING IT BECAME OBVIOUS MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION THAT WE WERE RETURNING NORTH BY THE ATLANTIC ROUTE I SHARED THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS WITH THE CANADIAN AND CONSEIL
405-130895-0017 THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE
405-130895-0018 WE'LL NEVER REGRET HAVING KNOWN HIM ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE LEFT HIM NED LAND SHOT BACK THE NEXT DAY
405-130895-0019 WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
405-130895-0020 THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE
405-130895-0021 ITS COASTLINE LOOKED FLAT BUT HIGH MOUNTAINS ROSE IN THE DISTANCE I EVEN THOUGHT I GLIMPSED MT SARMIENTO
405-130895-0022 A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
405-130895-0023 YES SIR A NATURAL BAROMETER THAT DIDN'T LET ME DOWN WHEN I NAVIGATED THE NARROWS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN JUST THEN ITS PEAK APPEARED BEFORE US STANDING OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE SKIES THIS FORECAST FAIR WEATHER
405-130895-0024 BULB BEARING SEAWEED OF WHICH THE OPEN SEA AT THE POLE HAD REVEALED A FEW SPECIMENS WITH THEIR SMOOTH VISCOUS FILAMENTS THEY MEASURED AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED METERS LONG GENUINE CABLES MORE THAN AN INCH THICK AND VERY TOUGH
405-130895-0025 IT SERVED AS BOTH NEST AND NOURISHMENT FOR MYRIADS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSKS FOR CRABS AND CUTTLEFISH HERE SEALS AND OTTERS COULD INDULGE IN A SUMPTUOUS MEAL MIXING MEAT FROM FISH
405-130895-0026 WITH VEGETABLES FROM THE SEA LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR IRISH STEWS THE NAUTILUS PASSED OVER THESE LUSH LUXURIANT DEPTHS WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
405-130895-0027 IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
405-130895-0028 AS FOR FISH I SPECIFICALLY OBSERVED SOME BONY FISH BELONGING TO THE GOBY GENUS ESPECIALLY SOME GUDGEON TWO DECIMETERS LONG SPRINKLED WITH WHITISH AND YELLOW SPOTS
405-130895-0029 I LIKEWISE MARVELED AT THE NUMEROUS MEDUSAS INCLUDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEIR BREED THE COMPASS JELLYFISH UNIQUE TO THE FALKLAND SEAS
405-130895-0030 SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS OTHERS LOOKED LIKE
405-130895-0031 UPSIDE DOWN BASKETS FROM WHICH WIDE LEAVES AND LONG RED TWIGS WERE GRACEFULLY TRAILING THEY SWAM WITH QUIVERINGS OF THEIR FOUR LEAFLIKE ARMS LETTING THE OPULENT TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES DANGLE IN THE DRIFT
405-130895-0032 SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON
405-130895-0033 BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE METERS AND WENT ALONG THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST
405-130895-0034 DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
405-130895-0035 KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
405-130895-0036 NEAR ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE CUT THE TROPIC OF CAPRICORN ON THE THIRTY SEVENTH MERIDIAN PASSING WELL OUT FROM CAPE FRIO MUCH TO NED LAND'S DISPLEASURE
405-130895-0037 CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NO LIKING FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRAZIL'S POPULOUS SHORES BECAUSE HE SHOT BY WITH DIZZYING SPEED

5514-19193-0001 CONTINUED TO INSULT THE CANNON AND EACH TIME THAT THAT GLOOMY CLOUD OF PROJECTILES WHICH IS CALLED GRAPE SHOT PASSED OVERHEAD WITH ITS TERRIBLE SOUND HE ASSAILED IT WITH A BURST OF IRONY YOU ARE WEARING OUT YOUR LUNGS POOR BRUTAL OLD FELLOW
5514-19193-0002 YOU PAIN ME YOU ARE WASTING YOUR ROW THAT'S NOT THUNDER IT'S A COUGH AND THE BYSTANDERS LAUGHED

5514-19193-0005 HE IS NOT IN LOVE AND YET HE MANAGES TO BE INTREPID IT IS A THING UNHEARD OF THAT A MAN SHOULD BE AS COLD AS ICE AND AS BOLD AS FIRE
5514-19193-0006 HAD ANY ONE BEEN NEAR HIM THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM MUTTER IN A LOW VOICE PATRIA
5514-19193-0007 AND ASSUMING THE TONE OF AN USHER MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT HE ADDED MY NAME IS EIGHT POUNDER IN FACT A NEW PERSONAGE HAD ENTERED ON THE SCENE THIS WAS A SECOND PIECE OF ORDNANCE
5514-19193-0008 AND PLACED THIS SECOND PIECE IN LINE WITH THE FIRST THIS OUTLINED THE CATASTROPHE A FEW MINUTES LATER THE TWO PIECES RAPIDLY SERVED WERE FIRING POINT BLANK AT THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0009 THE PLATOON FIRING OF THE LINE AND OF THE SOLDIERS FROM THE SUBURBS SUSTAINED THE ARTILLERY ANOTHER CANNONADE WAS AUDIBLE AT SOME DISTANCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE TWO GUNS WERE FURIOUSLY ATTACKING THE REDOUBT FROM THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE
5514-19193-0010 THE FOUR CANNONS ECHOED EACH OTHER MOURNFULLY THE BARKING OF THESE SOMBRE DOGS OF WAR REPLIED TO EACH OTHER
5514-19193-0011 THE OTHER BALLS THE PIECE WHICH WAS FIRING BALLS WAS POINTED A LITTLE HIGH AND THE AIM WAS CALCULATED SO THAT THE BALL STRUCK THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE UPPER CREST OF THE BARRICADE AND CRUMBLED THE STONE DOWN UPON THE INSURGENTS MINGLED WITH BURSTS OF GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0012 THE OBJECT OF THIS MODE OF FIRING WAS TO DRIVE THE INSURGENTS FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE REDOUBT AND TO COMPEL THEM TO GATHER CLOSE IN THE INTERIOR THAT IS TO SAY THIS ANNOUNCED THE ASSAULT THE COMBATANTS ONCE DRIVEN FROM THE CREST OF THE BARRICADE BY BALLS AND
5514-19193-0013 FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CABARET BY GRAPE SHOT THE ATTACKING COLUMNS COULD VENTURE INTO THE STREET WITHOUT BEING PICKED OFF PERHAPS EVEN WITHOUT BEING SEEN COULD BRISKLY AND SUDDENLY SCALE THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0014 AND HE SHOUTED FIRE ON THE ARTILLERY MEN ALL WERE READY THE BARRICADE WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SILENT POURED FORTH A DESPERATE FIRE SEVEN OR EIGHT DISCHARGES FOLLOWED WITH A SORT OF RAGE AND JOY
5514-19193-0015 THE STREET WAS FILLED WITH BLINDING SMOKE AND AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES ATHWART THIS MIST ALL STREAKED WITH FLAME TWO THIRDS OF THE GUNNERS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED LYING BENEATH THE WHEELS OF THE CANNONS
5514-19193-0016 THOSE WHO WERE LEFT STANDING CONTINUED TO SERVE THE PIECES WITH SEVERE TRANQUILLITY BUT THE FIRE HAD SLACKENED THINGS ARE GOING WELL NOW SAID BOSSUET TO ENJOLRAS SUCCESS
5514-19193-0017 ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THIS SUCCESS AND THERE WILL NOT BE ANY CARTRIDGES LEFT IN THE BARRICADE IT APPEARS THAT GAVROCHE OVERHEARD THIS REMARK CHAPTER FIFTEEN GAVROCHE OUTSIDE
5514-19193-0018 COURFEYRAC SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME ONE AT THE BASE OF THE BARRICADE OUTSIDE IN THE STREET AMID THE BULLETS GAVROCHE HAD TAKEN A BOTTLE BASKET FROM THE WINE SHOP HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH THE CUT AND WAS QUIETLY ENGAGED IN EMPTYING

5514-19193-0020 GAVROCHE REPLIED WELL IT IS RAINING WHAT THEN COURFEYRAC SHOUTED COME IN INSTANTER SAID GAVROCHE AND WITH A SINGLE BOUND HE PLUNGED INTO THE STREET
5514-19193-0021 IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT FANNICOT'S COMPANY HAD LEFT BEHIND IT A TRAIL OF BODIES TWENTY CORPSES LAY SCATTERED HERE AND THERE ON THE PAVEMENT THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE STREET TWENTY CARTOUCHES FOR GAVROCHE MEANT A PROVISION OF CARTRIDGES FOR THE BARRICADE
5514-19193-0022 THE SMOKE IN THE STREET WAS LIKE A FOG WHOEVER HAS BEHELD A CLOUD WHICH HAS FALLEN INTO A MOUNTAIN GORGE BETWEEN TWO PEAKED ESCARPMENTS CAN IMAGINE THIS SMOKE RENDERED DENSER AND THICKER BY TWO GLOOMY ROWS OF LOFTY HOUSES
5514-19193-0023 IT ROSE GRADUALLY AND WAS INCESSANTLY RENEWED HENCE A TWILIGHT WHICH MADE EVEN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT TURN PALE THE COMBATANTS COULD HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER SHORT AS IT WAS
5514-19193-0024 THIS OBSCURITY WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN DESIRED AND CALCULATED ON BY THE COMMANDERS WHO WERE TO DIRECT THE ASSAULT ON THE BARRICADE WAS USEFUL TO GAVROCHE BENEATH THE FOLDS OF THIS VEIL OF SMOKE AND THANKS TO HIS SMALL SIZE
5514-19193-0025 HE RIFLED THE FIRST SEVEN OR EIGHT CARTRIDGE BOXES WITHOUT MUCH DANGER HE CRAWLED FLAT ON HIS BELLY GALLOPED ON ALL FOURS TOOK HIS BASKET IN HIS TEETH TWISTED GLIDED UNDULATED WOUND FROM ONE DEAD BODY TO ANOTHER
5514-19193-0026 AND EMPTIED THE CARTRIDGE BOX OR CARTOUCHE AS A MONKEY OPENS A NUT THEY DID NOT DARE TO SHOUT TO HIM TO RETURN FROM THE BARRICADE WHICH WAS QUITE NEAR FOR FEAR OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION TO HIM ON ONE BODY THAT OF A CORPORAL HE FOUND A POWDER FLASK
5514-19193-0027 FOR THIRST SAID HE PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET BY DINT OF ADVANCING HE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE FOG OF THE FUSILLADE BECAME TRANSPARENT SO THAT THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE LINE RANGED ON THE OUTLOOK BEHIND THEIR PAVING STONE DIKE
5514-19193-0028 AND THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE BANLIEUE MASSED AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET SUDDENLY POINTED OUT TO EACH OTHER SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SMOKE AT THE MOMENT WHEN GAVROCHE WAS RELIEVING A SERGEANT WHO WAS LYING NEAR A STONE DOOR POST OF HIS CARTRIDGES A BULLET STRUCK THE BODY
5514-19193-0029 FICHTRE EJACULATED GAVROCHE THEY ARE KILLING MY DEAD MEN FOR ME A SECOND BULLET STRUCK A SPARK FROM THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM A THIRD OVERTURNED HIS BASKET
5514-19193-0030 IT WAS A CHARMING AND TERRIBLE SIGHT GAVROCHE THOUGH SHOT AT WAS TEASING THE FUSILLADE HE HAD THE AIR OF BEING GREATLY DIVERTED IT WAS THE SPARROW PECKING AT THE SPORTSMEN TO EACH DISCHARGE HE RETORTED WITH A COUPLET
5514-19193-0031 THEY AIMED AT HIM CONSTANTLY AND ALWAYS MISSED HIM THE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND THE SOLDIERS LAUGHED AS THEY TOOK AIM AT HIM HE LAY DOWN SPRANG TO HIS FEET HID IN THE CORNER OF A DOORWAY THEN MADE A BOUND DISAPPEARED RE APPEARED SCAMPERED AWAY RETURNED
5514-19193-0032 REPLIED TO THE GRAPE SHOT WITH HIS THUMB AT HIS NOSE AND ALL THE WHILE WENT ON PILLAGING THE CARTOUCHES EMPTYING THE CARTRIDGE BOXES AND FILLING HIS BASKET THE INSURGENTS PANTING WITH ANXIETY FOLLOWED HIM WITH THEIR EYES THE BARRICADE TREMBLED HE SANG
5514-19193-0033 HE WAS NOT A CHILD HE WAS NOT A MAN HE WAS A STRANGE GAMIN FAIRY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED THE INVULNERABLE DWARF OF THE FRAY THE BULLETS FLEW AFTER HIM HE WAS MORE NIMBLE THAN THEY HE PLAYED A FEARFUL GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK WITH DEATH
5514-19193-0034 EVERY TIME THAT THE FLAT NOSED FACE OF THE SPECTRE APPROACHED THE URCHIN ADMINISTERED TO IT A FILLIP ONE BULLET HOWEVER BETTER AIMED OR MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THE REST FINALLY STRUCK THE WILL O' THE WISP OF A CHILD
5514-19193-0035 GAVROCHE WAS SEEN TO STAGGER THEN HE SANK TO THE EARTH THE WHOLE BARRICADE GAVE VENT TO A CRY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ANTAEUS IN THAT PYGMY FOR THE GAMIN TO TOUCH THE PAVEMENT IS THE SAME AS FOR THE GIANT TO TOUCH THE EARTH GAVROCHE HAD FALLEN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN

5561-41616-0002 THEY MUST TURN IN TWO THEMES EVERY WEEK OF NOT LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED WORDS ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS TO BE ASSIGNED TO THEM IF DURING THIS TIME ANY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE REPORTED FOR A MISDEMEANOR THEY WERE TO BE SUSPENDED WITHOUT DELAY
5561-41616-0003 THEIR PENALTY WAS FAR FROM LIGHT BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SUSPENDED AND SO THEY RESOLVED TO ENDURE IT AS BEST THEY MIGHT GRACE HARLOWE FELT A LOAD LIFTED FROM HER MIND WHEN MISS THOMPSON PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM EITHER MABEL ALLISON OR THE PHI SIGMA TAU
5561-41616-0004 THANK GOODNESS NONE OF US WERE CONCERNED IN THAT AFFAIR SHE TOLD THE MEMBERS OF HER BASKETBALL TEAM AT RECESS THERE ARE TWO GIRLS ON THE SOPHOMORE AND THREE ON THE FRESHMAN TEAM WHOSE BASKETBALL ARDOR WILL HAVE TO COOL UNTIL AFTER THE MID YEAR EXAMS

5561-41616-0010 WASN'T IT NICE OF MISS THOMPSON TO EXONERATE US PUBLICLY ASKED ANNE SHE IS ALWAYS JUST REPLIED GRACE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW ELEANOR COULD BE SO RUDE AND DISAGREEABLE TO HER SHE HAS DISLIKED MISS THOMPSON FROM THE FIRST I WONDER WHETHER SHE APOLOGIZED TO MISS THOMPSON LAST NIGHT MUSED GRACE
5561-41616-0011 I FEEL SURE THAT SHE DIDN'T AND I AM JUST AS SURE THAT SHE WON'T GET BACK UNTIL SHE DOES WE SHALL MANAGE TO EXIST IF SHE DOESN'T SAID JESSICA DRYLY
5561-41616-0012 SHE FELT A PERSONAL GRUDGE AGAINST ELEANOR FOR HER ACCUSATION AGAINST MABEL WHO HAD GROWN VERY DEAR TO HER AND WHOM SHE MOTHERED LIKE A HEN WITH ONE CHICKEN SHE'LL PROBABLY APPEAR AT THE GAME IN ALL HER GLORY SAID MIRIAM NESBIT
5561-41616-0013 THE RECESS BELL CUT SHORT THE CONVERSATION AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR DESKS WITH FAR BETTER IDEAS OF THE COMING GAME THAN OF THE AFTERNOON'S LESSONS SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH DAWNED COLD AND CLEAR AND THE GIRLS ON BOTH TEAMS WERE IN HIGH SPIRITS AS THEY HUSTLED INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCKER ROOMS
5561-41616-0014 AND RAPIDLY DONNED THEIR GYMNASIUM SUITS THE SPECTATORS HAD NOT YET BEGUN TO ARRIVE AS IT WAS STILL EARLY SO THE GIRLS INDULGED IN A LITTLE WARMING UP PRACTICE DID A FEW STUNTS AND SKIPPED ABOUT OVERFLOWING WITH ANIMAL SPIRITS
5561-41616-0015 JULIA CROSBY AND GRACE TOOK TURNS SPRINTING AROUND THE GYMNASIUM THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION WHILE MIRIAM NESBIT TIMED THEM GRACE FINISHING JUST TWO SECONDS AHEAD OF JULIA BY A QUARTER OF TWO THE GALLERY WAS FAIRLY WELL FILLED AND BY FIVE MINUTES OF TWO IT WAS CROWDED
5561-41616-0016 THE JUNIORS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR SAVELL'S FACTION ARRIVED IN A BODY GAVE THE HIGH SCHOOL YELL THE MOMENT THEY SPIED THEIR TEAM
5561-41616-0017 A TALL JUNIOR WHO STOOD UP AND BEAT TIME WITH BOTH HANDS ANNE HAD COMPOSED THE SONG THE WEEK BEFORE THE JUNIORS HAD ALL RECEIVED COPIES OF THE WORDS AND HAD LEARNED THEM BY HEART THEY NOW SANG WITH THE UTMOST GLEE AND CAME OUT PARTICULARLY STRONG ON THE CHORUS WHICH RAN

5561-41616-0022 AND SENT IT FLYING TOWARD MIRIAM WHO WAS SO CAREFULLY GUARDED THAT SHE DARED NOT ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE BASKET AND AFTER A FEINT MANAGED TO THROW IT TO NORA WHO TRIED FOR THE BASKET AT LONG RANGE AND MISSED THERE WAS A GENERAL SCRAMBLE FOR THE BALL AND FOR FIVE MINUTES NEITHER TEAM SCORED
5561-41616-0023 THEN MARIAN BARBER DROPPED A NEAT FIELD GOAL AND SOON AFTER GRACE SCORED ON A FOUL THE JUNIOR FANS HOWLED JOYFULLY AT THE GOOD WORK OF THEIR TEAM THE SENIORS DID NOT INTEND TO ALLOW THEM TO SCORE AGAIN IN A HURRY
5561-41616-0024 THEY PLAYED SUCH A CLOSE GUARDING GAME THAT TRY AS THEY MIGHT THE JUNIORS MADE NO HEADWAY THEN JULIA CROSBY SCORED ON A FIELD GOAL MAKING THE SCORE THREE TO TWO THIS SPURRED THE JUNIOR TEAM ON TO GREATER EFFORT AND MIRIAM MADE A BRILLIANT THROW TO BASKET THAT BROUGHT FORTH AN OVATION FROM THE GALLERY
5561-41616-0025 THIS ENDED THE FIRST HALF WITH THE SCORE FIVE TO TWO IN FAVOR OF THE JUNIORS THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK TO CATCH UP WITH US NOW SAID NORA O'MALLEY TRIUMPHANTLY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE TEAM WHO SAT RESTING IN THE LITTLE SIDE ROOM OFF THE GYMNASIUM WE HAVE THE LEAD BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BOAST YET REPLIED GRACE

5561-41616-0028 THEN WE'LL SEE THAT SHE GOES AWAY IN A GLOOMY FRAME OF MIND SAID NORA FOR WE'RE GOING TO WIN AND DON'T YOU FORGET TO REMEMBER IT
5561-41616-0029 THEN THE SENIORS SCORED TWICE ON FOULS TYING THE SCORE THE JUNIORS SET THEIR TEETH AND WADED IN WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AND MAIN SETTING A WHIRLWIND PACE THAT CAUSED THEIR FANS TO SHOUT WITH WILD ENTHUSIASM AND FAIRLY DAZED THEIR OPPONENTS GRACE ALONE NETTED FOUR FOUL GOALS
5561-41616-0030 AND THE SENSATIONAL PLAYING OF NORA AND MIRIAM WAS A MATTER OF WONDER TO THE SPECTATORS WHO CONCEDED IT TO BE THE FASTEST MOST BRILLIANT HALF EVER PLAYED BY AN OAKDALE TEAM
5561-41616-0031 WHOSE LOYAL SUPPORTERS SWOOPED DOWN UPON THEM THE MOMENT THE WHISTLE BLEW AND PRANCED ABOUT WHOOPING LIKE SAVAGES THAT WAS THE GREATEST GAME I EVER SAW PLAYED UNDER THIS ROOF CRIED DAVID WRINGING GRACE'S HAND WHILE HIPPY HOPPED ABOUT UTTERING LITTLE YELPS OF JOY
5561-41616-0032 REDDY CIRCLED ABOUT THE VICTORS ALMOST TOO DELIGHTED FOR WORDS HE WAS FILLED WITH PROFOUND ADMIRATION FOR THEM THE BOYS CRACK TEAM COULDN'T HAVE PLAYED A BETTER GAME HE SAID SOLEMNLY AND THE GIRLS KNEW THAT HE COULD PAY THEM NO HIGHER COMPLIMENT FOR THIS TEAM WAS CONSIDERED INVINCIBLE BY THE HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
5561-41616-0033 PERHAPS WE'LL CHALLENGE YOU SOME DAY REDDY SAID GRACE MISCHIEVOUSLY I BELIEVE YOU'D WIN AT THAT HE SAID SO EARNESTLY THAT EVERY ONE LAUGHED IT WAS A GREAT TRIUMPH SAID JESSICA PROUDLY AS SHE STOOD WITH MABEL AND ANNE IN THE LOCKER ROOM WHILE THE GIRLS RESUMED STREET CLOTHING AND MY NEW HOWL WAS A SUCCESS TOO
5561-41616-0034 GLAD TO KNOW THAT SAID GRACE THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOISES I COULDN'T DISTINGUISH IT THERE WAS ONE NOISE THAT STARTED THAT WAS PROMPTLY HUSHED SAID ANNE YOU HEARD IT TOO DIDN'T YOU JESSICA OH YES GIRLS I INTENDED TELLING YOU BEFORE THIS REPLIED JESSICA
5561-41616-0035 JUST BEFORE THE LAST HALF STARTED MISS THOMPSON AND MISS KANE CAME IN AND WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE GALLERY WELL ELEANOR AND HER CROWD SAW THEM
5561-41616-0036 HARD TO TELL SAID NORA THEY HISSED MISS THOMPSON VERY SOFTLY YOU MAY BE SURE CONTINUED JESSICA BUT IT WAS HISSING JUST THE SAME
5561-41616-0037 THEY WERE SITTING DOWN FRONT ON THE SAME SIDE AS ELEANOR'S CROWD YOU KNOW WHAT A TEMPER RUTH DEANE HAS AND HOW FEROCIOUS SHE CAN LOOK
5561-41616-0038 SHE TALKED FOR A MOMENT TO EDNA AND ELEANOR THEY TOSSED THEIR HEADS BUT THEY DIDN'T HISS ANY MORE WHAT DID RUTH SAY TO THEM ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY
5561-41615-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN A WOULD BE LARK
5561-41615-0001 THE MAJORITY HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY DELIGHTED OVER WHAT THEY HEARD ONE GROUP STANDING NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF WHICH ELEANOR WAS THE CENTER LAUGHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE SENT TO THEIR SEATS
5561-41615-0002 AND AS THE MORNING ADVANCED THEY BECAME FULLY AWARE THAT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS IN THE WIND SEVERAL TIMES THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FOLDED PAPER BEING STEALTHILY PASSED FROM ONE DESK TO ANOTHER BUT AS TO ITS CONTENTS THEY HAD NO IDEA AS IT WAS NOT HANDED TO ANY ONE OF THEM
5561-41615-0003 AT RECESS THERE WAS MORE GROUPING AND WHISPERING AND GRACE WAS PUZZLED AND NOT A LITTLE HURT OVER THE WAY IN WHICH SHE AND HER FRIENDS WERE IGNORED SUCH A THING HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE BASKETBALL TROUBLE THE PREVIOUS YEAR
5561-41615-0004 ELEANOR STARTED THAT PAPER WHATEVER IT IS SAID NORA O'MALLEY TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WHO STOOD IN A GROUP AROUND HER DESK SHE WAS HERE WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS EARLY TOO IT
5561-41615-0005 HERE COMES MABEL SAID JESSICA MAYBE SHE HAS SEEN THE PAPER
5561-41615-0006 MABEL NODDED WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT MABEL ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY MABEL LOOKED DISTRESSED FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SAID
5561-41615-0007 BUT I GAVE MY WORD OF HONOR BEFORE I READ IT THAT I WOULDN'T MENTION THE CONTENTS TO ANY ONE THEN OF COURSE WE WON'T ASK YOU SAID ANNE PIERSON QUICKLY BUT TELL US THIS MUCH IS IT ABOUT ANY OF US NO REPLIED MABEL IT ISN'T IT IS SOMETHING I WAS ASKED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0008 AND DID YOU SIGN IT ASKED JESSICA I CERTAINLY DID NOT RESPONDED MABEL IT WAS SHE STOPPED THEN FLUSHED
5561-41615-0009 I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE SECRETS AND NOT TELL YOU
5561-41615-0010 WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL IF IT DOESN'T CONCERN US WE DON'T CARE DO WE GIRLS NO INDEED WAS THE REPLY JUST THEN THE BELL SOUNDED AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS WITH THE RIDDLE STILL UNSOLVED
5561-41615-0011 ON WEDNESDAY ASIDE FROM A LITTLE MORE WHISPERING AND SIGNIFICANT GLANCES EXCHANGED AMONG THE PUPILS NOT A RIPPLE DISTURBED THE CALM OF THE STUDY HALL IT WAS THEREFORE A DISTINCT AND NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN MISS THOMPSON WALKED INTO THE ROOM
5561-41615-0012 DISMISSED THE SENIOR CLASS AND REQUESTED THE THREE LOWER CLASSES TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS AFTER THE SENIORS HAD QUIETLY LEFT THE STUDY HALL MISS THOMPSON STOOD GRAVELY REGARDING THE ROWS OF GIRLS BEFORE HER HER EYES WANDERED TOWARD WHERE ELEANOR SAT LOOKING BORED AND INDIFFERENT
5561-41615-0013 AND THEN SHE LOOKED TOWARD GRACE WHOSE STEADY GRAY EYES WERE FIXED ON THE PRINCIPAL'S FACE WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION I DON'T BELIEVE GRACE IS GUILTY AT ANY RATE THOUGHT MISS THOMPSON THEN SHE ADDRESSED THE ASSEMBLED GIRLS SOMETHING HAS COME TO MY EARS GIRLS SAID THE PRINCIPAL
5561-41615-0014 THAT I FIND HARD TO CREDIT BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE HERE THIS AFTERNOON I MUST KNOW WHO IS INNOCENT AND WHO IS GUILTY MISS THOMPSON PAUSED AND A NUMBER OF GIRLS STIRRED UNEASILY IN THEIR SEATS WHILE A FEW GLANCED QUICKLY TOWARD ELEANOR WHO WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD THE PICTURE OF INNOCENCE
5561-41615-0015 THAT IT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FOR ANY PUPIL TO ABSENT HERSELF FROM SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING A CIRCUS MATINEE OR ANY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS NATURE I HAVE SO SEVERELY DISCIPLINED PUPILS FOR THIS OFFENCE THAT FOR A LONG TIME NO ONE HAS DISOBEYED ME
5561-41615-0016 I WAS THEREFORE ASTONISHED TO LEARN THAT A NUMBER OF GIRLS REGARDLESS OF RULES HAVE TAKEN MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND HAVE DECIDED TO ABSENT THEMSELVES FROM SCHOOL TO MORROW IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE MATINEE TO BE GIVEN IN THE THEATRE
5561-41615-0017 SUCH A DECISION IS WORSE THAN DISOBEDIENCE IT IS LAWLESSNESS
5561-41615-0018 THE STANDARD OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE LOWERED THEREFORE I INTEND TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM AND FIND OUT WHAT MISCHIEVOUS INFLUENCE PROMPTED THIS ACT OF INSUBORDINATION REPORT SAYS THAT THIS MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN THE JUNIOR CLASS
5561-41615-0019 AND THAT A PAPER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AND SIGNED BY CERTAIN PUPILS WHO PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PLAY TRUANT AND ATTEND THE MATINEE TO MORROW THE EYES OF GRACE AND HER CHUMS TURNED QUESTIONINGLY TOWARD MABEL ALLISON WHO NODDED SLIGHTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT WAS WHAT ALL THE WHISPERING AND MYSTERY HAD MEANT
5561-41615-0020 GRACE INWARDLY CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON HAVING KEPT CLEAR OF THE WHOLE THING NONE OF HER FRIENDS WERE IMPLICATED EITHER EVEN MABEL HAD REFUSED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0021 WHAT I INSIST UPON KNOWING NOW IS WHO ARE THE REAL CULPRITS BEGINNING WITH THE GIRL WHO ORIGINATED THE PAPER TO THE LAST ONE WHO SIGNED IT
5561-41615-0022 HER EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE GIRLS PRESENT WERE STANDING THE PRINCIPAL STOOD SILENTLY REGARDING THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITTING THAT WILL DO SHE SAID CURTLY
5561-41615-0023 AFTER THEY HAD STOOD FOR WHAT SEEMED TO THEM AN AGE BUT WAS REALLY ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES YOU MAY BE SEATED THE GIRL WHO COMPOSED AND WROTE THAT AGREEMENT WILL NOW RISE AND EXPLAIN HERSELF WITHOUT HESITATING ELEANOR ROSE AND REGARDED THE PRINCIPAL WITH AN INSOLENT SMILE
5561-41615-0024 I WROTE IT MISS THOMPSON SHE SAID CLEARLY I WROTE IT BECAUSE I WISHED TO
5561-41615-0025 BECAUSE IT HAS SPOILED ALL OUR FUN THERE WAS A GASP OF HORROR AT ELEANOR'S ASSERTION NO ONE HAD EVER BEFORE SPOKEN SO DISRESPECTFULLY TO THEIR REVERED PRINCIPAL MISS SAVELL SAID THE PRINCIPAL QUIETLY ALTHOUGH HER FLASHING EYES AND SET LIPS SHOWED THAT SHE WAS VERY ANGRY
5561-41615-0026 IF YOU HAVE THAT PAPER IN YOUR POSSESSION BRING IT TO ME AT ONCE AND NEVER ANSWER ME AGAIN AS YOU DID JUST NOW YOU ARE BOTH DISRESPECTFUL AND IMPERTINENT BUT MISS THOMPSON'S ANGER TOWARD ELEANOR WAS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE TEMPEST THAT THE PRINCIPAL HAD AROUSED IN ELEANOR
5561-41615-0027 THE LATTER FLUSHED THEN TURNED PERFECTLY WHITE WITH RAGE STILL STANDING SHE REACHED DOWN
5561-41615-0028 WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
5561-41615-0029 WITH THESE WORDS ELEANOR ANGRILY FLUNG THE BOOK SHE HELD ON THE DESK AND WALKED DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD THE DOOR BUT MISS THOMPSON BARRED HER WAY STOP MISS SAVELL SHE COMMANDED
5561-41615-0030 I WILL NOT TOLERATE SUCH BEHAVIOR ELEANOR GLARED AT THE PRINCIPAL WHOSE FACE WAS RIGID IN ITS PURPOSE THEN SANK INTO THE NEAREST VACANT SEAT SAYING DEFIANTLY YOU MAY KEEP ME HERE ALL NIGHT IF YOU LIKE
5561-41615-0031 NEVERTHELESS SHE DID NOT AGAIN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE ROOM SHE HAD MET WITH A WILL STRONGER THAN HER OWN AND SHE REALIZED IT IGNORING ELEANOR'S FINAL REMARK MISS THOMPSON ONCE MORE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE MATTER IN HAND
5561-41615-0032 THOSE GIRLS WHO ARE NOT IN ANY WAY IMPLICATED IN THIS MATTER ARE DISMISSED SHE SAID ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE GIRLS AROSE AND PREPARED TO LEAVE THE STUDY HALL THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEING AMONG THE NUMBER
5561-41615-0033 GRACE MOTIONED THE GIRLS TO HURRY SHE WISHED TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH HER FRIENDS BEFORE MISS THOMPSON NOTICED THEM SHE KNEW THE PRINCIPAL WOULD INSIST ON AN APOLOGY FROM ELEANOR AND NEITHER SHE NOR HER FRIENDS WISHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ELEANOR HAD CHOSEN TO CUT THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
5561-41615-0034 GRACE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY WITH HER SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE ELEANOR FOR HAVING ACCUSED HER AND HER FRIENDS OF CARRYING TALES BEFORE ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCHOOL THEREFORE A FORCED APOLOGY WOULD NOT APPEASE HER WOUNDED PRIDE
5561-41615-0035 SHE DREW A BREATH OF RELIEF WHEN THE EIGHT GIRLS WERE SAFELY OUTSIDE THE STUDY HALL DOOR HURRY UP SHE SAID WE'LL TALK WHEN WE GET OUTSIDE SCHOOL DON'T STOP FOR A MINUTE IF MISS THOMPSON NOTICES THAT WE ARE GONE SHE'LL SEND AFTER US
5561-41615-0036 THE GIRLS SILENTLY DONNED THEIR WRAPS AND FLED FROM THE BUILDING LIKE FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ONCE ON THE STREET A LIVELY CONFAB ENSUED ALL TALKING AT ONCE LET'S TAKE TURNS TALKING CRIED GRACE LAUGHING WE SHALL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER
5561-41615-0037 SHE HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN HER TRUE COLORS THIS TIME I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING MORE UNJUST THAN THE WAY SHE ACCUSED US WHEN WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER OLD PLAN SAID MARIAN BARBER IT WAS ABOMINABLE SAID EVA ALLEN THE OTHER GIRLS EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL IN EQUALLY FRANK TERMS
5561-41615-0038 I SUPPOSE IT DID LOOK AS THOUGH I TOLD YOU GIRLS SAID MABEL ALLISON WHO HAD JOINED THEM AT THE GATE YOU KNOW I WAS WITH YOU AT RECESS RIGHT AFTER THE PAPER HAD BEEN PASSED TO ME
5561-41615-0039 IT WAS PASSED TO ME BY MISTAKE VERY LIKELY AGREED GRACE I WONDER WHO DID TELL MISS THOMPSON I SAW SEVERAL GIRLS WITH THE PAPER
5561-41615-0040 THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES CROWD EXCLAIMED NORA THEY ARE ALL IN THIS MIX UP AND IF THEY AREN'T SUSPENDED THEY'LL BE LUCKY
5561-41615-0041 NO SAID GRACE SHORTLY SHE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED THE THINGS SHE SAID TO MISS THOMPSON WERE DISGRACEFUL AND I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR THE WAY SHE SPOKE OF US I WOULDN'T SAY THAT GRACE REMARKED ANNE YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO CHANGE YOUR VIEWS
5561-41615-0042 IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THIS INSTANCE REPLIED GRACE GRIMLY AS SHE BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE REMEMBER GIRLS BASKETBALL PRACTICE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THE REST OF THE WEEK MISS THOMPSON HAS PROMISED ME THE GYMNASIUM PLEASE MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ON HAND
5561-41615-0043 GOOD BYE GRACE CHORUSED HER FRIENDS AND WENT ON DOWN THE STREET DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE FATE OF THE WOULD BE TRUANTS TO RETURN TO THOSE YOUTHFUL TRANSGRESSORS THEY WERE SPENDING A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR WITH MISS THOMPSON SHE WAS MERCILESS IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THEIR CONDUCT
5561-41615-0044 AND THE TERROR OF SUSPENSION AROSE IN MORE THAN ONE MIND AS THEY LISTENED TO HER SCATHING REMARKS
5561-41615-0045 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT NOW WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR THE PRINCIPAL DISMISSED THEM THEY FILED DECOROUSLY OUT VERY UNEASY IN MIND MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN THEIR NAMES BUT HAD NOT STATED THEIR PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE TO FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER DISPLEASURE
5561-41615-0046 WHEN THE LAST GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL TURNED TO ELEANOR
5561-41615-0047 DO YOU INTEND TO OBEY ME MISS SAVELL ASKED MISS THOMPSON STILL THERE WAS NO ANSWER VERY WELL CONTINUED MISS THOMPSON YOUR SILENCE INDICATES THAT YOU ARE STILL INSUBORDINATE YOU MAY THEREFORE CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO THINGS
5561-41615-0048 YOU MAY APOLOGIZE TO ME NOW AND TO MORROW TO THE GIRLS YOU HAVE ACCUSED OF TREACHERY
1447-130551-0000 I AM NOT WITHOUT A LURKING SUSPICION I BEMOANED MY UNLUCKY FATE I COULD ALMOST ALLEGE IT AS A SUPREME EXAMPLE
1447-130551-0001 I WAS EXTREMELY PERPLEXED I WILL PERMIT MYSELF THE LIBERTY OF SAYING I WOULD FAIN BELIEVE

1447-130551-0012 IN SEASONS OF DIFFICULTY AND TRIAL IN SPITE OF PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF IMPERISHABLE BEAUTY
1447-130551-0013 IN THE DIM PROCESSION OF YEARS IN THE HIGHEST CONCEIVABLE DEGREE IN THE LOCAL PHRASE IN THE NATURE OF THINGS

1447-130551-0025 IT DISSIPATES EVERY DOUBT AND SCRUPLE IT ENSLAVES THE IMAGINATION IT EXTORTED FROM HIM EXPRESSIONS OF IRRITABILITY
1447-130551-0026 IT GIVES ONE A LITTLE GRIP AT THE THROAT IT HAS BEEN STIGMATIZED AS IRRELEVANT IT HAS MORE THAN PASSING INTEREST
1447-130551-0027 IT HAS SELDOM BEEN SURPASSED IT IMPOSES NO CONSTRAINT IT IS A CAPITAL BLUNDER IT IS A COMMON ERROR AMONG IGNORANT PEOPLE
1447-130551-0028 IT IS A CONSOLING REFLECTION IT IS A MARK OF GREAT INSTABILITY IT IS A STAGGERING THOUGHT IT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING VICIOUS
1447-130551-0029 IT IS AN ODD JEALOUSY IT IS AN INTOLERABLE IDEA IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST ACKNOWLEDGING THIS
1447-130551-0030 IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN A PLATITUDE IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH ELEVATED AND DIGNIFIED CHARACTER IT IS NOT WHOLLY INSIGNIFICANT
1447-130551-0031 IT IS NOTORIOUSLY EASY TO EXAGGERATE IT IS THE COMMON CONSENT OF MEN IT IS UNNECESSARY TO MULTIPLY INSTANCES
1447-130551-0032 IT MAKES LIFE INSUPPORTABLE IT MUST BE A MATTER OF CONJECTURE IT OCCASIONS SUSPICION AND DISCONTENT
1447-130551-0033 IT RUNS COUNTER TO ALL ESTABLISHED CUSTOMS IT WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IT WEARS A RAGGED AND DANGEROUS FRONT
1447-130551-0034 IT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS TO SAY IT WOULD NOT SEEM AN IMPROBABLE CONCLUSION
1447-17506-0000 CHAPTER NINE COUNT FERRALTI
1447-17506-0001 AT DINNER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FAMOUS TARANTELLA WOULD BE DANCED IN THE LOWER HALL OF THE HOTEL AT NINE O'CLOCK AND THE GIRLS TOLD UNCLE JOHN THAT THEY MUST NOT MISS THIS FAMOUS SIGHT WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE IN SORRENTO OR INDEED IN ALL ITALY
1447-17506-0002 AS THEY ENTERED THE PRETTY CIRCULAR HALL DEVOTED TO THE DANCE LOUISE GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
1447-17506-0003 A GOODLY AUDIENCE HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE ROOM AND AMONG THEM THE GIRL SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE AN ACQUAINTANCE FOR AFTER A BRIEF HESITATION SHE ADVANCED AND PLACED HER HAND IN THAT OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD RISEN ON HER ENTRANCE AND HASTENED TOWARD HER
1447-17506-0004 HE WAS A NICE LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW BETH THOUGHT AND HAD A FOREIGN AND QUITE DISTINGUISHED AIR PRESENTLY LOUISE TURNED WITH CHEEKS SOMEWHAT FLUSHED AND BROUGHT THE GENTLEMAN TO HER PARTY
1447-17506-0005 INTRODUCING HIM TO UNCLE JOHN AND HER COUSINS AS COUNT FERRALTI WHOM SHE HAD ONCE MET IN NEW YORK WHILE HE WAS ON A VISIT TO AMERICA
1447-17506-0006 THE COUNT TWIRLED HIS SMALL AND SLENDER MOUSTACHES IN A WAY THAT PATSY THOUGHT AFFECTED AND SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH
1447-17506-0007 NEW YORK ADOPTS A GOOD MANY SAID UNCLE JOHN DRILY IT HAS EVEN BEEN THOUGHTLESS ENOUGH TO ADOPT ME THE DANCERS ENTERED AT THAT MOMENT AND THE AMERICANS WERE FORCED TO SEAT THEMSELVES HASTILY SO AS NOT TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OF OTHERS
1447-17506-0008 COUNT FERRALTI FOUND A PLACE BESIDE LOUISE BUT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE TO SAY TO HER DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT THE DANCES WERE UNIQUE AND GRACEFUL BEING EXECUTED BY A TROUP OF LAUGHING PEASANTS DRESSED IN NATIVE COSTUME
1447-17506-0009 WHO SEEMED VERY PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ANXIOUS TO PLEASE THE THRONG OF TOURISTS PRESENT THE TARANTELLA ORIGINATED IN ISCHIA BUT SORRENTO AND CAPRI HAVE THE BEST DANCERS
1447-17506-0010 AFTERWARD UNCLE JOHN AND HIS NIECES STOOD UPON THE TERRACE AND WATCHED THE VOLCANO ROLLING ITS DENSE CLOUDS MINGLED WITH SPARKS OF RED HOT SCORIA TOWARD THE SKY
1447-17506-0011 THE COUNT CLUNG TO LOUISE'S SIDE BUT ALSO TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HER COUSINS
1447-17506-0012 AND BETH REPLIED THAT HIS MANNERS WERE SO LIKE THOSE OF THEIR COUSIN LOUISE THAT THE TWO OUGHT TO GET ALONG NICELY TOGETHER UNCLE JOHN LIKED HIS NIECES TO MAKE FRIENDS AND ENCOURAGED YOUNG MEN GENERALLY TO MEET THEM
1447-17506-0013 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS CALLOW ITALIAN NOBLEMAN THAT STAMPED HIS CHARACTER AS ARTIFICIAL AND INSINCERE HE RESOLVED TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS ANTECEDENTS BEFORE HE PERMITTED THE YOUNG FELLOW
1447-17506-0014 TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH HIS GIRLS NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HE WANDERED THROUGH THE LOBBY AND PAUSED AT THE LITTLE OFFICE WHERE HE DISCOVERED THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS HOTEL WAS A BROTHER OF THAT FLORIANO WHO MANAGED THE HOTEL DU VESUVE
1447-17506-0015 THAT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO TALK WITH THE MAN WHO SPOKE VERY GOOD ENGLISH AND WAS EXCEEDINGLY COURTEOUS TO HIS GUESTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE AMERICAN
1447-17506-0016 COUNT FERRALTI THE YOUNG MAN STANDING BY THE WINDOW YONDER I I DID NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY THE GENTLEMAN ARRIVED LAST EVENING AND I HAD NOT YET LEARNED HIS NAME LET ME SEE
1447-17506-0017 HE TURNED TO HIS LIST OF GUESTS WHO REGISTER BY CARD AND NOT IN A BOOK AND CONTINUED
1447-17506-0018 HE HAS GIVEN HIS NAME AS FERRALTI BUT ADDED NO TITLE A COUNT DID YOU SAY YES REPLIED UNCLE JOHN THE PROPRIETOR LOOKED CURIOUSLY TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE BACK ONLY WAS VISIBLE
1447-17506-0019 THEN HE REMARKED THAT THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS WAS WANING AND THE TROUBLE NEARLY OVER FOR THIS TIME
1447-17506-0020 THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU SIGNOR MERRICK OH PERHAPS YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF YOUR COUNTRY I I KNOW LITTLE OF THE NOBILITY ANSWERED FLORIANO INDIGNANTLY
1447-17506-0021 MY DEAR SIGNOR THERE IS NO MAN BETTER POSTED AS TO OUR NOBILITY IN ALL ITALY YET YOU SAY YOU DON'T KNOW THE FERRALTI FAMILY
1447-17506-0022 OBSERVE SIGNOR HERE IS OUR RECORD OF NOBILITY IT IS THE SAME AS THE BLUE BOOK OR THE PEERAGE OF ENGLAND EITHER FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SAY YOU HAVE NO NEED OF SUCH A BOOK IN AMERICA
1447-17506-0023 HE TURNED THE PAGES AND RAN HIS FINGER DOWN THE LINE OF FS FIND ME IF YOU CAN A COUNT FERRALTI IN THE LIST UNCLE JOHN LOOKED HE PUT ON HIS GLASSES AND LOOKED AGAIN
1447-17506-0024 AND NO SUCH NOBLE FAMILY SIGNOR MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WHISTLED SOFTLY AND WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW THE YOUNG MAN GREETED HIM WITH A SMILE AND A BOW I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR NAME LAST EVENING HE SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE COUNT FERRALTI
1447-17506-0025 AND THAT IS RIGHT SIR WAS THE PROMPT REPLY ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU MY CARD UNCLE JOHN TOOK THE CARD AND READ CONTE LEONARDI FERRALTI MILANO ITALIA
1447-17506-0026 HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE CARD IN HIS POCKET BOOK THANK YOU SAID HE IT'S A FINE MORNING COUNT CHARMING MISTER MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WALKED AWAY HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT SUSPECTED THE YOUNG MAN UNJUSTLY
1447-17506-0027 WHEN AN IMPOSTURE IS UNMASKED IT IS NO LONGER DANGEROUS HE JOINED HIS NIECES WHO WERE ALL BUSILY ENGAGED IN WRITING LETTERS HOME AND REMARKED CASUALLY YOU'VE BEEN DECEIVED IN YOUR ITALIAN FRIEND LOUISE
1447-17506-0028 HE IS NEITHER A COUNT NOR OF NOBLE FAMILY ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU MET HIM IN NEW YORK HE HAD AN OBJECT IN POSING AS A TITLED ARISTOCRAT THE GIRL PAUSED EXAMINING THE POINT OF HER PEN THOUGHTFULLY
1447-17506-0029 HAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF HIM HOW SINGULAR EXCLAIMED LOUISE I WONDER WHY HE HAS TRIED TO DECEIVE US OH THE WORLD IS FULL OF IMPOSTORS BUT WHEN YOU ARE ON TO THEIR GAME THEY ARE QUITE HARMLESS
1447-17506-0030 UNCLE JOHN HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY FURTHER HE FELT HE WAS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION FOR LOUISE WAS THE MOST EXPERIENCED IN WORLDLY WAYS OF HIS THREE NIECES AND HE HAD NO DESIRE TO POSE AS A STERN GUARDIAN
1447-17506-0031 OR TO DEPRIVE HIS GIRLS OF ANY PASSING PLEASURE THEY MIGHT ENJOY MOREOVER LOUISE BEING IN LOVE WITH THAT YOUNG WELDON HER MOTHER SO STRONGLY OBJECTED TO
1447-17506-0032 SHE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO CARE MUCH FOR THIS ITALIAN FELLOW AND MISSUS MERRICK HAD ENJOINED HIM TO KEEP HER DAUGHTER'S MIND FROM DWELLING ON HER ENTANGLEMENT OH WELL MY DEAR HE SAID TO HER YOU MUST ACT AS YOU SEE FIT
1447-17506-0033 I DO NOT IMAGINE WE SHALL SEE MUCH OF THIS YOUNG MAN IN ANY EVENT AND NOW THAT YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HE IS SAILING UNDER FALSE COLORS YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIM BETTER THAN I CAN ADVISE YOU

118-47824-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
118-47824-0001 I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
118-47824-0002 ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
118-47824-0003 THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
118-47824-0004 AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
118-47824-0005 HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
118-47824-0006 PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN
118-47824-0007 THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
118-47824-0008 DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
118-47824-0009 IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
118-47824-0010 I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
118-47824-0011 GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
118-47824-0012 BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
118-47824-0013 HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
118-47824-0014 WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
118-47824-0015 THE MANAGER TOOK MY ADVICE BUT MARIA'S STILL MISSING
118-47824-0016 HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
118-47824-0017 BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
118-47824-0018 HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
118-47824-0019 THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
118-47824-0020 OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
118-47824-0021 FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
118-47824-0022 YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
118-47824-0023 GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
118-47824-0024 LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
118-47824-0025 BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
118-47824-0026 PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
118-47824-0027 WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0028 COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
118-47824-0029 AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
118-47824-0030 GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
118-47824-0031 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
118-47824-0033 SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
118-47824-0036 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
118-47824-0039 ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
118-47824-0042 THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
118-47824-0048 BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
118-47824-0051 FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
118-47824-0054 AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
118-47824-0057 HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
118-47824-0060 SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
118-47824-0063 IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
118-47824-0064 HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
118-47824-0065 HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
118-47824-0066 GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
118-47824-0068 I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
118-47824-0069 ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
118-47824-0070 NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
118-47824-0071 MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
118-47824-0072 AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
118-47824-0073 BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
118-47824-0074 IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
118-47824-0075 HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
118-47824-0076 FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
118-47824-0077 YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
118-47824-0078 THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
118-47824-0079 HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
118-47824-0080 FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
118-47824-0081 BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
118-47824-0082 GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
118-47824-0083 BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
118-47824-0084 SCRATCHED AND WITH BROKEN HANDLES THE CLOSED COLONIAL DESK THE MISERLY RAG CARPET ALL SEEMED MUTELY ASKING AS BOBBY DID
118-47824-0085 FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS TWO CANDLES THE ONLY LIGHT
118-47824-0086 SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THE LIVING MET THE DEAD AND THE LAW WATCHED HOPEFULLY
118-124588-0000 MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
118-124588-0001 NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
118-124588-0002 BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
118-124588-0003 SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
118-124588-0004 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
118-124588-0005 AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
118-124588-0006 PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
118-124588-0007 OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
118-124588-0008 BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
118-124588-0009 FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
118-124588-0010 THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
118-124588-0011 AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
118-124588-0012 AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
118-124588-0013 BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
118-124588-0014 THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
118-124588-0015 IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0016 THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0017 LAPIERRE GAVE UP ALL HIS TIME TO THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE ROYAL OAK TO THE CARE OF ITS LANDLADY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
118-124588-0018 WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
118-124588-0019 FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
118-124588-0020 DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
118-124588-0021 ADVERTISEMENTS SETTING FORTH THE MAIN FACTS WERE INSERTED IN THE PRINCIPAL NEWSPAPERS OF TORONTO HAMILTON AND LONDON

5104-33407-0005 FOR A WHILE HE WALKED THE LAND AS THOUGH HE WERE IN A DREAM HE LOOKED AT THIS AND THAT AND EVERYTHING
5104-33407-0006 I WILL GO TO THE KING HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN A KING THERE WERE NO KINGS IN ICELAND OR IN GREENLAND SO HE WENT TO THE CITY WHERE THE KING HAD HIS FINE HOUSE THE KING'S NAME WAS OLAF
5104-33407-0007 HE WAS A GREAT GRANDSON OF HARALD HAIRFAIR FOR HARALD HAD BEEN DEAD A HUNDRED YEARS NOW THE KING WAS GOING TO HOLD A FEAST AT NIGHT AND LEIF PUT ON HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES TO GO TO IT

5104-33407-0009 LINED WITH SEAL FUR HIS LONG SWORD STUCK OUT FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK ON HIS HEAD HE PUT A KNITTED CAP OF BRIGHT COLORS THEN HE WALKED TO THE KING'S FEAST HALL AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR
5104-33407-0010 IT WAS A GREAT HALL AND IT WAS FULL OF RICHLY DRESSED MEN THE FIRES SHONE ON SO MANY GOLDEN HEAD BANDS AND BRACELETS AND SO MANY GLITTERING SWORDS AND SPEARS ON THE WALL AND THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE OF TALKING AND LAUGHING
5104-33407-0011 THAT AT FIRST LEIF DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT AT LAST HE WENT AND SAT ON THE VERY END SEAT OF THE BENCH NEAR HIM AS THE FEAST WENT ON KING OLAF SAT IN HIS HIGH SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT THE HALL AND NOTICED THIS ONE AND THAT ONE AND SPOKE ACROSS THE FIRE TO MANY
5104-33407-0012 HE WAS KEEN EYED AND SOON SAW LEIF IN HIS FAR SEAT YONDER IS SOME MAN OF MARK HE SAID TO HIMSELF HE IS SURELY WORTH KNOWING HIS FACE IS NOT THE FACE OF A FOOL
5104-33407-0013 HE CARRIES HIS HEAD LIKE A LORD OF MEN HE SENT A THRALL AND ASKED LEIF TO COME TO HIM SO LEIF WALKED DOWN THE LONG HALL AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU FOR A GUEST THE KING SAID

5104-33407-0015 MANY COME TO NORWAY TO TRADE BUT THEY SELDOM COME TO THE KING'S HALL I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR LAND COME UP AND SPEAK WITH ME SO LEIF WENT UP THE STEPS OF THE HIGH SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY THE KING AND TALKED WITH HIM
5104-33407-0016 WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER THE KING SAID YOU SHALL LIVE AT MY COURT THIS WINTER LEIF ERICSSON YOU ARE A WELCOME GUEST SO LEIF STAYED THERE THAT WINTER WHEN HE STARTED BACK IN THE SPRING
5104-33407-0017 THE KING GAVE HIM TWO THRALLS AS A PARTING GIFT LET THIS GIFT SHOW MY LOVE LEIF ERICSSON HE SAID FOR YOUR SAKE I SHALL NOT FORGET GREENLAND LEIF SAILED BACK AGAIN AND HAD GOOD LUCK UNTIL HE WAS PAST ICELAND
5104-33407-0018 THEN GREAT WINDS CAME OUT OF THE NORTH AND TOSSED HIS SHIP ABOUT SO THAT THE MEN COULD DO NOTHING THEY WERE BLOWN SOUTH FOR DAYS AND DAYS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE THEN THEY SAW LAND AND LEIF SAID
5104-33407-0019 SURELY LUCK HAS BROUGHT US ALSO TO A NEW COUNTRY
5104-33407-0020 SO HE STEERED FOR IT AS THEY CAME NEAR THE MEN SAID SEE THE GREAT TREES AND THE SOFT GREEN SHORE SURELY THIS IS A BETTER COUNTRY THAN GREENLAND OR THAN ICELAND EITHER
5104-33407-0021 WHEN THEY LANDED THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND I NEVER LAY ON A BED SO SOFT AS THIS GRASS ONE SAID TALLER TREES DO NOT GROW IN NORWAY SAID ANOTHER
5104-33407-0022 THERE IS NO STONE HERE AS IN NORWAY BUT ONLY GOOD BLACK DIRT LEIF SAID I NEVER SAW SO FERTILE A LAND BEFORE THE MEN WERE HUNGRY AND SET ABOUT BUILDING A FIRE THERE IS NO LACK OF FUEL HERE
5104-33407-0023 THEY SAID THEY STAYED MANY DAYS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WALKED ABOUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE A GERMAN NAMED TYRKER WAS WITH LEIF HE WAS A LITTLE MAN WITH A HIGH FOREHEAD AND A SHORT NOSE HIS EYES WERE BIG AND ROLLING
5104-33407-0024 HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY SO LEIF LOVED HIM NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
5104-33407-0025 WHERE IS TYRKER NO ONE KNEW THEN LEIF WAS ANGRY IS A MAN OF SO LITTLE VALUE IN THIS EMPTY LAND THAT YOU WOULD LOSE ONE HE SAID WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP TOGETHER DID YOU NOT SEE THAT HE WAS GONE
5104-33407-0026 WHY DID YOU NOT SET OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM WHO KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM IN THESE GREAT FORESTS THEN HE TURNED AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR HIM HIS MEN FOLLOWED SILENT AND ASHAMED
5104-33407-0027 AGAIN LEIF ASKED HIS QUESTION AND PUT HIS HAND ON TYRKER'S SHOULDER AS THOUGH HE WOULD SHAKE HIM THEN TYRKER ANSWERED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ICELAND I HAVE NOT BEEN SO VERY FAR BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WONDERFUL WHAT IS IT
5104-33407-0028 CRIED THE MEN I HAVE FOUND GRAPES GROWING WILD ANSWERED TYRKER AND HE LAUGHED AND HIS EYES SHONE IT CANNOT BE LEIF SAID GRAPES DO NOT GROW IN GREENLAND NOR IN ICELAND NOR EVEN IN NORWAY
5104-33407-0029 SO IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING TO THESE NORSEMEN CAN I NOT TELL GRAPES WHEN I SEE THEM CRIED TYRKER DID I NOT GROW UP IN GERMANY WHERE EVERY HILLSIDE IS COVERED WITH GRAPEVINES AH IT SEEMS LIKE MY OLD HOME
5104-33407-0030 IT IS WONDERFUL LEIF SAID I HAVE HEARD TRAVELERS TELL OF SEEING GRAPES GROWING BUT I MYSELF NEVER SAW IT YOU SHALL TAKE US TO THEM EARLY IN THE MORNING TYRKER SO IN THE MORNING THEY WENT BACK INTO THE WOODS AND SAW THE GRAPES
5104-33407-0031 THEY ATE OF THEM THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED THAT DAY LEIF SAID WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN WE MUST START BACK
5104-33407-0032 WE WILL FILL THE ROWBOAT WITH GRAPES AND TOW IT BEHIND US THE SHIP WE WILL LOAD WITH LOGS FROM THESE GREAT TREES THAT WILL BE A WELCOME SHIPLOAD IN GREENLAND WHERE WE HAVE NEITHER TREES NOR VINES
5104-33407-0033 NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
5104-33407-0034 AS THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE SHORE LEIF SAID I WILL CALL THIS COUNTRY WINELAND FOR THE GRAPES THAT GROW THERE ONE OF THE MEN LEAPED UPON THE GUNWALE AND LEANED OUT CLINGING TO THE SAIL AND SANG
5104-33407-0035 WINELAND THE GREEN THE GREAT THE FAT OUR DRAGON FED AND CRAWLS AWAY WITH BELLY STUFFED AND LAZY FEET HOW LONG HER PURPLE TRAILING TAIL SHE FED AND GREW TO TWICE HER SIZE
5104-33407-0036 THEN ALL THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE SHORE AND GAVE A GREAT SHOUT FOR THAT GOOD LAND FOR ALL THAT VOYAGE THEY HAD FAIR WEATHER AND SAILED INTO ERIC'S HARBOR BEFORE THE WINTER CAME
5104-33407-0037 ERIC SAW THE SHIP AND RAN DOWN TO THE SHORE HE TOOK LEIF INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID OH MY SON MY OLD EYES ACHED TO SEE YOU I HUNGER TO HEAR OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE
5104-33407-0038 LUCK HAS FOLLOWED ME ALL THE WAY SAID LEIF SEE WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT HOME THE GREENLANDERS LOOKED LUMBER LUMBER THEY CRIED OH IT IS BETTER STUFF THAN GOLD
5104-33407-0039 THEN THEY SAW THE GRAPES AND TASTED THEM SURELY YOU MUST HAVE PLUNDERED ASGARD THEY SAID SMACKING THEIR LIPS AT THE FEAST THAT NIGHT ERIC SAID LEIF SHALL SIT IN THE PLACE OF HONOR
5104-33407-0040 SO LEIF SAT IN THE HIGH SEAT OPPOSITE ERIC ALL MEN THOUGHT HIM A HANDSOME AND WISE MAN HE TOLD THEM OF THE STORM AND OF WINELAND NO MAN WOULD EVER NEED A CLOAK THERE THE SOIL IS RICHER THAN THE SOIL OF NORWAY
5104-33407-0041 GRAIN GROWS WILD AND YOU YOURSELVES SAW THE GRAPES THAT WE GOT FROM THERE THE FORESTS ARE WITHOUT END THE SEA IS FULL OF FISH THE GREENLANDERS LISTENED WITH OPEN MOUTHS TO ALL THIS
5104-33407-0042 LEIF NOTICED TWO STRANGERS AN OLD MAN WHO SAT AT ERIC'S SIDE AND A YOUNG WOMAN ON THE CROSS BENCH HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER THORSTEIN WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM WHO ARE THESE STRANGERS HE ASKED
5104-33407-0043 THORBIORN AND HIS DAUGHTER GUDRID THORSTEIN ANSWERED THEY LANDED HERE THIS SPRING I NEVER SAW OUR FATHER MORE GLAD OF ANYTHING THAN TO SEE THIS THORBIORN THEY WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE LEFT ICELAND
5104-33407-0044 WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN THEY COULD NOT TALK ENOUGH OF OLD TIMES IN THE SPRING ERIC MEANS TO GIVE HIM A FARM UP THE FIORD A WAY IT SEEMS THAT THIS THORBIORN COMES OF A GOOD FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN RICH AND GREAT IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
5104-33407-0045 AND THORBIORN HIMSELF WAS RICH WHEN OUR FATHER KNEW HIM AND WAS MUCH HONORED BY ALL MEN BUT ILL LUCK CAME AND HE GREW POOR THIS HURT HIS PRIDE I WILL NOT STAY IN ICELAND AND BE A BEGGAR
5104-33407-0046 HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT HAVE MEN LOOK AT ME AND SAY HE IS NOT WHAT HIS FATHER WAS I WILL GO TO MY FRIEND ERIC THE RED IN GREENLAND THEN HE GOT READY A GREAT FEAST AND INVITED ALL HIS FRIENDS
5104-33407-0047 IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST
5104-33407-0048 AFTER THAT HE SET OUT AND CAME TO GREENLAND IS NOT GUDRID BEAUTIFUL AND SHE IS WISE I MEAN TO MARRY HER IF HER FATHER WILL PERMIT IT
5104-33407-0049 NOW LEIF SETTLED DOWN IN GREENLAND AND BECAME A GREAT MAN THERE HE WAS SO BUSY AND HE GREW SO RICH THAT HE DID NOT THINK OF GOING TO WINELAND AGAIN BUT PEOPLE COULD NOT FORGET HIS STORY
5703-47212-0000 WITH HER WHITE PAINT AND HER SCARLET SMOKESTACK THE INVERASHIEL ONE OF THE TWO SMALL STEAMERS THAT DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS PLIED UP AND DOWN THE LOCH AND INCIDENTALLY CARRIED ON COMMUNICATION BETWEEN INVERASHIEL AND CRIANAN
5703-47212-0001 WAS A PICTURESQUE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE AS SHE APPROACHED THE WOODEN LANDING STAGE THAT STOOD HALF A MILE BELOW THE PROMONTORY ON WHICH THE CASTLE WAS BUILT IT WAS THE MORNING OF FRIDAY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
5703-47212-0002 IN SPITE OF THE BRILLIANT SUNSET OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING THE LOCH LAY DARK AND STILL ITS SURFACE WORE AN OILY TREACHEROUS LOOK EVERY DETAIL OF THE INVERASHIEL'S TUB LIKE SHAPE WAS REFLECTED AND BEAUTIFULLY DISTORTED IN THE WATER
5703-47212-0003 AS THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WERE WAITING FOR HER CROSSED THE SHORT GANGWAY A SHOWER BURST OVER THE LOCH AND IN A FEW MINUTES HAD DRIVEN EVERY ONE INTO THE LITTLE CABIN EXCEPT THE TWO OR THREE MEN WHO CONSTITUTED THE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE STEAMER
5703-47212-0004 ONE OF THESE WAS IN THE ACT OF SLACKENING THE ROPE BY WHICH THE BOAT HAD BEEN WARPED ALONGSIDE WHEN A RUNNING GESTICULATING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE SHOUTING TO THEM TO WAIT FOR HIM WAITED FOR ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AND IN A FEW MINUTES GIMBLET
5703-47212-0005 RATHER OUT OF BREATH AFTER HIS RUN HURRIED ON BOARD AND WITH A WORD OF APOLOGY AND THANKS TO THE OBLIGING SKIPPER TURNED LIKE THE OTHER PASSENGERS TOWARDS THE SHELTER OF THE CABIN WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR HE HESITATED
5703-47212-0006 THROUGH THE GLASS TOP HE HAD JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FIGURE THAT SEEMED FAMILIAR HE HAD SEEN THAT TWEED BEFORE THE SHORT GIRL WITH HER BACK TO HIM WAS WEARING THE DRESS IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER ON THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
5703-47212-0007 SEARCHING AMONG LORD ASHIEL'S PAPERS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE CASTLE IT WAS JULIA ROMANINOV BEYOND A DOUBT AND GIMBLET DREW BACK QUICKLY AND TOOK UP HIS POSITION BEHIND THE FUNNELS ON THE AFTER DECK
5703-47212-0008 IN SPITE OF THE RAIN HE REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE BOAT REACHED CRIANAN LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL WITH HIS COLLAR TURNED UP AND HIS SOFT FELT HAT PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EARS SO THAT LITTLE OF HIM WAS VISIBLE EXCEPT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE
5703-47212-0009 HIS MIND ALWAYS ACTIVE WAS BUSIER THAN USUAL AS HE WATCHED THE RIPPLES ROLL AWAY IN ENDLESS SUCCESSION FROM THE SIDES OF THE INVERASHIEL WHICH LOOKED SO STRANGELY LESS WHITE ON CLOSER INSPECTION
5703-47212-0010 OR FOLLOWED THE SMOOTH SOARING MOVEMENTS OF THE GULLS THAT SWOOPED AND CIRCLED AROUND HER
5703-47212-0011 AS THEY DREW NEAR TO CRIANAN HE CONCEALED HIMSELF STILL MORE CAREFULLY BEHIND A PILE OF CRATES AND NOT TILL MISS ROMANINOV HAD LEFT THE STEAMER DID HE EMERGE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND STEP WARILY OFF THE BOAT
5703-47212-0012 THE YOUNG LADY WAS STILL IN SIGHT MAKING HER WAY UP THE STEEP PITCH OF THE MAIN STREET AND THE DETECTIVE FOLLOWED HER DISCREETLY LOITERING BEFORE SHOP WINDOWS AS IF FASCINATED BY THE DISPLAY OF SCOTTISH HOMESPUNS
5703-47212-0013 OR SAMPLES OF ROYAL STEWART TARTAN AND TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN FISHING TACKLE AND TROUT FLIES BUT THOUGH THE GIRL LOOKED BACK MORE THAN ONCE THE LITTLE MAN IN THE ULSTER WHO WAS SO INTENT ON PICKING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE PUDDLES
5703-47212-0014 DID NOT APPARENTLY PROVIDE HER WITH ANY FOOD FOR SUSPICION AND SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHO WAS SO CAREFULLY SHELTERED BENEATH THE UMBRELLA HE CARRIED AT LAST THEY LEFT THE COBBLE STONES OF THE LITTLE TOWN AND EMERGED UPON THE HIGH ROAD
5703-47212-0015 WHICH HERE RAN ACROSS THE OPEN MOORLAND IT WAS DIFFICULT NOW TO CONTINUE THE PURSUIT UNOBSERVED AND GIMBLET BECAME ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN ENORMOUS CAIRNGORM
5703-47212-0016 WHICH WAS MASQUERADING AS AN ARTICLE OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LAST OUTLYING SHOP FROM THIS POSITION NOT WITHOUT ITS EMBARRASSMENTS SINCE A COUPLE OF BAREFOOTED CHILDREN CAME INSTANTLY TO THE DOOR WHERE THEY STOOD AND STARED AT HIM UNBLINKINGLY
5703-47212-0017 HE SAW THE RUSSIAN ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS THE MOOR AND LOOK WHERE HE WOULD COULD PERCEIVE NO MEANS OF KEEPING UP WITH HER UNOBSERVED UPON THE BARE SIDE OF THE HILL JUST AS HE DECIDED THAT THE DISTANCE SEPARATING THEM HAD INCREASED TO AN EXTENT
5703-47212-0018 WHICH WARRANTED HIS CONTINUING THE CHASE HE JOYFULLY SAW HER SLACKEN HER PACE AND AT THE SAME MOMENT A MAN WHO MUST HAVE BEEN SITTING BEHIND A BOULDER BESIDE THE ROAD ROSE TO HIS FEET OUT OF THE HEATHER AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HER
5703-47212-0019 FOR TEN LONG MINUTES THEY STOOD TALKING DRIVING POOR GIMBLET TO THE DESPERATE EXPEDIENT OF ENTERING THE SHOP AND DEMANDING A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CAIRNGORM IT IS HUMILIATING TO RELATE THAT HE RECOILED BEFORE IT WHEN IT WAS PLACED IN HIS HAND
5703-47212-0020 AND NEARLY FLED AGAIN INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND HELD THE PROUD PROPRIETRESS A GAUNT GREY HAIRED WOMAN WITH KNITTING NEEDLES EVER CLICKING IN HER DEXTEROUS HANDS
5703-47212-0021 IN CONVERSATION UPON THE THEME OF ITS UNIQUE BEAUTIES UNTIL THE SUBJECT WAS EXHAUSTED TO THE POINT OF COLLAPSE EVERY OTHER MINUTE HE MUST STROLL TO THE DOOR AND TAKE A LOOK UP AND DOWN THE ROAD A FRIEND HE EXPLAINED HAD PROMISED TO MEET HIM IN THAT PLACE
5703-47212-0022 AND THOUGH THE SHOPWOMAN PLAINLY DOUBTED HIS VERACITY AND KEPT A SHARP EYE THAT HE DID NOT TAKE TO HIS HEELS WITH THE CAIRNGORM SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST HIS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THE ZONE OF TEMPTATION
5703-47212-0023 AT LAST WHEN FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE PUT HIS NOSE ROUND THE DOORPOST HE SAW THAT THE PAIR HAD SEPARATED AND WERE WALKING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE GIRL CONTINUING ON HER WAY WHILE THE MAN RETURNED TO THE TOWN
5703-47212-0024 HE WAS INDEED NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OFF GIMBLET PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE SHOP AND FASTENED UPON SOME PENCILS WITH A ZEAL NOT VERY CONVINCING AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING VACILLATION OVER THE BROOCH
5703-47212-0025 WHICH SHE PRESSED UPON HIM AS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO HIS NEEDS AND CHARGED HIM FOURPENCE FOR BY THE TIME HE ISSUED FORTH INTO THE OPEN AIR HIS POCKETS FULL OF PACKAGES THE STRANGER HAD PASSED THE SHOP AND WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF THE NEXT HOUSE
5703-47212-0026 TO HIM NOW GIMBLET DEVOTED HIS POWERS OF SHADOWING THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT THE MAN WALKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT
5703-47212-0027 NARROW POINTED FOOTPRINTS THAT WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED IN THE MUDDY PLACES HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE SAME AS THOSE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE BEACH ON THE DAY OF HIS ARRIVAL AT INVERASHIEL
5703-47212-0028 THE STRANGER TURNED INTO THE CRIANAN HOTEL WHICH STANDS ON THE LAKE FRONT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE LANDING PLACE OF THE LOCH STEAMERS GIMBLET PASSED THE DOOR WITHOUT PAUSING AND WENT DOWN TO THE LOCH WHERE HE MINGLED WITH THE BOATMEN AND LOAFERS WHO CONGREGATED BY THE WATERSIDE
5703-47212-0029 HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
5703-47212-0030 BUT NOW HE HAD A GOOD LOOK AS HE PASSED CLOSE BESIDE HIM HE WAS A TALL FAIR MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER BUT WITH NOTHING VERY STRIKING ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE A POINTED YELLOW BEARD HID THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE
5703-47212-0031 AND FOR THE REST HIS NOSE WAS SHORT HIS EYES BLUE AND CLOSE TOGETHER AND HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND NARROW HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT GIMBLET AS HE WENT BY AND FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN MET
5703-47212-0032 BOTH EQUALLY INSCRUTABLE AND UNFLINCHING THEN THE STRANGER GLANCED ASIDE AND STRODE ON TO WHERE A SMALL BOAT LAY MOORED THE DETECTIVE TURNED HIS BACK WHILE THE FAIR MAN GOT IN AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE LOCH GENTLEMAN GOING FISHING
5703-47212-0033 HE'S AXTRA FOND O THE FEESHIN WAS THE REPLY FOR A THAT HE'S A FOREIGN SHENTLEMAN WAITING TILL THE BOAT HAD BECOME A DISTANT SPECK ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS GIMBLET MADE HIS WAY INTO THE INN AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE LANDLORD
5703-47212-0034 ON THE PRETEXT OF ENGAGING ROOMS FOR A FRIEND THE LANDLORD WAS SORRY BUT THE HOUSE WAS FULL
5703-47212-0035 FOLKS TAK THEIR ROOMS A MONTH IN ADVANCE THEY COME HERE FOR THE FISHIN ON THE LOCH
5703-47212-0036 INDEED I CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT GIMBLET ASSURED HIM I SUPPOSE YOU GET A LOT OF TOURISTS PASSING THROUGH THOUGH AMERICANS FOR INSTANCE
5703-47212-0037 I SELDOM HAE AN AMERICAN BIDIN HERE THEY MAISTLY GANG DOON THE LOCH SAID THE INNKEEPER I THOUGHT SAID GIMBLET THAT WAS A FOREIGN LOOKING MAN WHOM I SAW A LITTLE WHILE AGO COMING OUT OF THE HOTEL

5703-47212-0040 DEAR ME SAID GIMBLET JUST WHAT MY FRIEND WANTS I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM IN I MUST TELL HIM TO WRITE IN GOOD TIME NEXT YEAR IF HE WANTS A ROOM AS HE PARTED FROM THE LANDLORD UPON THE DOORSTEP OF THE CRIANAN HOTEL THE ROB ROY
5703-47212-0041 THE SECOND OF THE TWO LOCH STEAMERS WAS EDGING AWAY FROM THE PIER UNDER A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE FROM HER FUNNEL THE RAIN HAD STOPPED THE PASSENGERS WERE SCATTERED ON THE DECK
5703-47212-0042 AND IN THE BOWS OF THE VESSEL THE DETECTIVE CAUGHT SIGHT OF JULIA ROMANINOV'S TWEED CLAD FORM SHE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL AND GAZING AT A DISTANT PART OF THE LOCH WHERE A BLACK SPECK
5703-47212-0043 IT WAS AS GIMBLET HAD EXPECTED AND THOUGH HE CHAFED AT THE DELAY HE REGRETTED LESS THAN HE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE THAT HE COULD NOT CATCH THE ROB ROY THE INVERASHIEL WOULD BE DUE ON HER HOMEWARD TRIP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIME
5703-47212-0044 AND MEANWHILE HE HAD OTHER BUSINESS THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO HE WENT FIRST TO THE POST OFFICE WHERE HE REGISTERED AND POSTED TO SCOTLAND YARD A PACKET HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN AFTER ASKING HIS WAY OF THE SOCIABLE LANDLORD OF THE HOTEL
5703-47212-0045 HE PROCEEDED TO THE POLICE STATION A SINGLE STORIED STONE BUILDING STANDING AT THE END OF A SIDE STREET HERE HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE INSPECTOR AND IMPARTED INFORMATION WHICH MADE THAT PERSONAGE OPEN HIS EYES CONSIDERABLY WIDER THAN WAS HIS CUSTOM
5703-47212-0046 IF YOU WILL BRING ONE OF YOUR MEN AND COME WITH ME YOURSELF SAID GIMBLET AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INTERVIEW
5703-47212-0047 IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
5703-47212-0048 SHE CARRIED THE TWO POLICEMEN ON HER DECK AS WELL AS THE MOST NOTORIOUS DETECTIVE SHE WAS EVER LIKELY TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CONVEYING IT WAS NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK WHEN THEY LANDED ON THE INVERASHIEL PIER
5703-47212-0049 THE WEATHER WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD LOOKED LIKE CLEARING HAD NOW TURNED DEFINITELY TO RAIN CLOUDS HAD DESCENDED ON THE HILLS AND THE TREES IN THE VALLEYS STOOPED AND DRIPPED IN THE SATURATED MIST LADEN AIR
5703-47212-0050 GIMBLET CONDUCTED THE MEN TO THE COTTAGE WHERE LADY RUTH ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THEM IF YOU DON'T MIND THEIR STAYING HERE HE SUGGESTED TO HER WHILE I GO UP TO THE CASTLE AND CONSULT LORD ASHIEL ABOUT A MAGISTRATE IT WILL BE MOST CONVENIENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISTANCE
5703-47212-0051 BY ALL MEANS SAID LADY RUTH I FEEL SAFER WITH THEM I EXPECT YOU WILL FIND MISS BYRNE UP THERE SHE HAS NOT COME IN TO LUNCH AND I THINK SHE PROBABLY MET MARK AND WENT TO LUNCH AT THE CASTLE SHE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THAN TO GO TO LUNCH ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN
5703-47212-0052 AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF SHE HAS CHANGED HER MIND AND ACCEPTED HIM AFTER ALL GIRLS ARE KITTLE CATTLE BUT I'VE GOT QUITE FOND OF THAT ONE AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT FORGOTTEN POOR DAVID SO SOON I REALLY AM FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
3112-9555-0000 CHAPTER ONE MY EDUCATION
3112-9555-0001 OF SO INSIGNIFICANT A PERSON AS MYSELF IT WILL NOT BE SO MUCH MY INTENTION TO SPEAK OF THE LITTLE DETAILS OF MY PRIVATE LIFE AS OF WHAT I AND PERHAPS OTHERS ROUND ME HAVE DONE IN LITERATURE
3112-9555-0002 OF MY FAILURES AND SUCCESSES SUCH AS THEY HAVE BEEN AND THEIR CAUSES AND OF THE OPENING WHICH A LITERARY CAREER OFFERS TO MEN AND WOMEN FOR THE EARNING OF THEIR BREAD
3112-9555-0003 AND YET THE GARRULITY OF OLD AGE AND THE APTITUDE OF A MAN'S MIND TO RECUR TO THE PASSAGES OF HIS OWN LIFE WILL I KNOW TEMPT ME TO SAY SOMETHING OF MYSELF
3112-9555-0004 NOR WITHOUT DOING SO SHOULD I KNOW HOW TO THROW MY MATTER INTO ANY RECOGNISED AND INTELLIGIBLE FORM THAT I OR ANY MAN SHOULD TELL EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF I HOLD TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
3112-9555-0005 I WILL SET DOWN NAUGHT IN MALICE NOR WILL I GIVE TO MYSELF OR OTHERS HONOUR WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY WON MY BOYHOOD WAS I THINK AS UNHAPPY AS THAT OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN COULD WELL BE
3112-9555-0006 MY MISFORTUNES ARISING FROM A MIXTURE OF POVERTY AND GENTLE STANDING ON THE PART OF MY FATHER
3112-9555-0007 I WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IN KEPPEL STREET RUSSELL SQUARE AND WHILE A BABY WAS CARRIED DOWN TO HARROW WHERE MY FATHER HAD BUILT A HOUSE ON A LARGE FARM
3112-9555-0008 AND PERHAPS THE DIRECTOR OF HER DESTINY AND OF OURS MY FATHER HAD BEEN A WYKAMIST AND A FELLOW OF NEW COLLEGE AND WINCHESTER WAS THE DESTINATION OF MY BROTHERS AND MYSELF
3112-9555-0009 AND SENT THREE OF US THERE ONE AFTER THE OTHER AT THE AGE OF SEVEN MY FATHER AT THIS TIME WAS A CHANCERY BARRISTER PRACTISING IN LONDON
3112-9555-0010 CHAMBERS WHICH ON ONE MELANCHOLY OCCASION DID BECOME ABSOLUTELY SUICIDAL
3112-9555-0011 IN HIS EARLY DAYS HE WAS A MAN OF SOME SMALL FORTUNE AND OF HIGHER HOPES THESE STOOD SO HIGH AT THE TIME OF MY BIRTH THAT HE WAS FELT TO BE ENTITLED TO A COUNTRY HOUSE AS WELL AS TO THAT IN KEPPEL STREET
3112-9555-0012 THIS PLACE HE CALLED JULIANS AND THE LAND RUNS UP TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON WHICH THE SCHOOL AND CHURCH STAND ON THE SIDE TOWARDS LONDON THINGS THERE WENT MUCH AGAINST HIM THE FARM WAS RUINOUS
3112-9555-0013 BUT AT ANY RATE AS OTHER DAY BOARDERS I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE WELL TREATED BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE IGNOMINY WHICH I ENDURED
3112-9555-0014 I WAS ONLY SEVEN AND I THINK THAT BOYS AT SEVEN ARE NOW SPARED AMONG THEIR MORE CONSIDERATE SENIORS I WAS NEVER SPARED AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO RUN TO AND FRO BETWEEN OUR HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL
3112-9555-0015 WITHOUT A DAILY PURGATORY NO DOUBT MY APPEARANCE WAS AGAINST ME I REMEMBER WELL WHEN I WAS STILL THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL DOCTOR BUTLER THE HEAD MASTER STOPPING ME IN THE STREET AND ASKING ME
3112-9555-0016 PERHAPS HE DID NOT RECOGNISE ME BY MY FACE AT THIS TIME I WAS THREE YEARS AT HARROW AND AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER I WAS THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL WHEN I LEFT IT
3112-9555-0017 THEN I WAS SENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY KEPT BY ARTHUR DRURY THIS I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVICE OF HENRY DRURY WHO WAS MY TUTOR AT HARROW SCHOOL AND MY FATHER'S FRIEND
3112-9555-0018 WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO VISIT THE PLAYGROUND TILL THE SERMON WAS FINISHED MINE WAS ONLY DONE A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS MISSUS DRURY WHEN SHE SAW US SHOOK HER HEAD WITH PITYING HORROR
3112-9555-0019 THERE WERE EVER SO MANY OTHER PUNISHMENTS ACCUMULATED ON OUR HEADS IT BROKE MY HEART KNOWING MYSELF TO BE INNOCENT AND SUFFERING ALSO UNDER THE ALMOST EQUALLY PAINFUL FEELING THAT THE OTHER THREE NO DOUBT WICKED BOYS
3112-9555-0020 MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LEADER OF WICKEDNESS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT TERM HE WHISPERED TO ME HALF A WORD THAT PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN WRONG WITH ALL A STUPID BOY'S SLOWNESS I SAID NOTHING
3112-9555-0021 AND HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO CARRY REPARATION FURTHER ALL THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO AND IT BURNS ME NOW AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY WHAT LILY LIVERED CURS THOSE BOYS MUST HAVE BEEN NOT TO HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH
3112-9555-0022 AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I REMEMBER THEIR NAMES WELL AND ALMOST WISH TO WRITE THEM HERE WHEN I WAS TWELVE THERE CAME THE VACANCY AT WINCHESTER COLLEGE WHICH I WAS DESTINED TO FILL
3112-9555-0023 MY TWO ELDER BROTHERS HAD GONE THERE AND THE YOUNGER HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY BEING ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE LOST HIS CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE IT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY FATHER'S LIFE THAT HIS THREE SONS WHO LIVED TO GO TO WINCHESTER
3112-9555-0024 SHOULD ALL BECOME FELLOWS OF NEW COLLEGE BUT THAT SUFFERING MAN WAS NEVER DESTINED TO HAVE AN AMBITION GRATIFIED WE ALL LOST THE PRIZE WHICH HE STRUGGLED WITH INFINITE LABOUR TO PUT WITHIN OUR REACH
3112-9555-0025 MY ELDEST BROTHER ALL BUT ACHIEVED IT AND AFTERWARDS WENT TO OXFORD TAKING THREE EXHIBITIONS FROM THE SCHOOL THOUGH HE LOST THE GREAT GLORY OF A WYKAMIST HE HAS SINCE MADE HIMSELF WELL KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC AS A WRITER
3112-9555-0026 IN CONNECTION WITH ALL ITALIAN SUBJECTS
3112-9555-0027 BUT MY OTHER BROTHER DIED EARLY WHILE I WAS AT WINCHESTER MY FATHER'S AFFAIRS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE HE GAVE UP HIS PRACTICE AT THE BAR AND UNFORTUNATE THAT HE WAS TOOK ANOTHER FARM
3112-9555-0028 IT IS ODD THAT A MAN SHOULD CONCEIVE AND IN THIS CASE A HIGHLY EDUCATED AND A VERY CLEVER MAN THAT FARMING SHOULD BE A BUSINESS IN WHICH HE MIGHT MAKE MONEY WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL EDUCATION OR APPRENTICESHIP
3112-9555-0029 PERHAPS OF ALL TRADES IT IS THE ONE IN WHICH AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THINGS SHOULD BE DONE AND THE BEST MANNER OF DOING THEM IS MOST NECESSARY AND IT IS ONE ALSO FOR SUCCESS IN WHICH A SUFFICIENT CAPITAL IS INDISPENSABLE
3112-9555-0030 HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN HE TOOK THIS SECOND FARM NO CAPITAL THIS WAS THE LAST STEP PREPARATORY TO HIS FINAL RUIN
3112-9555-0031 I HAVE NO CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF HER OBJECT OR OF MY FATHER'S BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT MONEY MIGHT BE MADE BY SENDING GOODS LITTLE GOODS SUCH AS PIN CUSHIONS PEPPER BOXES AND POCKET KNIVES OUT TO THE STILL UNFURNISHED STATES
3112-9555-0032 I HAVE SEEN IT SINCE IN THE TOWN OF CINCINNATI A SORRY BUILDING BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN IMPOSING EDIFICE MY MOTHER WENT FIRST WITH MY SISTERS AND SECOND BROTHER
3112-9555-0033 THEN MY FATHER FOLLOWED THEM TAKING MY ELDER BROTHER BEFORE HE WENT TO OXFORD
3112-9555-0034 THERE HAVE BEEN HOT WORDS BETWEEN US FOR PERFECT FRIENDSHIP BEARS AND ALLOWS HOT WORDS FEW BROTHERS HAVE HAD MORE OF BROTHERHOOD BUT IN THOSE SCHOOL DAYS HE WAS OF ALL MY FOES THE WORST
3112-9555-0035 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRACTICE OF THE COLLEGE WHICH SUBMITS OR DID THEN SUBMIT MUCH OF THE TUITION OF THE YOUNGER BOYS FROM THE ELDER HE WAS MY TUTOR AND IN HIS CAPACITY OF TEACHER AND RULER
3112-9555-0036 HE HAD STUDIED THE THEORIES OF DRACO
3112-9555-0037 HANG A LITTLE BOY FOR STEALING APPLES HE USED TO SAY AND OTHER LITTLE BOYS WILL NOT STEAL APPLES THE DOCTRINE WAS ALREADY EXPLODED ELSEWHERE BUT HE STUCK TO IT WITH CONSERVATIVE ENERGY THE RESULT WAS THAT AS
3112-9555-0038 A PART OF HIS DAILY EXERCISE HE THRASHED ME WITH A BIG STICK THAT SUCH THRASHINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE AT A SCHOOL AS A CONTINUAL PART OF ONE'S DAILY LIFE
3112-9555-0039 SEEMS TO ME TO ARGUE A VERY ILL CONDITION OF SCHOOL DISCIPLINE AT THIS PERIOD I REMEMBER TO HAVE PASSED ONE SET OF HOLIDAYS THE MIDSUMMER HOLIDAYS IN MY FATHER'S CHAMBERS IN LINCOLN'S INN
3112-9555-0040 THERE WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH ME ON THIS OCCASION MY AMUSEMENT CONSISTED IN WANDERING ABOUT AMONG THOSE OLD DESERTED BUILDINGS AND IN READING SHAKESPEARE OUT OF A BI COLUMNED EDITION
3112-9555-0041 WHICH IS STILL AMONG MY BOOKS IT WAS NOT THAT I HAD CHOSEN SHAKESPEARE BUT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO READ AFTER A WHILE MY BROTHER LEFT WINCHESTER AND ACCOMPANIED MY FATHER TO AMERICA
3112-9555-0042 THEN ANOTHER AND A DIFFERENT HORROR FELL TO MY FATE MY COLLEGE BILLS HAD NOT BEEN PAID AND THE SCHOOL TRADESMEN WHO ADMINISTERED TO THE WANTS OF THE BOYS WERE TOLD NOT TO EXTEND THEIR CREDIT TO ME
3112-9555-0043 BOOTS WAISTCOATS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS WHICH WITH SOME SLIGHT SUPERVEILLANCE WERE AT THE COMMAND OF OTHER SCHOLARS WERE CLOSED LUXURIES TO ME MY SCHOOLFELLOWS OF COURSE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO AND I BECAME A PARIAH
3112-9555-0044 IT IS THE NATURE OF BOYS TO BE CRUEL I HAVE SOMETIMES DOUBTED WHETHER AMONG EACH OTHER THEY DO USUALLY SUFFER MUCH ONE FROM THE OTHER'S CRUELTY BUT I SUFFERED HORRIBLY
3112-9555-0045 I COULD MAKE NO STAND AGAINST IT I HAD NO FRIEND TO WHOM I COULD POUR OUT MY SORROWS I WAS BIG AND AWKWARD AND UGLY AND I HAVE NO DOUBT SKULKED ABOUT IN A MOST UNATTRACTIVE MANNER
3112-9555-0046 OF COURSE I WAS ILL DRESSED AND DIRTY BUT AH HOW WELL I REMEMBER ALL THE AGONIES OF MY YOUNG HEART HOW I CONSIDERED WHETHER I SHOULD ALWAYS BE ALONE
3112-9555-0047 WHETHER I COULD NOT FIND MY WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT COLLEGE TOWER AND FROM THENCE PUT AN END TO EVERYTHING AND A WORSE THING CAME THAN THE STOPPAGE OF THE SUPPLIES FROM THE SHOPKEEPERS EVERY BOY HAD A SHILLING A WEEK POCKET MONEY WHICH WE CALLED BATTELS
3112-9555-0048 AND WHICH WAS ADVANCED TO US OUT OF THE POCKET OF THE SECOND MASTER ON ONE AWFUL DAY THE SECOND MASTER ANNOUNCED TO ME THAT MY BATTELS WOULD BE STOPPED HE TOLD ME THE REASON
3112-9555-0049 THE BATTELS FOR THE LAST HALF YEAR HAD NOT BEEN REPAID AND HE URGED HIS OWN UNWILLINGNESS TO ADVANCE THE MONEY THE LOSS OF A SHILLING A WEEK WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH EVEN THOUGH POCKET MONEY FROM OTHER SOURCES NEVER REACHED ME
3112-9555-0050 AND NOW WHEN IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ANY SERVANT HE RECEIVED SIXTY NINE SHILLINGS INSTEAD OF SEVENTY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DEFALCATION WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM
3112-9555-0051 WHEN I HAD BEEN AT WINCHESTER SOMETHING OVER THREE YEARS MY FATHER RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND TOOK ME AWAY WHETHER THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OR BECAUSE MY CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE PASSED AWAY
3112-9555-0052 MY FATHER AT THIS TIME HAVING LEFT MY MOTHER AND SISTERS WITH MY YOUNGER BROTHER IN AMERICA TOOK HIMSELF TO LIVE AT A WRETCHED TUMBLE DOWN FARMHOUSE ON THE SECOND FARM HE HAD HIRED AND I WAS TAKEN THERE WITH HIM IT WAS NEARLY THREE MILES FROM HARROW
3112-9555-0053 AT HARROW WEALD BUT IN THE PARISH AND FROM THIS HOUSE I WAS AGAIN SENT TO THAT SCHOOL AS A DAY BOARDER LET THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IS THE USUAL APPEARANCE AND WHAT THE USUAL APPURTENANCES OF A BOY AT SUCH A SCHOOL
3112-9555-0054 FROM BARNS TO COWSHEDS AND FROM COWSHEDS TO DUNG HEAPS ONE COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE ONE BEGAN AND THE OTHER ENDED THERE WAS A PARLOUR IN WHICH MY FATHER LIVED SHUT UP AMONG BIG BOOKS
3112-9555-0055 BUT I PASSED MY MOST JOCUND HOURS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING INNOCENT LOVE TO THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER THE FARM KITCHEN MIGHT BE VERY WELL THROUGH THE EVENING WHEN THE HORRORS OF THE SCHOOL WERE OVER BUT IT ALL ADDED TO THE CRUELTY OF THE DAYS
3112-9555-0056 A SIZAR AT A CAMBRIDGE COLLEGE OR A BIBLE CLERK AT OXFORD HAS NOT PLEASANT DAYS OR USED NOT TO HAVE THEM HALF A CENTURY AGO BUT HIS POSITION WAS RECOGNISED AND THE MISERY WAS MEASURED
3112-9555-0057 THE INDIGNITIES I ENDURED ARE NOT TO BE DESCRIBED AS I LOOK BACK IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL HANDS WERE TURNED AGAINST ME THOSE OF MASTERS AS WELL AS BOYS I WAS ALLOWED TO JOIN IN NO PLAYS
3112-9555-0058 THE ONLY EXPENSE EXCEPT THAT OF BOOKS TO WHICH A HOUSE BOARDER WAS THEN SUBJECT WAS THE FEE TO A TUTOR AMOUNTING I THINK TO TEN GUINEAS MY TUTOR TOOK ME WITHOUT THE FEE
3112-9555-0059 BUT WHEN I HEARD HIM DECLARE THE FACT IN THE PUPIL ROOM BEFORE THE BOYS I HARDLY FELT GRATEFUL FOR THE CHARITY I WAS NEVER A COWARD AND CARED FOR A THRASHING AS LITTLE AS ANY BOY
3112-9555-0060 BUT ONE CANNOT MAKE A STAND AGAINST THE ACERBITIES OF THREE HUNDRED TYRANTS WITHOUT A MORAL COURAGE OF WHICH AT THAT TIME I POSSESSED NONE I KNOW THAT I SKULKED AND WAS ODIOUS TO THE EYES OF THOSE I ADMIRED AND ENVIED
3112-9555-0061 AT LAST I WAS DRIVEN TO REBELLION AND THERE CAME A GREAT FIGHT AT THE END OF WHICH MY OPPONENT HAD TO BE TAKEN HOME FOR A WHILE IF THESE WORDS BE EVER PRINTED
3112-9555-0062 I TRUST THAT SOME SCHOOLFELLOW OF THOSE DAYS MAY STILL BE LEFT ALIVE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IN CLAIMING THIS SOLITARY GLORY OF MY SCHOOL DAYS I AM NOT MAKING A FALSE BOAST
3112-9555-0063 I WISH I COULD GIVE SOME ADEQUATE PICTURE OF THE GLOOM OF THAT FARMHOUSE MY ELDER BROTHER TOM AS I MUST CALL HIM IN MY NARRATIVE THOUGH THE WORLD I THINK KNOWS HIM BEST AS ADOLPHUS WAS AT OXFORD
3112-9555-0064 MY FATHER AND I LIVED TOGETHER HE HAVING NO MEANS OF LIVING EXCEPT WHAT CAME FROM THE FARM MY MEMORY TELLS ME THAT HE WAS ALWAYS IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLORD AND TO THE TRADESMEN HE EMPLOYED
3112-9555-0065 OF SELF INDULGENCE NO ONE COULD ACCUSE HIM OUR TABLE WAS POORER I THINK THAN THAT OF THE BAILIFF WHO STILL HUNG ON TO OUR SHATTERED FORTUNES THE FURNITURE WAS MEAN AND SCANTY
3112-9555-0066 INTO THE HAY FIELD ON HOLIDAYS I WAS OFTEN COMPELLED TO GO NOT I FEAR WITH MUCH PROFIT MY FATHER'S HEALTH WAS VERY BAD DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE SPENT NEARLY THE HALF OF HIS TIME IN BED
3112-9555-0067 IT WAS HIS AMBITION TO DESCRIBE ALL ECCLESIASTICAL TERMS INCLUDING THE DENOMINATIONS OF EVERY FRATERNITY OF MONKS AND EVERY CONVENT OF NUNS WITH ALL THEIR ORDERS AND SUBDIVISIONS
3112-9555-0068 UNDER CRUSHING DISADVANTAGES WITH FEW OR NO BOOKS OF REFERENCE WITH IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO NO LIBRARY HE WORKED AT HIS MOST UNGRATEFUL TASK WITH UNFLAGGING INDUSTRY WHEN HE DIED
3112-9555-0069 THREE NUMBERS OUT OF EIGHT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED BY SUBSCRIPTION AND ARE NOW I FEAR UNKNOWN AND BURIED IN THE MIDST OF THAT HUGE PILE OF FUTILE LITERATURE THE BUILDING UP OF WHICH HAS BROKEN SO MANY HEARTS
3112-9555-0070 AND MY FATHER THOUGH HE WOULD TRY
3112-9555-0071 AND SAY MY EARLY RULES FROM THE LATIN GRAMMAR OR REPEAT THE GREEK ALPHABET AND WAS OBLIGED AT THESE EARLY LESSONS TO HOLD MY HEAD INCLINED TOWARDS HIM
3112-9555-0072 SO THAT IN THE EVENT OF GUILTY FAULT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL MY HAIR WITHOUT STOPPING HIS RAZOR OR DROPPING HIS SHAVING BRUSH NO FATHER WAS EVER MORE ANXIOUS FOR THE EDUCATION OF HIS CHILDREN
3112-9555-0073 THOUGH I THINK NONE EVER KNEW LESS HOW TO GO ABOUT THE WORK OF AMUSEMENT AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER HE NEVER RECOGNISED THE NEED
3112-9555-0074 HE COULD NOT GIVE HIS TIME TO TEACH ME FOR EVERY HOUR THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE FIELDS WAS DEVOTED TO HIS MONKS AND NUNS BUT HE WOULD REQUIRE ME TO SIT AT A TABLE WITH LEXICON AND GRADUS BEFORE ME
3112-9555-0075 THOUGH I THINK I GRIEVED HIM MUCH BY MY IDLENESS BUT IN PASSION HE KNEW NOT WHAT HE DID AND HE HAS KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH THE GREAT FOLIO BIBLE WHICH HE ALWAYS USED
3112-9555-0076 IN THE OLD HOUSE WERE THE TWO FIRST VOLUMES OF COOPER'S NOVEL CALLED THE PRAIRIE A RELIC PROBABLY A DISHONEST RELIC OF SOME SUBSCRIPTION TO HOOKHAM'S LIBRARY OTHER BOOKS OF THE KIND THERE WAS NONE
3112-9555-0077 I WONDER HOW MANY DOZEN TIMES I READ THOSE TWO FIRST VOLUMES
3112-9555-0078 IT WAS THE HORROR OF THOSE DREADFUL WALKS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WHICH MADE MY LIFE SO BAD WHAT SO PLEASANT WHAT SO SWEET AS A WALK ALONG AN ENGLISH LANE WHEN THE AIR IS SWEET AND THE WEATHER FINE
3112-9555-0079 AND WHEN THERE IS A CHARM IN WALKING BUT HERE WERE THE SAME LANES FOUR TIMES A DAY IN WET AND DRY IN HEAT AND SUMMER WITH ALL THE ACCOMPANYING MUD AND DUST AND WITH DISORDERED CLOTHES
3112-9555-0080 BUT HIS SUCCESSOR LIVED TO BE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY I THINK IT WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE THAT MY MOTHER WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY RETURNED FROM AMERICA
3112-9555-0081 SHE LIVED AT FIRST AT THE FARMHOUSE BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME SHE CAME BACK WITH A BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND THE IMMEDIATE PECUNIARY SUCCESS WHICH THAT WORK OBTAINED ENABLED HER TO TAKE US ALL BACK TO THE HOUSE AT HARROW
3112-9555-0082 NOT TO THE FIRST HOUSE WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN BEYOND HER MEANS BUT TO THAT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN CALLED ORLEY FARM AND WHICH WAS AN EDEN AS COMPARED TO OUR ABODE AT HARROW WEALD
3112-9555-0083 HERE MY SCHOOLING WENT ON UNDER SOMEWHAT IMPROVED CIRCUMSTANCES THE THREE MILES BECAME HALF A MILE AND PROBABLY SOME SALUTARY CHANGES WERE MADE IN MY WARDROBE
3112-9555-0084 AND A GREAT ELEMENT OF HAPPINESS WAS ADDED TO US ALL IN THE AFFECTIONATE AND LIFE ENDURING FRIENDSHIP OF THE FAMILY OF OUR CLOSE NEIGHBOUR COLONEL GRANT BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO OVERCOME OR EVEN TO ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THE ABSOLUTE ISOLATION OF MY SCHOOL POSITION
3112-9555-0085 I HAVE FELT THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO TALK OF THINGS FROM MOST OF WHICH I WAS KEPT IN ESTRANGEMENT THROUGH ALL MY FATHER'S TROUBLES HE STILL DESIRED TO SEND ME EITHER TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE
3112-9555-0086 AND VERY FORTUNATE IT WAS THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED FOR MY CAREER WITH SUCH ASSISTANCE ONLY AS A SCHOLARSHIP WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME WOULD HAVE ENDED IN DEBT AND IGNOMINY WHEN I LEFT HARROW I WAS ALL BUT NINETEEN
3112-9555-0087 AND I HAD AT FIRST GONE THERE AT SEVEN DURING THE WHOLE OF THOSE TWELVE YEARS NO ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO TEACH ME ANYTHING BUT LATIN AND GREEK AND VERY LITTLE ATTEMPT TO TEACH ME THOSE LANGUAGES
3112-9555-0088 AT THE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY THERE WAS CERTAINLY A WRITING MASTER AND A FRENCH MASTER THE LATTER WAS AN EXTRA AND I NEVER HAD EXTRAS
3112-9555-0089 I SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WRITING MASTER'S CLASS BUT THOUGH I CAN CALL TO MIND THE MAN I CANNOT CALL TO MIND HIS FERULE IT WAS BY THEIR FERULES THAT I ALWAYS KNEW THEM AND THEY ME
3112-9555-0090 I FEEL CONVINCED IN MY MIND THAT I HAVE BEEN FLOGGED OFTENER THAN ANY HUMAN BEING ALIVE IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN FIVE SCOURGINGS IN ONE DAY AT WINCHESTER
3112-9555-0091 AND I HAVE OFTEN BOASTED THAT I OBTAINED THEM ALL LOOKING BACK OVER HALF A CENTURY
3112-9555-0092 I AM NOW A FAIR LATIN SCHOLAR THAT IS TO SAY I READ AND ENJOY THE LATIN CLASSICS AND COULD PROBABLY MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD IN LATIN PROSE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I HAVE I HAVE ACQUIRED SINCE I LEFT SCHOOL
3112-9555-0093 I BEAR IN MIND WELL WITH HOW PRODIGAL A HAND PRIZES USED TO BE SHOWERED ABOUT BUT I NEVER GOT A PRIZE FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST THERE WAS NOTHING SATISFACTORY IN MY SCHOOL CAREER
4406-16883-0000 AND THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD HUSBAND AND FATHER AND CHILDREN AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS AND RELATIONS AND HOUSE AND HOME AND MANY COMFORTS OF THIS LIFE BUT NOW WE MAY SAY AS JOB
4406-16883-0001 AND HE LIGHTED UPON THAT COMFORTABLE SCRIPTURE I SHALL NOT DIE BUT LIVE AND DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD
4406-16883-0002 EVEN AS THE PSALMIST SAYS TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD AND HIS WONDERFUL POWER IN CARRYING US ALONG PRESERVING US IN THE WILDERNESS WHILE UNDER THE ENEMY'S HAND AND RETURNING OF US IN SAFETY AGAIN AND HIS GOODNESS
4406-16883-0003 IN BRINGING TO MY HAND SO MANY COMFORTABLE AND SUITABLE SCRIPTURES IN MY DISTRESS BUT TO RETURN
4406-16883-0004 AND IN THE MORNING WE MUST GO OVER THE RIVER TO PHILIP'S CREW
4406-16883-0005 WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME TO MY REMEMBRANCE THAT I WEPT BEFORE THEM ALTHOUGH I HAD MET WITH SO MUCH AFFLICTION AND MY HEART WAS MANY TIMES READY TO BREAK YET COULD I NOT SHED ONE TEAR IN THEIR SIGHT BUT RATHER
4406-16883-0006 BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON THERE WE SATE DOWN
4406-16883-0007 THEN CAME ONE OF THEM AND GAVE ME TWO SPOONFULS OF MEAL TO COMFORT ME AND ANOTHER GAVE ME HALF A PINT OF PEAS WHICH WAS MORE WORTH THAN MANY BUSHELS AT ANOTHER TIME THEN I WENT TO SEE KING PHILIP HE BADE ME COME IN AND SIT DOWN
4406-16883-0008 AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD SMOKE IT A USUAL COMPLIMENT NOWADAYS AMONGST SAINTS AND SINNERS BUT THIS NO WAY SUITED ME FOR THOUGH I HAD FORMERLY USED TOBACCO YET I HAD LEFT IT EVER SINCE I WAS FIRST TAKEN
4406-16883-0009 IT SEEMS TO BE A BAIT THE DEVIL LAYS TO MAKE MEN LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS TIME
4406-16883-0010 WHEN I HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE PIPES I WAS PRESENTLY READY FOR ANOTHER SUCH A BEWITCHING THING IT IS BUT I THANK GOD HE HAS NOW GIVEN ME POWER OVER IT SURELY THERE ARE MANY WHO
4406-16883-0011 WHEREUPON THEY FELL TO BOILING OF GROUND NUTS AND PARCHING OF CORN
4406-16883-0012 DURING MY ABODE IN THIS PLACE PHILIP SPAKE TO ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HIS BOY WHICH I DID FOR WHICH HE GAVE ME A SHILLING I OFFERED THE MONEY TO MY MASTER BUT HE BADE ME KEEP IT AND WITH IT I BOUGHT A PIECE OF HORSE FLESH
4406-16883-0013 AFTERWARDS HE ASKED ME TO MAKE A CAP FOR HIS BOY FOR WHICH HE INVITED ME TO DINNER I WENT AND HE GAVE ME A PANCAKE ABOUT AS BIG AS TWO FINGERS IT WAS MADE OF PARCHED WHEAT BEATEN AND FRIED IN BEAR'S GREASE
4406-16883-0014 AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE
4406-16883-0015 HEARING THAT MY SON WAS COME TO THIS PLACE I WENT TO SEE HIM AND FOUND HIM LYING FLAT UPON THE GROUND I ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD SLEEP SO HE ANSWERED ME THAT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT AT PRAYER AND LAY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OBSERVE WHAT HE WAS DOING
4406-16883-0016 I PRAY GOD HE MAY REMEMBER THESE THINGS NOW HE IS RETURNED IN SAFETY AT THIS PLACE THE SUN NOW GETTING HIGHER WHAT WITH THE BEAMS AND HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE SMOKE OF THE WIGWAMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLIND
4406-16883-0017 WHO OWNED THAT MARY THURSTON CAME RUNNING AFTER ME AND GOT IT AWAY AGAIN
4406-16883-0018 I PUT IT IN MY POCKET TO KEEP IT SAFE YET NOTWITHSTANDING SOMEBODY STOLE IT BUT PUT FIVE INDIAN CORNS IN THE ROOM OF IT WHICH CORNS WERE THE GREATEST PROVISIONS I HAD IN MY TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY
4406-16883-0019 AND SELL ME FOR POWDER FOR SO THEY HAD SOMETIMES DISCOURSED I WAS UTTERLY HOPELESS OF GETTING HOME ON FOOT THE WAY THAT I CAME I COULD HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF THE MANY WEARY STEPS I HAD TAKEN TO COME TO THIS PLACE THE NINTH REMOVE
4406-16883-0020 BUT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO ALBANY OR HOMEWARD WE MUST GO FIVE MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN GO OVER IT HERE WE ABODE A WHILE HERE LIVED A SORRY INDIAN WHO SPOKE TO ME TO MAKE HIM A SHIRT WHEN I HAD DONE IT HE WOULD PAY ME NOTHING
4406-16883-0021 BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT
4406-16883-0022 AND I WAS NOT A LITTLE GLAD THAT I HAD ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT OF AND BE PLEASED WITH WHEN WE WERE AT THIS PLACE MY MASTER'S MAID CAME HOME SHE HAD BEEN GONE THREE WEEKS INTO THE NARRAGANSETT COUNTRY TO FETCH CORN
4406-16883-0023 WHERE THEY HAD STORED UP SOME IN THE GROUND
4406-16883-0024 I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
4406-16883-0025 AND THEN I RETURNED AGAIN WHEN I WAS RETURNED I FOUND MYSELF AS UNSATISFIED AS I WAS BEFORE
4406-16883-0026 MY SON WAS ILL AND I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF HIS MOURNFUL LOOKS AND NO CHRISTIAN FRIEND WAS NEAR HIM TO DO ANY OFFICE OF LOVE FOR HIM EITHER FOR SOUL OR BODY AND MY POOR GIRL I KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHETHER SHE WAS SICK OR WELL OR ALIVE OR DEAD
4406-16883-0027 I REPAIRED UNDER THESE THOUGHTS TO MY BIBLE MY GREAT COMFORT IN THAT TIME AND THAT SCRIPTURE CAME TO MY HAND CAST THY BURDEN UPON THE LORD AND HE SHALL SUSTAIN THEE PSALM FIFTY FIVE
4406-16883-0028 FOR FEAR THEY WOULD GET IT FROM ME AND THERE IT LAY ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT IN MY STINKING POCKET
4406-16883-0029 BUT NOW THAT WAS SAVORY TO ME THAT ONE WOULD THINK WAS ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF A BRUTE CREATURE ONE BITTER COLD DAY I COULD FIND NO ROOM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
4406-16883-0030 AND GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS AND BADE ME COME AGAIN AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD BUY ME IF THEY WERE ABLE AND YET THESE WERE STRANGERS TO ME THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE THE TENTH REMOVE
4406-16883-0031 AND PUT IT INTO MY POCKET AND NEVER LET HER SEE IT AFTERWARD THEN THEY PACKED UP THEIR THINGS TO BE GONE AND GAVE ME MY LOAD I COMPLAINED IT WAS TOO HEAVY WHEREUPON SHE GAVE ME A SLAP IN THE FACE AND BADE ME GO
4406-16883-0032 I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE
4406-16883-0033 MUCH CHEERED MY SPIRIT AND MADE MY BURDEN SEEM LIGHT AND ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT AND GREAT PERPLEXITY THE SCALE WAS SOON TURNED FOR WHEN WE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY ON A SUDDEN MY MISTRESS GIVES OUT
4406-16883-0034 AND WOULD HAVE HAD HIM GONE BACK ALSO BUT HE WOULD NOT BUT SAID HE WOULD GO ON AND COME TO US AGAIN IN THREE DAYS MY SPIRIT WAS UPON THIS I CONFESS VERY IMPATIENT AND ALMOST OUTRAGEOUS
4406-16883-0035 BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD PSALM FORTY SIX
4406-16883-0036 WHICH WERE SOME REFRESHMENT TO ME TOWARDS NIGHT I GATHERED SOME STICKS FOR MY OWN COMFORT THAT I MIGHT NOT LIE A COLD BUT WHEN WE CAME TO LIE DOWN THEY BADE ME TO GO OUT AND LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY HAD COMPANY THEY SAID COME IN MORE THAN THEIR OWN
4406-16883-0037 I TOLD THEM I COULD NOT TELL WHERE TO GO THEY BADE ME GO LOOK I TOLD THEM IF I WENT TO ANOTHER WIGWAM THEY WOULD BE ANGRY AND SEND ME HOME AGAIN THEN ONE OF THE COMPANY DREW HIS SWORD AND TOLD ME HE WOULD RUN ME THROUGH IF I DID NOT GO PRESENTLY THEN
4406-16883-0038 WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT
4406-16883-0039 I WENT TO ONE WIGWAM AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NO ROOM THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER AND THEY SAID THE SAME AT LAST AN OLD INDIAN BADE ME TO COME TO HIM AND HIS SQUAW GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS
4406-16883-0040 AND A GOOD FIRE WE HAD AND THROUGH THE GOOD PROVIDENCE OF GOD I HAD A COMFORTABLE LODGING THAT NIGHT IN THE MORNING ANOTHER INDIAN BADE ME COME AT NIGHT AND HE WOULD GIVE ME SIX GROUND NUTS WHICH I DID
4406-16883-0041 WE WENT IN THE MORNING TO GATHER GROUND NUTS TO THE RIVER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THAT NIGHT I WENT WITH A GOOD LOAD AT MY BACK FOR THEY WHEN THEY WENT THOUGH BUT A LITTLE WAY WOULD CARRY ALL THEIR TRUMPERY WITH THEM I TOLD THEM THE SKIN WAS OFF MY BACK
4406-16883-0042 BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
4406-16883-0043 WHERE WE ABODE ALMOST A FORTNIGHT HERE ONE ASKED ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HER PAPOOSE FOR WHICH SHE GAVE ME A MESS OF BROTH WHICH WAS THICKENED WITH MEAL MADE OF THE BARK OF A TREE AND TO MAKE IT THE BETTER
4406-16883-0044 AND A FEW ROASTED GROUND NUTS I HAD NOT SEEN MY SON A PRETTY WHILE
4406-16883-0045 AND ASKED HIM WHEN HE SAW HIM HE ANSWERED ME THAT SUCH A TIME HIS MASTER ROASTED HIM
4406-16883-0046 AS BIG AS HIS TWO FINGERS AND THAT HE WAS VERY GOOD MEAT BUT THE LORD UPHELD MY SPIRIT UNDER THIS DISCOURAGEMENT
4406-16883-0047 THAT MAKES THE LEAST CONSCIENCE OF SPEAKING OF TRUTH IN THIS PLACE ON A COLD NIGHT AS I LAY BY THE FIRE I REMOVED A STICK THAT KEPT THE HEAT FROM ME
4406-16883-0048 YET UPON THIS AND THE LIKE OCCASIONS I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY WITH JOB
4406-16883-0049 BUT WHEN I WAS WITHOUT AND SAW NOTHING BUT WILDERNESS AND WOODS AND A COMPANY OF BARBAROUS HEATHENS MY MIND QUICKLY RETURNED TO ME WHICH MADE ME THINK OF THAT SPOKEN CONCERNING SAMPSON WHO SAID I WILL GO OUT AND SHAKE MYSELF AS AT OTHER TIMES
4406-16883-0050 BUT HE WIST NOT THAT THE LORD WAS DEPARTED FROM HIM ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO THINK THAT ALL MY HOPES OF RESTORATION WOULD COME TO NOTHING I THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH ARMY AND HOPED FOR THEIR COMING AND BEING TAKEN BY THEM BUT THAT FAILED
4406-16883-0051 I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND
4406-16883-0052 AS MY MASTER SPAKE BUT INSTEAD OF THAT MY MASTER HIMSELF WAS GONE AND I LEFT BEHIND SO THAT MY SPIRIT WAS NOW QUITE READY TO SINK I ASKED THEM TO LET ME GO OUT AND PICK UP SOME STICKS THAT I MIGHT GET ALONE AND POUR OUT MY HEART UNTO THE LORD
4406-16883-0053 THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE POOR MAN ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS I DESIRED ALSO TO GO AND SEE HIM AND WHEN I CAME HE WAS CRYING BITTERLY SUPPOSING THEY WOULD QUICKLY KILL HIM WHEREUPON I ASKED ONE OF THEM WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO KILL HIM HE ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD NOT
4406-16883-0054 HE BEING A LITTLE CHEERED WITH THAT I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY HUSBAND HE TOLD ME HE SAW HIM SUCH A TIME IN THE BAY AND HE WAS WELL BUT VERY MELANCHOLY BY WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THOUGH I SUSPECTED IT BEFORE
4406-16883-0055 THAT WHATSOEVER THE INDIANS TOLD ME RESPECTING HIM WAS VANITY AND LIES SOME OF THEM TOLD ME HE WAS DEAD AND THEY HAD KILLED HIM SOME SAID HE WAS MARRIED AGAIN AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WISHED HIM TO MARRY AND TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CHOICE
4406-16883-0056 AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS
4406-16883-0057 I TOLD HER I WOULD TEAR HER COAT THEN WITH THAT MY MISTRESS RISES UP
4406-16883-0058 WERE GOING TO THE FRENCH FOR POWDER BUT BY THE WAY THE MOHAWKS MET WITH THEM AND KILLED FOUR OF THEIR COMPANY WHICH MADE THE REST TURN BACK AGAIN FOR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN SOLD TO THE FRENCH
4406-16883-0059 THAN IT PROVED TO BE IN HIS REMAINING WITH THE INDIANS I WENT TO SEE AN ENGLISH YOUTH IN THIS PLACE
4406-16883-0060 HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SICK OF A FLUX WITH EATING SO MUCH BLOOD THEY HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND WITH HIM AN INDIAN PAPOOSE ALMOST DEAD WHOSE PARENTS HAD BEEN KILLED
1116-137572-0000 THE WEDDING SHUTS ONE GATE AND OPENS ANOTHER THE LONGINGS AND DREAMINGS OF COURTSHIP ARE AT AN END THE SUPREME INTIMACY OF LIFE BEGINS AS JOHN AND MARY MOVE AWAY FROM THE ALTAR PRONOUNCED MAN AND WIFE THEY KNOW THEY ARE STARTING A GREAT ADVENTURE
1116-137572-0001 HIS BEAMING FACE MASKS A STIFF DETERMINATION TO KEEP HIS BRIDE HAPPY IN SPITE OF ANY WORLDLY OBSTACLES HER RADIANCE HIDES A SOLEMN INWARD VOW TO DO EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SMOOTH THE WAY OF THEIR LIFE TOGETHER THEY ARE RIGHT
1116-137572-0002 UNLESS THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOST PEOPLE THIS NEW JOINT ENTERPRISE IS GOING TO MEAN MORE TO EACH OF THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE EVER CAN BEFORE THEM IS A CLEAR ROAD NOT TO HAPPINESS AS THEY MAY BELIEVE BUT TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GAINING HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0003 WHEN ONE HAS RECEIVED THE PROMISE OF SOMETHING GREATLY DESIRED BUT MUST WAIT AWHILE BEFORE ITS DELIVERY THE HAPPINESS OF THE WAITING PERIOD IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A CRITICAL SPIRIT AND THEREFORE IS APT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS AN EXPERIENCE OF PURE DELIGHT
1116-137572-0004 BUT THE FIRST DAYS OF MARRIAGE BRING OUT A DIFFERENT SET OF FEELINGS THOSE THAT COME WHEN ONE HAS DEFINITELY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF ANYTHING THAT BEFORE WAS ONLY PROMISED AT FIRST THE EMOTIONS SEEM TO STAND STILL THIS IS THE LONG COVETED MOMENT THEN ONE BEGINS TO APPRAISE
1116-137572-0005 IS THE OBJECT OF ONE'S WISHES AS DESIRABLE AS ONE HAD EXPECTED BECAUSE REALITY RARELY MEASURES UP TO IMAGINATION THE FIRST ANSWER IS ALMOST BOUND TO BE NO THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND THE FIRST EMOTION TENDS TO BE DISAPPOINTMENT
1116-137572-0006 REGARDLESS OF HAZY BUT OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATIONS AND THE OBJECT POSSESSED WILL MORE THAN LIKELY TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE IMAGINATION PICTURED KNOWING THAT A FLEETING SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IS NOT PECULIAR TO ONE'S OWN MARRIAGE BUT LIKELY TO OCCUR IN ALL
1116-137572-0007 ROUGHLY BOTH THE HELPS AND THE HINDRANCES TO MARRIED HAPPINESS CAN BE LUMPED UNDER ONE WORD PERSONALITIES TEMPERAMENT MANNERISMS TASTES ALL THAT IS IMPLIED IN THE DISTINCT INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH PERSON MAKE UP THE CHIEF SOURCE OF THE ADVANTAGES
1116-137572-0008 AND DISADVANTAGES WITH WHICH THE COUPLE ENTER MARRIAGE THESE TRAITS CANNOT BE CHANGED OVERNIGHT NOR IS IT NECESSARY OR AT ALL WISE THAT THEY SHOULD BE JOHN ATTRACTS MARY AND SHE APPEALS TO HIM BECAUSE THE PERSONALITY OF EACH ONE IS WHAT IT IS
1116-137572-0009 LOVE HAS GROWN UP BETWEEN THE TWO AS A RESULT OF THIS PERSONALITY ATTRACTION AND LOVE IS THE MOTIVE THAT WILL MAKE BOTH TRY TO KEEP OPEN THE PATHWAY TO MARRIAGE SUCCESS BUT LOVE IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT THAT ONCE IT COMES CAN FOREVER AFTER BE TRUSTED TO KEEP ITS STRENGTH
1116-137572-0010 LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS ALIVE IT MUST BE KEPT GROWING THROUGH EXERCISE OR IT WASTES AWAY LOVE GIVES THE PUSH THAT KEEPS A MARRIAGE MOVING BUT IT DOES NOT GIVE THE DIRECTION THAT COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION
1116-137572-0011 THIS IS WHAT THEY MUST GUARD AGAINST WHILE LOVE IS STILL THE MOVING FORCE OF THEIR LIVES THEY MUST STUDY THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE DUE TO COME TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE BESET BY THEM IS TO BEG FOR TROUBLE
1116-137572-0012 IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THEIR PROBLEMS THEY MUST REALIZE FIRST THAT THEY CANNOT STUMBLE UPON MARRIED HAPPINESS THAT THEY MUST POSSESS AND CULTIVATE A POSITIVE WILL TO SUCCEED
1116-137572-0013 HERE ARE NINE GUIDEPOSTS TO HELP JOHN AND MARY ALONG THEIR ROAD ONE THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS THE BUILDING OF A UNION THAT IS JUST TO BOTH THE SMALLER ISSUES ON WHICH THIS RESTS ARE THE LIVELY CLASHES OF OPPOSITE DESIRES
1116-137572-0014 INEVITABLE IN THE COMING TOGETHER OF ANY TWO PERSONS INTENSIFIED WHEN THOSE TWO PERSONS ARE AS DIFFERENT AS A MAN AND A WOMAN AND UNAVOIDABLE FOR TWO COMMITTED TO A LIFETIME TOGETHER IN THE CLOSE QUARTERS OF MARRIAGE TWO
1116-137572-0015 COMPROMISE WILL LIFT THESE ESSENTIALLY PETTY DECISIONS OF PRECEDENCE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF SELFISHNESS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR BOTH NOT THE SELFISH OR NARROW WISH OF EITHER
1116-137572-0016 THE CHOICE THAT BRINGS THE LARGER ADVANTAGE TO THE TWO PERSONS IN THEIR COMMON ROLE OF MARRIAGE PARTNERS IS THE ONE TO BE MADE HUMAN JUDGMENT BEING AS FAULTY AS IT IS
1116-137572-0017 IN EITHER SITUATION THE PARTICULAR COUPLE INVOLVED HAVE TO WEIGH DELICATELY THE EFFECT ON THEIR JOINT ENTERPRISE OF THE CONFLICTING COURSES OF ACTION MUCH AS MARY MAY CRAVE A CHILD OR A CAR
1116-137572-0018 IF EACH ONE IS HURT AT THE OTHER'S INABILITY TO JOIN INSTANTLY IN HIS OR HER PLANS THEY WILL NEED TO TAKE PAINS NOT TO GET SIDETRACKED INTO MAKING A PERSONAL CONTEST OF THE AFFAIR TRYING TO WIN OVER YOUR PARTNER WITH A SINGLE EYE TO GETTING WHAT YOU WANT
1116-137572-0019 REGARDLESS OF ITS EFFECT ON THE MATE IS SHORT SIGHTED IN THE EXTREME EVEN IF YOU COULD CARE ONLY FOR PERSONAL PLEASURE THAT CANNOT LONG OUTLAST YOUR SPOUSE'S DISPLEASURE STAGING A CONTEST OR A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CONTESTS FOR THE SAKE OF FINDING OUT WHO IS BOSS
1116-137572-0020 BUILDS UP A HABIT OF FIGHTING THAT MAY LEAD TO A BITTER END IT IS USELESS TO DISCOVER WHO CAN WIN IN ANY PARTICULAR SKIRMISH WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN WHETHER ONE OF YOU IS SET ON BEING HEAD OF THE HOUSE IF YOUR SPOUSE CRAVES THAT DISTINCTION BY ALL MEANS HAND IT OVER WITHOUT DELAY
1116-137572-0021 IT IS AN EMPTY HONOR FOR THE ONE WHO BENDS BUT DOES NOT BREAK WILL READILY DEVELOP THE FINE ART OF INFLUENCING THE HEADSTRONG ONE BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE TRADITIONAL FEMININE CHARACTER TO ENJOY GIVING IN TO THE MAN THIS TENDENCY MUST BE SCRUTINIZED WHEN IT APPEARS
1116-137572-0022 NO MAN CAN AFFORD TO BE CRIPPLED FOR LIFE BY LETTING HIS WIFE SWADDLE HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AS SOME MOTHERS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN FOR THEIR OWN GLORIFICATION A WOMAN'S FEELING THAT SHE WILL BE EMOTIONALLY GRATIFIED BY MAKING A SACRIFICE DOES NOT PROVE THAT ASIDE FROM HER MOMENTARY PLEASURE
1116-137572-0023 ANY INDIVIDUAL WOMAN MAY WAVER BETWEEN A CRAVING FOR SELF SACRIFICE AND A REPUGNANCE TO THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT THIS CHANGEABLENESS CAN MAKE HER FEEL RESENTFUL AFTER SHE HAS GIVEN IN TO HER HUSBAND ALL THIS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MAKING DECISIONS
1116-137572-0024 COMPROMISE NOT SUBMISSION SHOULD BE THE RULE IF JOHN FORGES AHEAD ON ONE COUNT MARY MUST FIND AN ACCEPTABLE OUTLET FOR HERSELF ON SOME OTHER FRONT THREE
1116-137572-0025 AND THE EFFORT TO DO SO TO PLEASE THE PARTNER IS LIABLE TO RESULT IN A TOPHEAVY HYPOCRISY A SUPERSTRUCTURE CALCULATED TO IMPRESS THE OBSERVER BUT BUILT ON A SHAKY FOUNDATION OF CHAOS
1116-137572-0026 A CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOR EASILY TO MATCH ITS ENVIRONMENT OR TEMPER OF THE MOMENT BUT A HUMAN BEING'S MORE LASTING CHANGE IS NOT SO READILY MADE EACH MARRIAGE PARTNER MUST BE PROUD OF THE OTHER AND LET THE OTHER CONTINUE TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HER
1116-137572-0027 THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO RESPECT YOURSELF AND ACT AS IF YOU DID EVEN AT HOME TOO MANY COUPLES EXPLOIT THE SENSE OF LET DOWN THAT MARRIAGE BRINGS WITH IT AFTER SO LONG A TIME HUSBAND AND WIFE CEASE TO FEEL THAT THEY MUST EXERT THEMSELVES FOR EACH OTHER IN LITTLE MATTERS
1116-137572-0028 KNOWING THEMSELVES ACCEPTED THEY LOUNGE MENTALLY MANNERLY AND PHYSICALLY WHEN AT HOME OR ELSEWHERE ALONE TOGETHER SOME OF THIS RELAXATION IS A GOOD THING BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO LET HOME AND SPOUSE DEGENERATE INTO NOTHING MORE THAN AN INVITATION TO BE LAZY
1116-137572-0029 USING THE MATE FOR RELIEF AS IN NAGGING WHINING CRYING OR GRUMBLING IS TABOO IF YOU ARE TIRED OR IRRITABLE YOU CAN REST OR EXERCISE FOR RESTORATION AS IN THE DAYS BEFORE MARRIAGE
1116-137572-0030 AND DRY UP THE SOURCE OF REFRESHMENT YOU ARE TRYING TO TAP FATIGUE AND NERVOUSNESS EXPRESSED BREED FATIGUE AND NERVOUSNESS IN A SYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE FOUR TOO GREAT CONCENTRATION IS TO BE AVOIDED
1116-137572-0031 EVEN THE GREATEST LOVE STAGNATES IF IT IS KEPT OUT OF THE MAIN CURRENT OF LIFE TO CARE ONLY FOR EACH OTHER IS SELFISHNESS FOR TWO ONLY ONE STEP REMOVED FROM SELF CENTERED ENGROSSMENT
1116-137572-0032 THIS IS WHY THE UNIQUE VALUE OF CHILDREN IS THEIR SERVICE AS AN ENTERING WEDGE IN THE CLOSE GROWN LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE A WEDGE THAT WIDENS AND HOLDS FOREVER WIDER THE UNITY OF LOVE IT HAS PENETRATED OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OTHER INTERESTS MAY SERVE A SIMILAR PURPOSE
1116-137572-0033 THOUGH MORE EASILY DISLODGED AND SELDOM STRIKING SO DEEP FRIENDS OLD AND NEW HAVE A FUNCTION IN RELIEVING THE OVERCLOSE CONCERN OF ONE MARRIAGE PARTNER WITH THE OTHER IF THEY ARE TO PLAY THEIR FULL PART IN PREVENTING OVERCONCENTRATION
1116-137572-0034 COMMON FRIENDS ARE FINE BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE IS SPECIAL NEED OF FRIENDS FOR EITHER SPOUSE WHO CAN CALL FORTH THOSE SIDES OF HIS OR HER NATURE THAT ARE NOT AROUSED BY THE MATE
1116-137572-0035 THE FACTOR THAT UNDERLIES ALL THE PERPLEXITIES AND MOST OF THE CONTENTMENT OF MARRIAGE IS ITS UNIQUE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATED INTIMACY HERE THE SUPREME TESTING ALWAYS COMES EACH MEANS SO MUCH TO THE OTHER
1116-137572-0036 THE WIFE MAY BE ALONE PART OF THE DAY AND PROFIT BY IT WHEN JOHN COMES HOME AT NIGHT HE HAS NOT HAD THAT PRIVILEGE
1116-137572-0037 OR BY GOING OUT WITHOUT HIS WIFE OR BY HAVING HIS FRIENDS IN WHEN SHE IS NOT AROUND FIVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF EMOTION IS WHAT COUNTS NOT THE SPECTACULAR SCALING OF PEAKS STAKING ALL ON HIGH MOMENTS IS MELODRAMA WITH NO COMIC RELIEF
1116-137572-0038 SOME HUSBANDS SOME WIVES ARE ARTISTS AT ACHIEVING AND MOMENTARILY LIVING UP TO ROMANTIC SETTINGS BUT QUICKLY FLOP DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVELS OF DECENT FAIRNESS BETWEEN THE HIGH SPOTS OF THEIR SENTIMENTAL FLARE UPS OTHERS CANNOT UTTER A POETIC PHRASE
1116-137572-0039 MAKE A ROMANTIC GESTURE OR LET THEIR EYES SHOW THE QUICK INTENSITY OF THEIR TENDER EMOTIONS IF THEY MUST DIE FOR IT THIS DIFFERENCE IS ONE OF MAKE UP AND TRAINING NOT OF MARRIAGE CAPACITY THE COUPLE WHO ARE SURE OF EACH OTHER'S STEADY AFFECTION REGARDLESS OF ITS EXPRESSION IN ROMANTIC INTERLUDES
1116-137572-0040 ANOTHER TERRIBLE MOMENT THAT IS DUE TO COME MAY SEEM EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IT IS YOU WHO ARE SLIPPING SOON OR LATE YOU FIND THAT SOME FAMILIAR MANNERISM OF YOUR SPOUSE DISPLEASES YOU IT MAY BE A SLIGHT UNCOUTHNESS AT TABLE
1116-137572-0041 NOW IT VEXES YOU AND YOUR VEXATION TERRIFIES YOU DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU NO LONGER LOVE YOUR MATE AS YOU DID YOU CANNOT HELP YOUR CHANGE OF FEELING HOW THEN CAN YOU HOPE TO KEEP YOUR AFFECTION FROM DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER IF IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO WANE
1116-137572-0042 YOU REMEMBER OTHER PEOPLE YOU ONCE THOUGHT YOU LOVED AND WONDER PANIC STRICKEN HOW YOU CAN KEEP THIS LOVE FROM DYING AS THOSE OTHER LOVES DID THIS IS PROBABLY AN ALMOST UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE MARKING NOT THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF LOVE
1116-137572-0043 MATURITY BRINGS RECOGNITION OF HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS IN THE MOST HEROIC BUT ALSO DEVELOPS THE ABILITY TO WEIGH BIG AND LITTLE THINGS AND TO
1116-137572-0044 ALWAYS IT IS THE UNTURNED PAGE THE HOLDS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW GOES IT WITH THIS MARRIAGE THE PRESENT IS USEFUL ONLY AS A FOUNDATION STONE FOR THE FUTURE WHICH IS BEING BUILT UP OUT OF MANY FLEETING PRESENT MOMENTS EACH QUICKLY LOST IN THE PAST
1116-137572-0045 SEVEN THERE CAN BE NO NARROWING OF MARRIAGE TO MERE SEX ADJUSTMENT
1116-137572-0046 AND THE TWO PERSONS HAVE TO WORK OUT A COMMON LIFE THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM OVER AND ABOVE THE PLEASURE THEY MAY TAKE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AS A CONTINUING PART OF THIS LIFE ADJUSTMENT SEX ADJUSTMENT CAN DEVELOP INTO A PERMANENT FACTOR OF MARRIED HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0047 BUT WITHOUT THE LARGER ADJUSTMENT THE PARTIAL ADJUSTMENT CANNOT BE MADE IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL AND ENDURING FORM IN THE SEX LIFE IN MARRIAGE AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE ASSOCIATION EACH PARTNER WINS BY CONSIDERING THE OTHER BEFORE THE SELF
1116-137572-0048 BUT INSTEAD A COMPLETE TRUST IN EACH OTHER ONE WHO PRIDES HIMSELF OR HERSELF ON HAVING TO BE HANDLED WITH GLOVES HAS A GREAT DEAL OF GROWING UP TO DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTNER IN THE MARRIAGE CRY BABYING IS NO MORE HELPFUL IN MARRIAGE THAN IN BUSINESS OR SOCIAL LIFE
1116-137572-0049 IN THE HEALTHY MARRIAGE THIS SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE WILL SOON GIVE WAY TO ANGER WHICH IN TURN MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF A DASH OF COLD WATER IN THE FACE OF THE OVERSENSITIVE ONE HELPING HIM OR HER TO BUCK UP AND BEHAVE LIKE AN ADULT IN THE UNHEALTHY MARRIAGE SYMPATHY WILL GROW INTO PITY
1116-137572-0050 THE MARRIAGE PARTNER WHO IS MATURE WILL MAINTAIN TRUST IN THE OTHER'S GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE FACE OF WHAT MIGHT SEEM TO BE OCCASIONS FOR HURT FEELINGS A CHIEF ADVANTAGE OF THE MARRIED ESTATE IS ITS OPPORTUNITY FOR FRANKNESS WHY DOESN'T HIS WIFE TELL HIM OF THAT UNPLEASANT MANNERISM SO HE CAN CORRECT IT
1116-137572-0051 MARY MAY SOON LOSE COURAGE AND RELINQUISH HER WIFELY JOB OF HUSBAND IMPROVEMENT OR THE COMBINATION MAY BE REVERSED FRANKNESS MUST GO CLOTHED IN TACT STIFF MINDED PEOPLE WHO ARE FRANK ONLY WHEN ANGRY LOSE THEIR CASE BEFORE THEY PRESENT IT
1116-137572-0052 IF THE EXPRESSION OF ANGER IS TO HAVE ITS PROPER STIMULATIVE EFFECT IT HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED BUT RARELY AND THEN IN SMALL DOSES MORE HAS A PARALYZING EFFECT ON THE RECIPIENT
1116-137572-0053 PRODUCING A RESPONSE IN KIND THAT TAKES AWAY THE ABILITY TO THINK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT RETALIATION NINE WILLINGNESS TO GROW IS THE MOST NECESSARY FACTOR FOR SUCCESS MARRIAGE IS A LIFE PROGRAM OF GOING ON TOGETHER THAT REQUIRES MATURITY
1116-137572-0054 AS THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY THEY ARE AWARE OF INCREASING DISSATISFACTION THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE UNADAPTED TO EACH OTHER THEY ARE AFRAID TO LEAVE THE KNOWN PLEASURES OF THEIR FIRST YOUTH FOR THE UNGUESSED SATISFACTIONS OF MATURITY SO THEY TRY TO STAND STILL
1116-137572-0055 HOPING TO KEEP THEIR MARRIAGE UNCHANGED IN ITS FIRST STAGE OF PROMISE IF BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE ACCEPT MATURING RESPONSIBILITIES AS THEY COME THEIR MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP WILL KEEP PACE WITH THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL THEREFORE BECOME INCREASINGLY SATISFYING TO THEM
1116-132851-0000 AND SHOES WITH SILVER BUCKLES THE WOMEN WERE ALL FILLED WITH ENVY BUT LITTLE CARED BARBAIK WHAT THEY MIGHT WHISPER BEHIND HER BACK AS LONG AS SHE KNEW THAT HER CLOTHES WERE FINER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S AND THAT SHE HAD MORE PARTNERS THAN ANY OTHER GIRL
1116-132851-0001 AND WHAT WAS WORSE OFTEN MADE FUN OF HIM WITH THE REST
1116-132851-0002 ONE EVENING HE WAS BRINGING BACK HIS HORSES FROM THE FIELDS AND STOPPED AT A LITTLE LAKE ON THE WAY HOME TO LET THEM DRINK HE WAS TIRED WITH A LONG DAY'S WORK AND STOOD WITH HIS HAND ON THE MANE OF ONE OF THE ANIMALS WAITING TILL THEY HAD DONE AND THINKING ALL THE WHILE OF BARBAIK
1116-132851-0003 WHEN A VOICE CAME OUT OF THE GORSE CLOSE BY
1116-132851-0004 IT IS I THE BROWNIE OF THE LAKE REPLIED THE VOICE BUT WHERE ARE YOU INQUIRED JEGU LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE ME AMONG THE REEDS IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GREEN FROG I CAN TAKE HE ADDED PROUDLY ANY SHAPE I CHOOSE
1116-132851-0005 AND EVEN WHICH IS MUCH HARDER BE INVISIBLE IF I WANT TO THEN SHOW YOURSELF TO ME IN THE SHAPE IN WHICH YOUR FAMILY GENERALLY APPEAR REPLIED JEGU CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH AND THE FROG JUMPED ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE HORSES AND CHANGED INTO A LITTLE DWARF ALL DRESSED IN GREEN
1116-132851-0006 AT FIRST UNDER DIFFERENT ANIMAL SHAPES SINCE THAT TIME PARTLY FROM HABIT AND PARTLY TO AMUSE OURSELVES WE HAVE CONTINUED TO TRANSFORM OURSELVES AND IT WAS IN THIS WAY THAT I GOT TO KNOW YOU HOW EXCLAIMED JEGU FILLED WITH ASTONISHMENT
1116-132851-0007 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT EXCLAIMED JEGU WONDERINGLY THAT IS MY AFFAIR PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU LATER MEANWHILE YOU JUST EAT AND SLEEP AND DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
1116-132851-0008 JEGU DECLARED THAT NOTHING COULD BE EASIER AND THEN TAKING OFF HIS HAT HE THANKED THE DWARF HEARTILY AND LED HIS HORSES BACK TO THE FARM NEXT MORNING WAS A HOLIDAY AND BARBAIK WAS AWAKE EARLIER THAN USUAL
1116-132851-0009 AS SHE WISHED TO GET THROUGH HER WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BE READY TO START FOR A DANCE WHICH WAS TO BE HELD SOME DISTANCE OFF SHE WENT FIRST TO THE COW HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER DUTY TO KEEP CLEAN BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND FRESH STRAW PUT DOWN
1116-132851-0010 THE RACKS FILLED WITH HAY THE COWS MILKED AND THE PAILS STANDING NEATLY IN A ROW
1116-132851-0011 AND WHEN SHE MET HIM OUTSIDE THE DOOR SHE STOPPED AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS HELP TO BE SURE JEGU ONLY REPLIED ROUGHLY THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT THIS ANSWER MADE HER FEEL ALL THE MORE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS HE AND NOBODY ELSE
1116-132851-0012 INDEED BARBAIK HAD ONLY TO EXPRESS A WISH FOR IT TO BE SATISFIED IF THE WIND WAS COLD OR THE SUN WAS HOT AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO OUT LEST HER COMPLEXION SHOULD BE SPOILT SHE NEED ONLY TO RUN DOWN TO THE SPRING CLOSE BY AND SAY SOFTLY I SHOULD LIKE MY CHURNS TO BE FULL
1116-132851-0013 AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
1116-132851-0014 WHY AM I NOT ALREADY BACK FROM MORLAIX WITH MY MILK POT EMPTY MY BUTTER BOWL INSIDE IT A POUND OF WILD CHERRIES ON MY WOODEN PLATE AND THE MONEY I HAVE GAINED IN MY APRON POCKET AND IN THE MORNING WHEN SHE GOT UP LO AND BEHOLD
1116-132851-0015 AND SIX NEW PIECES OF SILVER IN THE POCKET OF HER APRON AND SHE BELIEVED THAT ALL THIS WAS OWING TO JEGU AND SHE COULD NO LONGER DO WITHOUT HIM EVEN IN HER THOUGHTS WHEN THINGS HAD REACHED THIS PASS THE BROWNIE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE HAD BETTER ASK BARBAIK TO MARRY HIM
1116-132851-0016 AND THIS TIME THE GIRL DID NOT TURN RUDELY AWAY BUT LISTENED PATIENTLY TO THE END
1116-132851-0017 AND SHE COULD SLEEP EVERY MORNING TILL BREAKFAST TIME JUST LIKE A YOUNG LADY AND AS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
1116-132851-0018 SHE WOULD WEAR THE BEAUTIFUL DRESSES THAT CAME WHEN SHE WISHED FOR THEM
1116-132851-0019 BARBAIK WAS FURIOUS
1116-132851-0020 HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH RAGE AGAINST THE BROWNIE WHO HAD CAUSED HER TO EXPECT A LIFE OF EASE AND PLEASURE BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED AT JEGU AND BEHELD HIS RED FACE SQUINTING EYES AND UNTIDY HAIR HER ANGER WAS DOUBLED
1116-132851-0021 WHILE NOW I CAN RECEIVE NO PRESENTS EXCEPT FROM MY HUSBAND I CAN NEVER DANCE EXCEPT WITH MY HUSBAND OH YOU WRETCHED DWARF I WILL NEVER NEVER FORGIVE YOU IN SPITE OF HER FIERCE WORDS NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN BARBAIK HOW TO PUT HER PRIDE IN HER POCKET WHEN IT SUITED HER
1116-132851-0022 AND AFTER RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING SHE BEGGED THE BROWNIE TO GET HER A HORSE TO RIDE THERE TO HER GREAT JOY HE CONSENTED BIDDING HER SET OUT FOR THE CITY OF THE DWARFS AND TO TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED
1116-132851-0023 SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN THE HORSE APPEARED AND MOUNTING ON HIS BACK SHE STARTED FOR THE VILLAGE WHERE THE WEDDING WAS TO BE HELD AT FIRST SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THE CHANCE OF A HOLIDAY FROM THE WORK WHICH SHE HATED THAT SHE NOTICED NOTHING
1116-132851-0024 BUT VERY SOON IT STRUCK HER AS ODD THAT AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROADS FULL OF PEOPLE THEY ALL LAUGHED AS THEY LOOKED AT HER HORSE AT LENGTH SHE CAUGHT SOME WORDS UTTERED BY ONE MAN TO ANOTHER WHY THE FARMER'S WIFE HAS SOLD HER HORSE'S TAIL AND TURNED IN HER SADDLE
1116-132851-0025 BUT IT WAS OF NO USE HE DECLINED TO MOVE OUT OF A WALK
1116-132851-0026 SO ONE DAY THE BROWNIE ASKED JEGU IF HE MIGHT BRING HIS FRIENDS TO HAVE SUPPER IN THE GREAT BARN AND WHETHER HE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DANCE THERE OF COURSE JEGU WAS ONLY TOO PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE BROWNIE AND HE ORDERED BARBAIK TO SPREAD HER BEST TABLE CLOTHS IN THE BARN
1116-132851-0027 WHEN ALL WAS READY THE DWARFS IN NEW GREEN SUITS CAME BUSTLING IN VERY HAPPY AND MERRY AND TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE TABLE BUT IN A MOMENT THEY ALL SPRANG UP WITH A CRY AND RAN AWAY SCREAMING FOR BARBAIK HAD PLACED PANS OF HOT COALS UNDER THEIR FEET AND ALL THEIR POOR LITTLE TOES WERE BURNT
1116-132851-0028 YOU WON'T FORGET THAT IN A HURRY SHE SAID SMILING GRIMLY TO HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT THEY WERE BACK AGAIN WITH LARGE POTS OF WATER WHICH THEY POURED ON THE FIRE THEN THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED ROUND IT SINGING WICKED TRAITRESS
19-227-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
19-227-0001 HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
19-227-0002 AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
19-227-0003 BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
19-227-0004 MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
19-227-0005 CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
19-227-0006 FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
19-227-0007 THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
19-227-0008 TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
19-227-0009 ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
19-227-0010 APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
19-227-0011 HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
19-227-0012 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
19-227-0013 SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
19-227-0014 WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
19-227-0015 BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
19-227-0016 AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
19-227-0017 MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
19-227-0018 THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
19-227-0019 BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
19-227-0020 DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
19-227-0021 MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
19-227-0022 AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
19-227-0023 AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
19-227-0024 ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
19-227-0025 FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
19-227-0026 WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
19-227-0027 SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
19-227-0028 AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
19-227-0029 HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
19-227-0030 THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
19-227-0031 SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
19-227-0032 ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
19-227-0033 SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
19-227-0034 COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
19-227-0035 NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
19-227-0036 AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
19-227-0037 JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0038 HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
19-227-0039 AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
19-227-0040 HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
19-227-0041 HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
19-227-0042 HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
19-227-0043 BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
19-227-0044 AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MISTER ALLEN'S ESTATE
19-227-0045 HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
19-227-0046 UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
19-227-0047 AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
19-227-0048 OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
19-227-0049 AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
19-227-0050 CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
19-227-0051 HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
19-227-0052 HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
19-227-0053 THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
19-227-0054 IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
19-227-0055 AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
19-227-0056 MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
19-227-0057 FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
19-227-0058 BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
19-227-0059 AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
19-227-0060 THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
19-227-0061 AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
19-227-0062 I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
19-227-0063 IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
19-227-0064 CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
19-227-0065 HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
19-227-0066 THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
19-227-0067 HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
19-227-0068 NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
19-227-0069 THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0070 AND BELIEVING THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN NO UNWORTHY RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT
19-227-0071 HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
19-227-0072 THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
7312-92432-0000 MAY TEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE MADAME
7312-92432-0001 IN COMPLIANCE WITH YOUR REQUEST I HAVE THE HONOR TO STATE SUCCINCTLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LATE MADAME OSSOLI YOUR DECEASED SISTER DURING HER RESIDENCE IN ROME
7312-92432-0002 IN THE MONTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE ROME AS YOU ARE NO DOUBT AWARE WAS PLACED IN A STATE OF SIEGE BY THE APPROACH OF THE FRENCH ARMY IT WAS FILLED AT THAT TIME WITH EXILES AND FUGITIVES
7312-92432-0003 WHO HAD BEEN CONTENDING FOR YEARS FROM MILAN IN THE NORTH TO PALERMO IN THE SOUTH FOR THE REPUBLICAN CAUSE AND WHEN THE GATES WERE CLOSED IT WAS COMPUTED THAT THERE WERE OF ITALIANS ALONE THIRTEEN THOUSAND REFUGEES WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE CITY
7312-92432-0004 ALL OF WHOM HAD BEEN EXPELLED FROM ADJACENT STATES TILL ROME BECAME THEIR LAST RALLYING POINT AND TO MANY THEIR FINAL RESTING PLACE AMONG THESE WAS TO BE SEEN EVERY VARIETY OF AGE SENTIMENT AND CONDITION
7312-92432-0005 STRIPLINGS AND BLANCHED HEADS WILD VISIONARY ENTHUSIASTS GRAVE HEROIC MEN WHO IN THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM HAD VENTURED ALL AND LOST ALL NOBLES AND BEGGARS BANDITS FELONS AND BRIGANDS GREAT EXCITEMENT NATURALLY EXISTED
7312-92432-0006 AND IN THE GENERAL APPREHENSION WHICH PERVADED ALL CLASSES THAT ACTS OF PERSONAL VIOLENCE AND OUTRAGE WOULD SOON BE COMMITTED THE FOREIGN RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY FOUND THEMSELVES PLACED IN AN ALARMING SITUATION
7312-92432-0007 ON THE THIRTIETH OF APRIL THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE FRENCH AND ROMAN TROOPS AND IN A FEW DAYS SUBSEQUENTLY I VISITED SEVERAL OF MY COUNTRYMEN AT THEIR REQUEST TO CONCERT MEASURES FOR THEIR SAFETY HEARING ON THAT OCCASION AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
7312-92432-0008 AND OF HER SOLITARY MODE OF LIFE I VENTURED TO CALL UPON HER AND OFFER MY SERVICES IN ANY MANNER THAT MIGHT CONDUCE TO HER COMFORT AND SECURITY SHE RECEIVED ME WITH MUCH KINDNESS AND THUS AN ACQUAINTANCE COMMENCED
7312-92432-0009 HER RESIDENCE ON THE PIAZZI BARBERINI BEING CONSIDERED AN INSECURE ABODE
7312-92432-0010 WHICH WAS OCCUPIED BY SEVERAL AMERICAN FAMILIES IN THE ENGAGEMENTS WHICH SUCCEEDED BETWEEN THE ROMAN AND FRENCH TROOPS THE WOUNDED OF THE FORMER WERE BROUGHT INTO THE CITY AND DISPOSED THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT HOSPITALS WHICH WERE UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF SEVERAL LADIES OF HIGH RANK
7312-92432-0011 WHO HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO ASSOCIATIONS THE BETTER TO ENSURE CARE AND ATTENTION TO THOSE UNFORTUNATE MEN MISS FULLER TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THIS NOBLE WORK AND THE GREATER PORTION OF HER TIME DURING THE ENTIRE SIEGE
7312-92432-0012 WHICH WAS PLACED UNDER HER DIRECTION IN ATTENDANCE UPON ITS INMATES THE WEATHER WAS INTENSELY HOT HER HEALTH WAS FEEBLE AND DELICATE THE DEAD AND DYING WERE AROUND HER IN EVERY STAGE OF PAIN AND HORROR BUT SHE NEVER SHRANK FROM THE DUTY SHE HAD ASSUMED
7312-92432-0013 HER HEART AND SOUL WERE IN THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THOSE MEN HAD FOUGHT AND ALL WAS DONE THAT WOMAN COULD DO TO COMFORT THEM IN THEIR SUFFERINGS I HAVE SEEN THE EYES OF THE DYING AS SHE MOVED AMONG THEM EXTENDED ON OPPOSITE BEDS MEET IN COMMENDATION OF HER UNIVERSAL KINDNESS
7312-92432-0014 AND I HAVE HEARD MANY OF THOSE WHO RECOVERED SPEAK WITH ALL THE PASSIONATE FERVOR OF THE ITALIAN NATURE
7312-92432-0015 THROUGHOUT THEIR LONG ILLNESS FULFILLED ALL THE OFFICES OF LOVE AND AFFECTION MAZZINI THE CHIEF OF THE TRIUMVIRATE WHO BETTER THAN ANY MAN IN ROME KNEW HER WORTH OFTEN EXPRESSED TO ME HIS ADMIRATION OF HER HIGH CHARACTER AND THE PRINCESS BELGIOJOSO
7312-92432-0016 TO WHOM WAS ASSIGNED THE CHARGE OF THE PAPAL PALACE ON THE QUIRINAL WHICH WAS CONVERTED ON THIS OCCASION INTO A HOSPITAL WAS ENTHUSIASTIC IN HER PRAISE AND IN A LETTER WHICH I RECEIVED NOT LONG SINCE FROM THIS LADY
7312-92432-0017 WHO WAS GAINING THE BREAD OF AN EXILE BY TEACHING LANGUAGES IN CONSTANTINOPLE SHE ALLUDES WITH MUCH FEELING TO THE SUPPORT AFFORDED BY MISS FULLER TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ITALY HERE IN ROME SHE IS STILL SPOKEN OF IN TERMS OF REGARD AND ENDEARMENT
7312-92432-0018 AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER DEATH WAS RECEIVED WITH A DEGREE OF SORROW NOT OFTEN BESTOWED UPON A FOREIGNER ESPECIALLY ONE OF A DIFFERENT FAITH ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE
7312-92432-0019 SHELLS AND GRENADES FALLING IN EVERY PART OF THE CITY IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRTIETH I RECEIVED A BRIEF NOTE FROM MISS FULLER REQUESTING ME TO CALL AT HER RESIDENCE I DID SO WITHOUT DELAY AND FOUND HER LYING ON A SOFA PALE AND TREMBLING EVIDENTLY MUCH EXHAUSTED
7312-92432-0020 SHE INFORMED ME THAT SHE HAD SENT FOR ME TO PLACE IN MY HAND A PACKET OF IMPORTANT PAPERS WHICH SHE WISHED ME TO KEEP FOR THE PRESENT AND IN THE EVENT OF HER DEATH TO TRANSMIT IT TO HER FRIENDS IN THE UNITED STATES SHE THEN STATED THAT SHE WAS MARRIED TO MARQUIS OSSOLI
7312-92432-0021 WHO WAS IN COMMAND OF A BATTERY ON THE PINCIAN HILL THAT BEING THE HIGHEST AND MOST EXPOSED POSITION IN ROME AND DIRECTLY IN THE LINE OF BOMBS FROM THE FRENCH CAMP IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED SHE SAID THAT HE COULD ESCAPE THE DANGERS OF ANOTHER NIGHT SUCH AS THE LAST
7312-92432-0022 AND THEREFORE IT WAS HER INTENTION TO REMAIN WITH HIM AND SHARE HIS FATE AT THE AVE MARIA SHE ADDED HE WOULD COME FOR HER AND THEY WOULD PROCEED TOGETHER TO HIS POST THE PACKET WHICH SHE PLACED IN MY POSSESSION CONTAINED SHE SAID THE CERTIFICATES OF HER MARRIAGE
7312-92432-0023 AND OF THE BIRTH AND BAPTISM OF HER CHILD AFTER A FEW WORDS MORE I TOOK MY DEPARTURE THE HOUR SHE NAMED HAVING NEARLY ARRIVED AT THE PORTER'S LODGE I MET THE MARQUIS OSSOLI
7312-92432-0024 HAPPILY THE CANNONADING WAS NOT RENEWED THAT NIGHT AND AT DAWN OF DAY SHE RETURNED TO HER APARTMENTS WITH HER HUSBAND BY HER SIDE ON THAT DAY THE FRENCH ARMY ENTERED ROME AND THE GATES BEING OPENED MADAME OSSOLI ACCOMPANIED BY THE MARQUIS

458-126294-0000 FUNDEVOGEL THERE WAS ONCE A FORESTER WHO WENT INTO THE FOREST TO HUNT AND AS HE ENTERED IT HE HEARD A SOUND OF SCREAMING AS IF A LITTLE CHILD WERE THERE HE FOLLOWED THE SOUND AND AT LAST CAME TO A HIGH TREE AND AT THE TOP OF THIS A LITTLE CHILD WAS SITTING
458-126294-0001 FOR THE MOTHER HAD FALLEN ASLEEP UNDER THE TREE WITH THE CHILD

458-126294-0017 YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
458-126294-0018 AND THE COOK WADDLING AFTER THEM THEN SAID LINA FUNDEVOGEL NEVER LEAVE ME AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU THEN SAID FUNDEVOGEL NEITHER NOW NOR EVER SAID LINA BE A FISHPOND AND I WILL BE THE DUCK UPON IT
458-126305-0000 THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE
458-126305-0001 AND YET HE AND HIS WIFE DID SO WISH TO HAVE ONE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HER LISTEN I HAVE A GOOD IDEA THERE IS OUR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER HE SHALL MAKE US A WOODEN CALF AND PAINT IT BROWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER AND IN TIME
458-126305-0002 IT WILL CERTAINLY GET BIG AND BE A COW THE WOMAN ALSO LIKED THE IDEA AND THEIR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER CUT AND PLANED THE CALF AND PAINTED IT AS IT OUGHT TO BE AND MADE IT WITH ITS HEAD HANGING DOWN AS IF IT WERE EATING NEXT MORNING WHEN THE COWS WERE BEING DRIVEN OUT
458-126305-0003 THE LITTLE PEASANT CALLED THE COW HERD IN AND SAID LOOK I HAVE A LITTLE CALF THERE BUT IT IS STILL SMALL AND HAS TO BE CARRIED THE COW HERD SAID ALL RIGHT AND TOOK IT IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED IT TO THE PASTURE AND SET IT AMONG THE GRASS
458-126305-0004 THE LITTLE CALF ALWAYS REMAINED STANDING LIKE ONE WHICH WAS EATING AND THE COW HERD SAID IT WILL SOON RUN BY ITSELF JUST LOOK HOW IT EATS ALREADY AT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DRIVE THE HERD HOME AGAIN HE SAID TO THE CALF
458-126305-0005 IF YOU CAN STAND THERE AND EAT YOUR FILL YOU CAN ALSO GO ON YOUR FOUR LEGS I DON'T CARE TO DRAG YOU HOME AGAIN IN MY ARMS
458-126305-0006 AND WHEN THE COW HERD DROVE THE COWS THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND THE CALF WAS MISSING HE INQUIRED WHERE IT WAS THE COW HERD ANSWERED IT IS STILL STANDING OUT THERE EATING IT WOULD NOT STOP AND COME WITH US BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID
458-126305-0007 OH BUT I MUST HAVE MY BEAST BACK AGAIN THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE MEADOW TOGETHER BUT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN THE CALF AND IT WAS GONE THE COW HERD SAID IT MUST HAVE RUN AWAY THE PEASANT HOWEVER SAID DON'T TELL ME THAT
458-126305-0008 AND LED THE COW HERD BEFORE THE MAYOR WHO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS CONDEMNED HIM TO GIVE THE PEASANT A COW FOR THE CALF WHICH HAD RUN AWAY AND NOW THE LITTLE PEASANT AND HIS WIFE HAD THE COW FOR WHICH THEY HAD SO LONG WISHED AND THEY WERE HEARTILY GLAD
458-126305-0009 BUT THEY HAD NO FOOD FOR IT AND COULD GIVE IT NOTHING TO EAT SO IT SOON HAD TO BE KILLED THEY SALTED THE FLESH AND THE PEASANT WENT INTO THE TOWN AND WANTED TO SELL THE SKIN THERE SO THAT HE MIGHT BUY A NEW CALF WITH THE PROCEEDS ON THE WAY HE PASSED BY A MILL
458-126305-0010 AND THERE SAT A RAVEN WITH BROKEN WINGS AND OUT OF PITY HE TOOK HIM AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE SKIN BUT AS THE WEATHER GREW SO BAD AND THERE WAS A STORM OF RAIN AND WIND HE COULD GO NO FARTHER AND TURNED BACK TO THE MILL AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
458-126305-0011 THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE AND SAID TO THE PEASANT LAY YOURSELF ON THE STRAW THERE AND GAVE HIM A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE THE PEASANT ATE IT AND LAY DOWN WITH HIS SKIN BESIDE HIM AND THE WOMAN THOUGHT HE IS TIRED AND HAS GONE TO SLEEP
458-126305-0012 IN THE MEANTIME CAME THE PARSON THE MILLER'S WIFE RECEIVED HIM WELL AND SAID MY HUSBAND IS OUT SO WE WILL HAVE A FEAST THE PEASANT LISTENED AND WHEN HE HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT FEASTING HE WAS VEXED THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO MAKE SHIFT WITH A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE
458-126305-0013 THEN THE WOMAN SERVED UP FOUR DIFFERENT THINGS ROAST MEAT SALAD CAKES AND WINE JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO SIT DOWN AND EAT THERE WAS A KNOCKING OUTSIDE THE WOMAN SAID OH HEAVENS IT IS MY HUSBAND SHE QUICKLY HID THE ROAST MEAT INSIDE THE TILED STOVE
458-126305-0014 THE WINE UNDER THE PILLOW THE SALAD ON THE BED THE CAKES UNDER IT AND THE PARSON IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER HUSBAND AND SAID THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE BACK AGAIN
458-126305-0015 THERE IS SUCH A STORM IT LOOKS AS IF THE WORLD WERE COMING TO AN END THE MILLER SAW THE PEASANT LYING ON THE STRAW AND ASKED WHAT IS THAT FELLOW DOING THERE AH SAID THE WIFE THE POOR KNAVE CAME IN THE STORM AND RAIN AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
458-126305-0016 THE MAN SAID I HAVE NO OBJECTION BUT BE QUICK AND GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT THE WOMAN SAID BUT I HAVE NOTHING BUT BREAD AND CHEESE I AM CONTENTED WITH ANYTHING REPLIED THE HUSBAND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED BREAD AND CHEESE WILL DO AND LOOKED AT THE PEASANT AND SAID
458-126305-0017 COME AND EAT SOME MORE WITH ME THE PEASANT DID NOT REQUIRE TO BE INVITED TWICE BUT GOT UP AND ATE AFTER THIS THE MILLER SAW THE SKIN IN WHICH THE RAVEN WAS LYING ON THE GROUND AND ASKED WHAT HAVE YOU THERE THE PEASANT ANSWERED I HAVE A SOOTHSAYER INSIDE IT
458-126305-0018 CAN HE FORETELL ANYTHING TO ME SAID THE MILLER WHY NOT ANSWERED THE PEASANT BUT HE ONLY SAYS FOUR THINGS AND THE FIFTH HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF THE MILLER WAS CURIOUS AND SAID
458-126305-0019 AND WENT THITHER AND FOUND THE ROAST MEAT
458-126305-0020 THIRDLY HE SAYS THAT THERE IS SOME SALAD ON THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND WENT THERE AND FOUND THE SALAD
458-126305-0021 FOURTHLY HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE SOME CAKES UNDER THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND LOOKED THERE AND FOUND THE CAKES AND NOW THE TWO SAT DOWN TO THE TABLE TOGETHER BUT THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AND WENT TO BED AND TOOK ALL THE KEYS WITH HER
458-126305-0022 THE MILLER WOULD HAVE LIKED MUCH TO KNOW THE FIFTH BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID FIRST WE WILL QUICKLY EAT THE FOUR THINGS FOR THE FIFTH IS SOMETHING BAD SO THEY ATE AND AFTER THAT THEY BARGAINED HOW MUCH THE MILLER WAS TO GIVE FOR THE FIFTH PROPHECY
458-126305-0023 UNTIL THEY AGREED ON THREE HUNDRED TALERS THEN THE PEASANT ONCE MORE PINCHED THE RAVEN'S HEAD TILL HE CROAKED LOUDLY THE MILLER ASKED WHAT DID HE SAY THE PEASANT REPLIED HE SAYS THAT THE DEVIL IS HIDING OUTSIDE THERE IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THE MILLER SAID
458-126305-0024 THE DEVIL MUST GO OUT AND OPENED THE HOUSE DOOR THEN THE WOMAN WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP THE KEYS AND THE PEASANT UNLOCKED THE CLOSET THE PARSON RAN OUT AS FAST AS HE COULD AND THE MILLER SAID IT WAS TRUE I SAW THE BLACK RASCAL WITH MY OWN EYES
458-126305-0025 THE PEASANT HOWEVER MADE OFF NEXT MORNING BY DAYBREAK WITH THE THREE HUNDRED TALERS AT HOME THE SMALL PEASANT GRADUALLY LAUNCHED OUT HE BUILT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND THE PEASANTS SAID THE SMALL PEASANT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TO THE PLACE WHERE GOLDEN SNOW FALLS
458-126305-0026 AND PEOPLE CARRY THE GOLD HOME IN SHOVELS THEN THE SMALL PEASANT WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAYOR AND BIDDEN TO SAY FROM WHENCE HIS WEALTH CAME HE ANSWERED I SOLD MY COW'S SKIN IN THE TOWN FOR THREE HUNDRED TALERS WHEN THE PEASANTS HEARD THAT THEY TOO WISHED TO ENJOY THIS GREAT PROFIT
458-126305-0027 AND RAN HOME KILLED ALL THEIR COWS AND STRIPPED OFF THEIR SKINS IN ORDER TO SELL THEM IN THE TOWN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE THE MAYOR HOWEVER SAID BUT MY SERVANT MUST GO FIRST
458-126305-0028 AND WHEN THE OTHERS CAME HE DID NOT GIVE THEM SO MUCH AND SAID WHAT CAN I DO WITH ALL THESE SKINS THEN THE PEASANTS WERE VEXED THAT THE SMALL PEASANT SHOULD HAVE THUS OUTWITTED THEM WANTED TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON HIM AND ACCUSED HIM OF THIS TREACHERY BEFORE THE MAYOR
458-126305-0029 THE INNOCENT LITTLE PEASANT WAS UNANIMOUSLY SENTENCED TO DEATH AND WAS TO BE ROLLED INTO THE WATER IN A BARREL PIERCED FULL OF HOLES HE WAS LED FORTH AND A PRIEST WAS BROUGHT WHO WAS TO SAY A MASS FOR HIS SOUL
458-126305-0030 THE OTHERS WERE ALL OBLIGED TO RETIRE TO A DISTANCE AND WHEN THE PEASANT LOOKED AT THE PRIEST HE RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE MILLER'S WIFE HE SAID TO HIM I SET YOU FREE FROM THE CLOSET SET ME FREE FROM THE BARREL AT THIS SAME MOMENT UP CAME
458-126305-0031 WITH A FLOCK OF SHEEP THE VERY SHEPHERD WHOM THE PEASANT KNEW HAD LONG BEEN WISHING TO BE MAYOR
458-126305-0032 NO I WILL NOT DO IT IF THE WHOLE WORLD INSISTS ON IT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD HEARING THAT CAME UP TO HIM AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WILL NOT DO THE PEASANT SAID THEY WANT TO MAKE ME MAYOR
458-126305-0033 MYSELF IN THE BARREL BUT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD SAID
458-126305-0034 I WOULD GET INTO THE BARREL AT ONCE
458-126305-0035 YOU WILL BE MAYOR THE SHEPHERD WAS WILLING AND GOT IN AND THE PEASANT SHUT THE TOP DOWN ON HIM
458-126305-0036 THE PARSON WENT TO THE CROWD AND DECLARED THAT THE MASS HAD BEEN SAID THEN THEY CAME AND ROLLED THE BARREL TOWARDS THE WATER WHEN THE BARREL BEGAN TO ROLL THE SHEPHERD CRIED I AM QUITE WILLING TO BE MAYOR THEY BELIEVED NO OTHERWISE
458-126305-0037 THAN THAT IT WAS THE PEASANT WHO WAS SAYING THIS AND ANSWERED THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND BUT FIRST YOU SHALL LOOK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE DOWN BELOW THERE AND THEY ROLLED THE BARREL DOWN INTO THE WATER AFTER THAT THE PEASANTS WENT HOME
458-126305-0038 AND AS THEY WERE ENTERING THE VILLAGE THE SMALL PEASANT ALSO CAME QUIETLY IN DRIVING A FLOCK OF SHEEP AND LOOKING QUITE CONTENTED THEN THE PEASANTS WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID PEASANT FROM WHENCE DO YOU COME HAVE YOU COME OUT OF THE WATER YES TRULY REPLIED THE PEASANT
458-126305-0039 I SANK DEEP DEEP DOWN UNTIL AT LAST I GOT TO THE BOTTOM
458-126305-0040 OUT OF THE BARREL AND CREPT OUT AND THERE WERE PRETTY MEADOWS ON WHICH A NUMBER OF LAMBS WERE FEEDING AND FROM THENCE I BROUGHT THIS FLOCK AWAY WITH ME SAID THE PEASANTS ARE THERE ANY MORE THERE
458-126305-0041 THEN THE PEASANTS MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT THEY TOO WOULD FETCH SOME SHEEP FOR THEMSELVES A FLOCK APIECE BUT THE MAYOR SAID I COME FIRST SO THEY WENT TO THE WATER TOGETHER
458-126305-0042 WHEREUPON THE PEASANTS CRIED WE ALREADY SEE THE SHEEP DOWN BELOW THE MAYOR PRESSED FORWARD AND SAID I WILL GO DOWN FIRST AND LOOK ABOUT ME AND IF THINGS PROMISE WELL I'LL CALL YOU
201-127786-0000 HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
201-127786-0001 BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
201-127786-0002 ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
201-127786-0003 A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
201-127786-0004 CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
201-127786-0005 WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
201-127786-0006 AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
201-127786-0007 BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
201-127786-0008 THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
201-127786-0009 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0010 HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
201-127786-0011 YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0012 WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
201-127786-0013 IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
201-127786-0014 BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
201-127786-0015 IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
201-127786-0016 THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
201-127786-0017 FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
201-127786-0018 I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
201-127786-0019 AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
201-127786-0020 AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
201-127786-0021 LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
201-127786-0022 FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
201-127786-0023 THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
201-127786-0024 AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
201-127786-0025 AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
201-127786-0026 ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
201-127786-0027 THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
201-127786-0028 FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
201-127786-0029 AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
201-127786-0030 FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
201-127786-0031 FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0032 AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
201-127786-0033 AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
201-127786-0034 AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
201-127786-0035 AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
201-127786-0036 AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
201-127786-0037 OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
201-127786-0038 I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
201-127786-0039 PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
201-127786-0040 AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
201-127786-0041 I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
201-127786-0042 WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
201-127786-0043 AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
201-127786-0044 BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
201-127786-0045 BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
201-127786-0046 I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
201-127786-0047 AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
201-127786-0048 I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
201-127786-0049 AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
201-127786-0050 FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
201-127786-0051 AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
201-127786-0052 HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
201-127786-0053 PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
201-127786-0054 THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
201-127786-0055 CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
201-127786-0056 AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
201-127786-0057 WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
201-127786-0058 AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
201-127786-0059 AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
201-127786-0060 I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
201-127786-0061 WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
201-127786-0062 I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
201-127786-0063 AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
201-127786-0064 IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
201-127786-0065 DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
201-127786-0066 AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
201-127786-0067 AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
201-127786-0068 AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
201-127786-0069 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0070 IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
201-127786-0071 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0072 ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
201-127786-0073 REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
201-127786-0074 TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
201-127786-0075 INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
201-127786-0076 AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
201-127786-0077 BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
201-127786-0078 HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
201-127786-0079 I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
201-127786-0080 AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
201-127786-0081 BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
6272-70171-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ROSVILLE AND FOUND MISTER MORGESON WAITING FOR US WITH HIS CARRIAGE AT THE STATION FROM ITS OPEN SIDES
6272-70171-0001 I LOOKED OUT ON A TRANQUIL AGREEABLE LANDSCAPE THERE WAS NOTHING SALINE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE WESTERN BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN OUR FACES HAD AN EARTHY SCENT WITH FLUCTUATING STREAMS OF ODORS FROM TREES AND FLOWERS
6272-70171-0002 AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN COUSIN CHARLES POINTED TO THE ACADEMY WHICH STOOD AT THE HEAD OF A GREEN PRETTY HOUSES STOOD ROUND IT AND STREETS BRANCHED FROM IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FLOWER GARDENS SHRUBBERY AND TREES WERE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE
6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
6272-70171-0004 AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
6272-70171-0005 AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
6272-70171-0006 WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
6272-70171-0007 SO FASTIDIOUSLY NEAT IT GLITTERED WITH GLASS AND FRENCH CHINA COUSIN CHARLES SENT AWAY A GLASS AND A PLATE FROWNING AT THE GIRL WHO WAITED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECK OR A FLAW IN THEM THE VIANDS WERE AS PRETTY AS THE DISHES
6272-70171-0008 THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
6272-70171-0009 I COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THE WHOLE OF IT INTO MY MOUTH STILL HUNGRY I OBSERVED THAT COUSIN CHARLES AND ALICE HAD FINISHED AND THOUGH SHE SHOOK HER SPOON IN THE CUP FEIGNING TO CONTINUE AND HE SNIPPED CRUMBS IN HIS PLATE
6272-70171-0010 I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
6272-70171-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE STREAM OF LIGHT OVER THE CARPET I THOUGHT IT SOMBER AND OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COTTAGE EXTERIOR
6272-70171-0012 THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
6272-70171-0013 DARK AND DELICATE BUT TO LOOK AT IT MADE ME SHIVER MOTHER CAME TOWARD US PLEADING FATIGUE AS AN EXCUSE FOR RETIRING AND COUSIN CHARLES CALLED COUSIN ALICE WHO WENT WITH US TO OUR ROOM IN THE MORNING SHE SAID
6272-70171-0014 WE SHOULD SEE HER THREE CHILDREN SHE NEVER LEFT THEM SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF THEIR BEING ILL ALSO TELLING MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD DO ALL IN HER POWER TO MAKE MY STAY IN ROSVILLE PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE AS A MOTHER
6272-70171-0015 SHE COULD APPRECIATE HER ANXIETY AND SADNESS IN LEAVING ME MOTHER THANKED HER WARMLY AND WAS SURE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY BUT I HAD AN INWARD MISGIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT I HEAR EDWARD SAID ALICE GOOD NIGHT
6272-70171-0016 PRESENTLY A GIRL THE SAME WHO HAD TAKEN OUR BONNETS CAME IN WITH A PITCHER OF WARM WATER AND A PLATE OF SODA BISCUIT SHE DIRECTED US WHERE TO FIND THE APPAREL SHE HAD NICELY SMOOTHED AND FOLDED TOOK OFF THE HANDSOME COUNTERPANE AND THE PILLOWS TRIMMED WITH LACE
6272-70171-0017 PUTTING OTHERS OF A PLAINER MAKE IN THEIR PLACES SHOOK DOWN THE WINDOW CURTAINS ASKED US IF WE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING MORE AND QUIETLY DISAPPEARED I OFFERED MOTHER THE WARM WATER AND APPROPRIATED THE BISCUITS THERE WERE SIX I ATE EVERY ONE
6272-70171-0018 UNDRESSING MEANWHILE AND SURVEYING THE APARTMENT CASSY MISSUS MORGESON IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER YES I SAID HUSKILY FOR THE DRY BISCUIT CHOKED ME WHAT WOULD TEMPERANCE AND HEPSEY SAY TO THIS
6272-70171-0019 I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
6272-70171-0020 AND HERE IS A DAMASK NAPKIN FASTENED TO THE WALL BEHIND THE WASHSTAND AND EVERYTHING STANDS ON A MAT I WONDER IF THIS IS TO BE MY ROOM IT IS PROBABLY THE CHAMBER FOR VISITORS WHY
6272-70171-0021 IT WAS BYRON AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TILL I CAME TO DON JUAN I READ IT THROUGH
6272-70171-0022 WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
6272-70171-0023 AND THEIR MOTHER WAS TENDING AND WATCHING THEM THE OLDEST WAS EIGHT YEARS THE YOUNGEST THREE MONTHS COUSIN ALICE GAVE US DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR TASTES AND HABITS DWELLING WITH EMPHASIS ON THOSE OF THE BABY
6272-70171-0024 I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
6272-70171-0025 PUT LITTLE EDWARD IN HIS CHAIR AND BREAKFAST BEGAN MISSUS MORGESON SAID CHARLES THE HORSES WILL BE READY TO TAKE YOU ROUND ROSVILLE WE WILL CALL ON DOCTOR PRICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE KIND OF MASTER CASSANDRA WILL HAVE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT RECEIVING A NEW PUPIL
6272-70171-0026 I SAID MOTHER TRIED IN VAIN TO LOOK HARD HEARTED AND TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME BUT SHE LOST HER APPETITE WITH THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ME WHICH THE MENTION OF DOCTOR PRICE BROUGHT HOME
6272-70171-0027 THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
6272-70171-0028 COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
6272-70171-0029 I NOTICED HOW ELEGANT THEIR TABLE APPOINTMENTS WERE AND I SHALL BUY NEW CHINA IN BOSTON TO MORROW I WISH HEPSEY WOULD NOT LOAD OUR TABLE AS SHE DOES HEPSEY IS A GOOD WOMAN MOTHER DO GIVE MY LOVE TO HER NOW THAT I THINK OF IT
6272-70171-0030 SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING UP SOME NICE DISH TELL HER I REMEMBER IT WILL YOU WHEN COUSIN CHARLES PUT US INTO THE CARRIAGE AND HOISTED LITTLE EDWARD ON THE FRONT SEAT MOTHER NOTICED THAT TWO MEN HELD THE HORSES AND THAT THEY WERE NOT THE SAME HE HAD DRIVEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
6272-70171-0031 SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
6272-70171-0032 THAT STOOD ON THEIR HIND LEGS AS OFTEN AS THAT POSITION WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER OF GETTING ON FOR THEY EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE GUIDED BY A FIRM HAND EDWARD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR
6272-70171-0033 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIS FATHER SMILE ON HIM THESE ARE FINE BRUTES HE SAID NOT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO MY MARE NELL ALICE IS AFRAID OF HER BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CASSANDRA
6272-70171-0034 LEAPING SO HIGH THAT THE HARNESS SEEMED RATTLING FROM THEIR BACKS HE STRUCK THEM AND SAID GO ON NOW GO ON DEVILS THERE WAS NO FURTHER TROUBLE HE ENCOURAGED MOTHER NOT TO BE AFRAID LOOKING KEENLY AT ME
6272-70171-0035 AND THE SCHOLARS SOME SIXTY BOYS AND GIRLS WERE COMING DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE HALL TO GO INTO THE ROOMS EACH SIDE OF A GREAT DOOR DOCTOR PRICE WAS BEHIND THEM HE STOPPED WHEN HE SAW US AN INTRODUCTION TOOK PLACE AND HE INQUIRED FOR DOCTOR SNELL
6272-70171-0036 AS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND LOCKE MORGESON SOUNDED FAMILIARLY HE SAID A MEMBER OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY NAMED SOMERS HAD MARRIED A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME HE REMEMBERED IT FROM AN OLD IVORY MINIATURE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SHOWN HIM
6272-70171-0037 TELLING HIM IT WAS THE LIKENESS OF HER COUSIN RACHEL'S HUSBAND I REPLIED WE KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER HAD MARRIED A RACHEL SOMERS COUSIN CHARLES WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE VEXED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
6272-70171-0038 AND WE FOLLOWED HIM TO HER SCHOOL ROOM I WAS AT ONCE INTERESTED AND IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF MY TEACHER THAT WAS TO BE SHE WAS A DIGNIFIED KIND LOOKING WOMAN WHO ASKED ME A FEW QUESTIONS IN SUCH A PLEASANT DIRECT MANNER
6272-70171-0039 THAT I FRANKLY TOLD HER I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD VERY IGNORANT AND AVERSE FROM LEARNING BUT I DID NOT SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY BESIDE HERSELF TO HEAR NOW SAID MOTHER WHEN WE CAME AWAY
6272-70171-0040 THINK HOW MUCH GREATER YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE THAN MINE HAVE EVER BEEN HOW MISERABLE WAS MY YOUTH IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT CULTIVATION I HAVE NO WISH THAT WAY
6272-70171-0041 AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN ROSVILLE SHE WENT TO BOSTON THAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON ANXIOUS TO GET SAFELY HOME WITH VERONICA WE PARTED WITH MANY A KISS AND SHAKE OF THE HAND AND LAST WORDS
6272-70191-0000 WE SAT IN STATE TO BE CONDOLED WITH AND WAITED UPON
6272-70191-0001 THOUGH I AM SURE THE PERFORMERS THEREOF HAD SMALL ENCOURAGEMENT VERONICA ALONE WOULD SEE NO ONE HER ROOM WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT INVADED FOR THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THE HOUSE INTO THEIR HANDS ASSISTED BY THAT PART OF THE MORGESONS
6272-70191-0002 WHO WERE TOO DISTANTLY RELATED TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS MOURNERS TO BE SHUT UP WITH US IT WAS PUT UNDER RIGOROUS FUNERAL LAW AND INSPECTED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR THEY SUPERVISED ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0003 HER COURSE WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED MINE WAS IMPOSED UPON ME I REMONSTRATED WITH TEMPERANCE BUT SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL WELL MEANT AND ALWAYS DONE
6272-70191-0004 I ENDURED THE SAME ANNOYANCES OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM RELAYS OF PEOPLE BED TIME ESPECIALLY WAS THEIR OCCASION I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO UNDRESS ALONE I MUST HAVE DRINKS EITHER TO COMPOSE OR STIMULATE
6272-70191-0005 THEY REITERATED THE CHARACTER THE PECULIARITIES THE VIRTUES OF THE MOTHER I HAD LOST WHO COULD NEVER BE REPLACED WHO WAS IN A BETTER WORLD HOWEVER I WAS IN A MEASURE
6272-70191-0006 KEPT FROM MYSELF DURING THIS INTERVAL THE MATTER IS OFTEN SUBSERVIENT TO THE MANNER ARTHUR'S FEELINGS WERE PLAYED UPON ALSO HE WEPT OFTEN CONFIDING TO ME HIS GRIEF AND HIS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
6272-70191-0007 THINGS WOULD GO WELL HE SAID FOR EVERYBODY MUST EXPECT TO DIE THEN THE BIBLE SAYS SO HE INFORMED ME ALSO THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE AN ARCHITECT AND THAT MOTHER LIKED IT HE HAD AN IDEA
6272-70191-0008 WHICH HE HAD IMPARTED TO HER OF AN ARCH IT MUST BE MADE OF BLACK MARBLE WITH GOLD VEINS AND OUGHT TO STAND IN EGYPT WITH THE WORD PANDEMONIUM ON IT THE KITCHEN WAS THE FOCUS OF INTEREST TO HIM
6272-70191-0009 FOR MEALS WERE PREPARED AT ALL HOURS FOR COMERS AND GOERS TEMPERANCE TOLD ME THAT THE MILD AND INDIFFERENT MOURNERS WERE FOND OF GOOD VICTUALS AND SHE THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THAN THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT AWAY
6272-70191-0010 BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO GRIEF STRUCK AUNT MERCE WAS ENGAGED WITH A DRESSMAKER AND WITH THE ORDERS FOR BONNETS AND VEILS SHE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THE MOURNING WITH THE MORGESONS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0011 FOR SHE DERIVED A SIMPLE COMFORT FROM THESE EXTERNAL TOKENS VERONICA REFUSED TO WEAR THE BONNET AND VEIL AND THE REQUIRED BOMBAZINE BOMBAZINE MADE HER FLESH CRAWL WHY SHOULD SHE WEAR IT MOTHER HATED IT TOO
6272-70191-0012 FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORN OUT THE GARMENTS MADE FOR GRAND'THER WARREN SHE'S A BIGGER CHILD THAN EVER TEMPERANCE REMARKED AND MUST HAVE HER WAY
6272-70191-0013 COMING INTO MY ROOM DRESSED FOR THE FUNERAL NO

6272-70191-0015 IS THIS LIKE HER SHE ASKED SHOWING ME A DRAWING HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED IS IT LIKE YES THE IDEA
6272-70191-0016 BUT WHAT A PICTURE SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE MOTHER'S SHADOWY FACE SERENELY LOOKED FROM A HIGH SMALL WINDOW SET IN CLOUDS LIKE THOSE WHICH GATHER OVER THE SUN WHEN IT DRAWS WATER
6272-70191-0017 IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT
6272-70191-0018 KEEP IT BUT DON'T WORK ON IT ANY MORE AND I PUT IT AWAY SHE WAS WAN AND LANGUID BUT COLLECTED I SEE YOU ARE READY SOMEBODY MUST BURY THE DEAD GO
6272-70191-0019 WILL THE HOUSE BE EMPTY YES GOOD I CAN WALK THROUGH IT ONCE MORE THE DEAD MUST BE BURIED THAT IS CERTAIN BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE CERTAIN THAT I MUST BE THE ONE TO DO IT YOU THINK I CAN GO THROUGH WITH IT THEN
6272-70191-0020 I HAVE SET YOUR BEHAVIOR DOWN TO YOUR WILL YOU MAY BE RIGHT PERHAPS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS RIGHT ABOUT ME TOO SHE WAS AGAINST ME SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A TIMIDITY AND APPREHENSION THAT MADE MY HEART BLEED
6272-70191-0021 I THINK WE MIGHT KISS EACH OTHER NOW SHE SAID I OPENED MY ARMS HOLDING HER AGAINST MY BREAST SO TIGHTLY THAT SHE DREW BACK BUT KISSED MY CHEEK GENTLY AND TOOK FROM HER POCKET
6272-70191-0022 A FLACON OF SALTS WHICH SHE FASTENED TO MY BELT BY ITS LITTLE CHAIN AND SAID AGAIN GO BUT RECALLING ME SAID
6272-70191-0023 THE LANDING STAIR WAS FULL OF PEOPLE I LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE KEY THE STAIRS WERE CROWDED ALL MADE WAY FOR ME WITH A SILENT RESPECT AUNT MERCE WHEN SHE SAW ME
6272-70191-0024 PUT HER HAND ON AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE FATHER WHO SAT BY THE COFFIN THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH CONTAIN THE BEAUTIFULLY POETIC IMAGES RELATING TO THE GOING OF MAN TO HIS LONG HOME WERE READ AND TO MY EAR
6272-70191-0025 THEY SEEMED TO FALL ON THE COFFIN IN DULL STRIFE WITH ITS INMATE WHO MUTELY CONTRADICTED THEM A DISCOURSE FOLLOWED WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO HARROW THE FEELINGS TO THE UTMOST ARTHUR BEGAN TO CRY SO NERVOUSLY
6272-70191-0026 THAT SOME CONSIDERATE FRIEND TOOK HIM OUT AND AUNT MERCE WEPT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE GREW FAINT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF ME I GAVE HER THE FLACON OF SALTS WHICH REVIVED HER BUT I FELT AS FATHER LOOKED STERN
6272-70191-0027 AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
6272-70191-0028 WHEN THE HEARSE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FATHER ARTHUR AND I WERE CALLED AND ASSISTED IN OUR OWN CHAISE AS IF WE WERE HELPLESS THE REINS WERE PUT IN FATHER'S HANDS AND THE HORSE WAS LED BEHIND THE HEARSE
6272-70191-0029 AT LAST THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THE LONG PROCESSION BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED A CAT RAN OUT OF A HOUSE AND SCAMPERED ACROSS THE WAY ARTHUR LAUGHED AND FATHER JUMPED NERVOUSLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS LAUGH
6272-70191-0030 THE GRAVEYARD WAS A MILE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE A SANDY PLAIN WHERE A FEW STUNTED PINES TRANSPLANTED FROM THE WOODS NEAR IT STRUGGLED TO KEEP ALIVE AS WE TURNED FROM THE STREET INTO THE LANE WHICH LED TO IT
6272-70191-0031 AND RODE UP A LITTLE HILL WHERE THE SAND WAS SO DEEP THAT IT MUFFLED THE WHEELS AND FEET OF THE HORSES THE WHOLE ROUND OF THE GRAY SKY WAS VISIBLE IT HUNG LOW OVER US I WISHED IT TO DROP AND BLOT OUT THE VAGUE NOTHINGS UNDER IT
6272-70191-0032 WE LEFT THE CARRIAGE AT THE PALINGS AND WALKED UP THE NARROW PATH AMONG THE MOUNDS WHERE EVERY STONE WAS MARKED MORGESON SOME SO OLD THAT THEY WERE STAINED WITH BLOTCHES OF YELLOW MOSS
6272-70191-0033 SLANTING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FOLLY OF INDICATING WHAT WAS NO LONGER BENEATH THEM THE MOUNDS WERE COVERED WITH MATS OF SCANTY TANGLED GRASS WITH HERE AND THERE A RANK SPOT OF GREEN
6272-70191-0034 IT WAS THE CUSTOM AND FATHER TOOK HIS HAT OFF TO THANK HIS FRIENDS FOR THEIR SYMPATHY AND ATTENTION HIS LIPS MOVED BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE THE PROCESSION MOVED DOWN THE PATH AGAIN
6272-70191-0035 ARTHUR'S HAND WAS IN MINE HE STAMPED HIS FEET FIRMLY ON THE SAND AS IF TO BREAK THE OPPRESSIVE SILENCE WHICH NO ONE SEEMED DISPOSED TO DISTURB THE SAME CEREMONIES WERE PERFORMED IN STARTING US HOMEWARD
6272-70191-0036 BUT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE WHEN WE WENT IN THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRADITION HAD BEEN FULFILLED THE NEIGHBORS HAD GONE HOME TO THEIR AVOCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER ALL SPECULATION ON THE DEGREE OF OUR GRIEF
6272-70191-0037 OR OUR INDIFFERENCE WAS SETTLED WE COULD TAKE OFF OUR MOURNING GARMENTS AND OUR MOURNING COUNTENANCE NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE OR WE COULD GIVE WAY TO THAT ANGUISH WE ARE AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO SHOW EXCEPT BEFORE THE ONE

1578-140049-0024 THE LAMP IT WAS TACITLY FELT BY EVERYBODY WAS DIGNIFYING THE PARTY AND PROVIDING SUFFICIENT ENTERTAINMENT SIMPLY BY ITS PRESENCE BEING FULLY AS SATISFACTORY IN ITS WAY AS A PIANOLA OR A STRING BAND I WISH FATHER COULD SEE IT SAID CLARA BELLE LOYALLY
1578-140049-0025 MURMURED SUSAN SAGACIOUSLY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR REBECCA DRAGGED HERSELF RELUCTANTLY AWAY FROM THE ENCHANTING SCENE

1578-140049-0036 THERE CAN'T BE ANYTHING WRONG THIS TIME REBECCA ANSWERED CONFIDENTLY EMMA JANE SOLD HER CAKES TO HER OWN RELATIONS AND TO UNCLE JERRY COBB AND I WENT FIRST TO THOSE NEW TENEMENTS NEAR THE LUMBER MILL AND THEN TO THE LADDS MISTER LADD BOUGHT ALL WE HAD AND MADE US PROMISE TO KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL THE PREMIUM CAME
1578-140049-0037 REBECCA'S HAIR WAS LOOSENED AND FALLING OVER HER FOREHEAD IN RUFFLED WAVES HER EYES WERE BRILLIANT HER CHEEKS CRIMSON THERE WAS A HINT OF EVERYTHING IN THE GIRL'S FACE OF SENSITIVENESS AND DELICACY AS WELL AS OF ARDOR
1578-140049-0038 THERE WAS THE SWEETNESS OF THE MAYFLOWER AND THE STRENGTH OF THE YOUNG OAK BUT ONE COULD EASILY DIVINE THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE SOULS BY NATURE PITCHED TOO HIGH BY SUFFERING PLUNGED TOO LOW

4137-11702-0052 THAT SAID CORONEL SIMPLY IS MUCH MORE SURPRISING MERRIWIG HOWEVER WAS NOT SO SURE OF THAT HE LIKED THE LOOK OF CORONEL HE LIKED HIS MANNER
4137-11702-0053 AND HE SAW AT ONCE THAT HE KNEW A GOOD STORY WHEN HE HEARD ONE OF COURSE HE SAID YOU'LL HAVE TO WIN HER ANYTHING YOUR MAJESTY SETS ME TO DO IT'S AS WELL HE ADDED WITH A DISARMING SMILE

4137-11702-0055 PERHAPS YOUR PRINCE UDO WOULD CARE TO BE A COMPETITOR TOO HYACINTH AND CORONEL INTERCHANGED A SMILE ALAS FATHER SHE SAID HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS NOT ATTRACTED BY MY POOR CHARMS
4137-11702-0056 WAIT TILL HE HAS SEEN THEM MY DEAR SAID MERRIWIG WITH A CHUCKLE HE HAS SEEN THEM FATHER WHAT YOU INVITED HIM HERE
4137-11702-0057 HE CAME TO STAY WITH YOU AND HE NEVER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PUT IN CORONEL HAS GIVEN HIS AFFECTIONS TO ANOTHER AHA SO THAT'S THE SECRET NOW I WONDER IF I CAN GUESS WHO SHE IS
4137-11702-0058 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE PRINCESS ELVIRA OF TREGONG I KNOW HIS FATHER HAD HOPES IN THAT DIRECTION HYACINTH LOOKED ROUND AT CORONEL AS IF APPEALING FOR HIS SUPPORT HE TOOK A STEP TOWARDS HER
4137-11702-0059 NO IT'S NOT THE PRINCESS ELVIRA SAID HYACINTH A LITTLE NERVOUSLY THE KING LAUGHED GOOD HUMOUREDLY AH WELL YOU MUST TELL ME HE SAID
4137-11702-0060 HYACINTH PUT OUT HER HAND AND CORONEL PRESSED IT ENCOURAGINGLY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE UDO SHE SAID
8468-295198-0000 AND THIS WAS THE CASE WITH MOTHER MAGPIE SHE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS BUT HER OWN UP AND DOWN HERE AND THERE EVERYWHERE BUT IN HER OWN NEST KNOWING EVERYONE'S AFFAIRS TELLING WHAT EVERYBODY HAD BEEN DOING OR OUGHT TO DO
8468-295198-0001 AND READY TO CAST HER ADVICE GRATIS AT EVERY BIRD AND BEAST OF THE WOODS NOW SHE BUSTLED UP TO THE PARSONAGE AT THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE TO TELL OLD PARSON TOO WHIT WHAT SHE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO PREACH FOR HIS NEXT SERMON AND HOW DREADFUL THE MORALS OF THE PARISH WERE BECOMING
8468-295198-0002 THEN HAVING PERFECTLY BEWILDERED THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS SLEEPY OF A MONDAY MORNING MOTHER MAGPIE WOULD TAKE A PEEP INTO MISSUS ORIOLE'S NEST SIT CHATTERING ON A BOUGH ABOVE AND POUR FORTH FLOODS OF ADVICE
8468-295198-0003 DEPEND UPON IT MY DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE WOULD SAY THAT THIS WAY OF BUILDING YOUR NEST SWINGING LIKE AN OLD EMPTY STOCKING FROM A BOUGH ISN'T AT ALL THE THING I NEVER BUILT ONE SO IN MY LIFE AND I NEVER HAVE HEADACHES
8468-295198-0004 NOW YOU COMPLAIN ALWAYS THAT YOUR HEAD ACHES WHENEVER I CALL UPON YOU IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THIS WAY OF SWINGING AND SWAYING ABOUT IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER BUT MY DEAR
8468-295198-0005 PIPED MISSUS ORIOLE TIMIDLY THE ORIOLES ALWAYS HAVE BUILT IN THIS MANNER AND IT SUITS OUR CONSTITUTION A FIDDLE ON YOUR CONSTITUTION HOW CAN YOU TELL WHAT AGREES WITH YOUR CONSTITUTION UNLESS YOU TRY YOU OWN YOU ARE NOT WELL
8468-295198-0006 YOU ARE SUBJECT TO HEADACHES AND EVERY PHYSICIAN WILL TELL YOU THAT A TILTING MOTION DISORDERS THE STOMACH AND ACTS UPON THE BRAIN ASK OLD DOCTOR KITE I WAS TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT YOUR CASE ONLY YESTERDAY AND SAYS HE MISSUS MAGPIE I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU
8468-295198-0007 BUT MY HUSBAND PREFERS THIS STYLE OF BUILDING THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE ISN'T PROPERLY INSTRUCTED PRAY DID YOU EVER ATTEND DOCTOR KITE'S LECTURES ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NO I HAVE NO TIME TO ATTEND LECTURES WHO WOULD SIT ON THE EGGS
8468-295198-0008 O MISSUS MAGPIE PRAY DON'T SPEAK TO MY HUSBAND HE WILL THINK I'VE BEEN COMPLAINING NO NO HE WON'T LET ME ALONE I UNDERSTAND JUST HOW TO SAY THE THING I'VE ADVISED HUNDREDS OF YOUNG HUSBANDS IN MY DAY AND I NEVER GAVE OFFENCE
8468-295198-0009 I SAY MY DEAR IF YOU WILL PERSIST IN GOSSIPING OVER OUR PRIVATE FAMILY MATTERS WITH THAT OLD MOTHER MAGPIE MY DEAR I DON'T GOSSIP SHE COMES AND BORES ME TO DEATH WITH TALKING AND THEN GOES OFF AND MISTAKES WHAT SHE HAS BEEN SAYING FOR WHAT I SAID
8468-295198-0010 BUT YOU MUST CUT HER I TRY TO ALL I CAN BUT SHE WON'T BE CUT IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A BIRD SWEAR SAID TOMMY ORIOLE TOMMY ORIOLE TO SAY THE TRUTH HAD AS GOOD A HEART AS EVER BEAT UNDER BIRD'S FEATHERS
8468-295198-0011 BUT THEN HE HAD A WEAKNESS FOR CONCERTS AND GENERAL SOCIETY BECAUSE HE WAS HELD TO BE BY ALL ODDS THE HANDSOMEST BIRD IN THE WOODS AND SUNG LIKE AN ANGEL AND SO THE TRUTH WAS HE DIDN'T CONFINE HIMSELF SO MUCH TO THE DOMESTIC NEST AS TOM TITMOUSE OR BILLY WREN
8468-295198-0012 THE FACT IS QUOTH TOMMY I AM A SOCIETY BIRD AND NATURE HAS MARKED OUT FOR ME A COURSE BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE COMMONPLACE AND MY WIFE MUST LEARN TO ACCOMMODATE IF SHE HAS A BRILLIANT HUSBAND
8468-295198-0013 WHOSE SUCCESS GRATIFIES HER AMBITION AND PLACES HER IN A DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC POSITION SHE MUST PAY SOMETHING FOR IT I'M SURE BILLY WREN'S WIFE WOULD GIVE HER VERY BILL TO SEE HER HUSBAND IN THE CIRCLES WHERE I AM QUITE AT HOME TO SAY THE TRUTH
8468-295198-0014 MY WIFE WAS ALL WELL ENOUGH CONTENT TILL OLD MOTHER MAGPIE INTERFERED IT IS QUITE MY DUTY TO TAKE STRONG GROUND AND SHOW THAT I CANNOT BE DICTATED TO
8468-295198-0015 AND SOMETIMES WILL TAKE THE MOST UNREASONABLE COURSES IF A MEDDLESOME MAGPIE GETS HER CLAW INTO THEIR NEST BUT OLD MOTHER MAGPIE HAD NOW GOT A NEW BUSINESS IN HAND IN ANOTHER QUARTER SHE BUSTLED OFF DOWN TO WATER DOCK LANE WHERE AS WE SAID IN A FORMER NARRATIVE
8468-295198-0016 LIVED THE OLD MUSIC TEACHER DOCTOR BULLFROG THE POOR OLD DOCTOR WAS A SIMPLE MINDED GOOD AMIABLE CREATURE WHO HAD PLAYED THE DOUBLE BASS AND LED THE FOREST CHOIR ON ALL PUBLIC OCCASIONS SINCE NOBODY KNOWS WHEN
8468-295198-0017 LATTERLY SOME YOUNGSTERS HAD ARISEN WHO SNEERED AT HIS PERFORMANCES AS BEHIND THE AGE IN FACT SINCE A GREAT CITY HAD GROWN UP IN THE VICINITY OF THE FOREST TRIBES OF WANDERING BOYS BROKE UP THE SIMPLE TASTES AND QUIET HABITS
8468-295198-0018 WHICH OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD ALWAYS KEPT UP IN THOSE PARTS THEY PULLED THE YOUNG CHECKERBERRY BEFORE IT EVEN HAD TIME TO BLOSSOM ROOTED UP THE SASSAFRAS SHRUBS AND GNAWED THEIR ROOTS FIRED OFF GUNS AT THE BIRDS AND ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
8468-295198-0019 WHEN OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG WAS LEADING A CONCERT HAD DASHED IN AND BROKEN UP THE CHOIR BY THROWING STONES THIS WAS NOT THE WORST OF IT THE LITTLE VARLETS HAD A WAY OF JEERING AT THE SIMPLE OLD DOCTOR AND HIS CONCERTS
8468-295198-0020 THAT OLD BULLFROG WAS A BORE AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET UP A NEW STYLE OF MUSIC IN THE PARISH AND TO GIVE THE CHARGE OF IT TO SOME MORE MODERN PERFORMER
8468-295198-0021 POOR OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG KNEW NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER AND WAS DOING HIS SIMPLE BEST IN PEACE WHEN MOTHER MAGPIE CALLED IN UPON HIM ONE MORNING WELL NEIGHBOUR HOW UNREASONABLE PEOPLE ARE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
8468-295198-0022 MADAM SAID DOCTOR BULLFROG WITH ALL THAT ENERGY OF TONE FOR WHICH HE WAS REMARKABLE I DON'T BELIEVE IT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT YOU MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
8468-295198-0023 NO NO MY GOOD FRIEND I NEVER MAKE MISTAKES WHAT I KNOW I KNOW CERTAINLY
8468-295198-0024 AND NANCY NIBBLE WHO ARE MARRIED THIS VERY DAY I KNEW THAT THING SIX WEEKS BEFORE ANY BIRD OR BEAST IN OUR PARTS AND I CAN TELL YOU YOU ARE GOING TO BE SCANDALOUSLY AND UNGRATEFULLY TREATED DOCTOR BULLFROG
8468-295198-0025 BLESS ME WE SHALL ALL BE RUINED SAID MISSUS BULLFROG MY POOR HUSBAND OH AS TO THAT IF YOU TAKE THINGS IN TIME AND LISTEN TO MY ADVICE SAID MOTHER MAGPIE WE MAY YET PULL YOU THROUGH YOU MUST ALTER YOUR STYLE A LITTLE
8468-295198-0026 ADAPT IT TO MODERN TIMES EVERYBODY NOW IS A LITTLE TOUCHED WITH THE OPERATIC FEVER AND THERE'S TOMMY ORIOLE HAS BEEN TO NEW ORLEANS AND BROUGHT BACK A TOUCH OF THE ARTISTIC IF YOU WOULD TRY HIS STYLE A LITTLE SOMETHING TYROLEAN YOU SEE
8468-295198-0027 DEAR MADAM CONSIDER MY VOICE I NEVER COULD HIT THE HIGH NOTES HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ALL PRACTICE TOMMY ORIOLE SAYS SO JUST TRY THE SCALES AS TO YOUR VOICE YOUR MANNER OF LIVING HAS A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH IT
8468-295198-0028 I ALWAYS DID TELL YOU THAT YOUR PASSION FOR WATER INJURED YOUR SINGING SUPPOSE TOMMY ORIOLE SHOULD SIT HALF HIS DAYS UP TO HIS HIPS IN WATER AS YOU DO HIS VOICE WOULD BE AS HOARSE AND ROUGH AS YOURS COME UP ON THE BANK AND LEARN TO PERCH AS WE BIRDS DO
8468-295198-0029 WE ARE THE TRUE MUSICAL RACE AND SO POOR MISTER BULLFROG WAS PERSUADED TO FOREGO HIS PLEASANT LITTLE COTTAGE UNDER THE CAT TAILS WHERE HIS GREEN SPECTACLES AND HONEST ROUND BACK HAD EXCITED EVEN IN THE MINDS OF THE BOYS SENTIMENTS OF RESPECT AND COMPASSION
8468-295198-0030 HE CAME UP INTO THE GARDEN AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF UNDER A BURDOCK AND BEGAN TO PRACTISE ITALIAN SCALES THE RESULT WAS THAT POOR OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG INSTEAD OF BEING CONSIDERED AS A RESPECTABLE OLD BORE
8468-295198-0031 GOT HIMSELF UNIVERSALLY LAUGHED AT FOR APING FASHIONABLE MANNERS EVERY BIRD AND BEAST IN THE FOREST HAD A GIBE AT HIM AND EVEN OLD PARSON TOO WHIT THOUGHT IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO MAKE HIM A PASTORAL CALL
8468-295198-0032 AND ADMONISH HIM ABOUT COURSES UNBEFITTING HIS AGE AND STANDING AS TO MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MAY BE SURE THAT SHE ASSURED EVERY ONE HOW SORRY SHE WAS THAT DEAR OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG HAD MADE SUCH A FOOL OF HIMSELF
8468-295198-0033 BUT THE TRAGEDY FOR THE POOR OLD MUSIC TEACHER GREW EVEN MORE MELANCHOLY IN ITS TERMINATION FOR ONE DAY AS HE WAS SITTING DISCONSOLATELY UNDER A CURRANT BUSH IN THE GARDEN PRACTISING HIS POOR OLD NOTES IN A QUIET WAY THUMP
8468-294887-0000 AND WITH A FEW OTHERS DEVOTED THE MOST OF THE SABBATH TO THEIR TEACHING WHEN HE AND HIS BROTHER ARTHUR ASSEMBLED THE SEVENTY ANTI SLAVERY AGENTS WHO WERE THEREAFTER LIKE FIREBRANDS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE LAND THEY HELD THEIR MEETINGS IN THIS ROOM
8468-294887-0001 THESE AGENTS WERE ENTERTAINED BY ABOLITIONISTS IN THE CITY AND MANY OF US HAD TWO OR THREE OF THEM IN EACH OF OUR FAMILIES FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
8468-294887-0002 THEY WENT OUT ALL OVER THE LAND AND WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN DIFFUSING MORE TRUTH PERHAPS ABOUT THE DREADFUL SYSTEM OF AMERICAN SLAVERY THAN WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN ANY OTHER WAY HE ALSO AIDED IN ESTABLISHING SEVERAL PERIODICALS BRIMFUL OF ANTI SLAVERY TRUTH
8468-294887-0003 AMONG WHICH WERE THE ANTI SLAVERY RECORD THE EMANCIPATOR THE SLAVE'S FRIEND THE LATTER TO INDOCTRINATE THE CHILDREN IN ANTI SLAVERY THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ORIGINALLY BEGUN FOR THE SUPPORT OF A MISSION IN AFRICA
8468-294887-0004 ON THE OCCASION OF THE RETURN OF THE AMISTAD CAPTORS TO THEIR NATIVE LAND AND NOW DOING SO MUCH FOR THE FREEDMEN OF THE SOUTH WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY ESTABLISHED BY HIS EFFORTS DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF SLAVERY MUCH WAS DONE BY THIS SOCIETY
8468-294887-0005 THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FOR AIDING AND BEFRIENDING FUGITIVES OF WHICH I WAS TREASURER FOR MANY YEARS HAD NO BETTER OR WARMER FRIEND THAN HE HE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AT THEIR MEETINGS WHICH WERE KNOWN ONLY TO THE ELECT FOR WE DARED NOT HOLD THEM TOO PUBLICLY
8468-294887-0006 AS WE ALMOST ALWAYS HAD SOME OF THE TRAVELERS TOWARD THE NORTH STAR PRESENT WHOSE MASTERS OR THEIR AGENTS WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE CITY IN HOT PURSUIT AT FIRST WE SENT THEM TO CANADA BUT AFTER A WHILE SENT THEM ONLY TO SYRACUSE AND THE CENTRE OF THE STATE
8468-294887-0007 IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR I THINK WAS THE FIRST RIOTING THE SACKING OF MISTER TAPPAN'S HOUSE IN ROSE STREET THE MOB BROUGHT ALL HIS FURNITURE OUT AND PILING IT UP IN THE STREET SET IT ON FIRE THE FAMILY WERE ABSENT AT THE TIME
8468-294887-0008 BUT HEARING THAT THERE WERE A FEW LOADED MUSKETS THERE THEY TOOK IT OUT IN THREATS BUT THEIR MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT WAS ALMOST OSTRACISED AT THIS TIME BY THE DRY GOODS MERCHANTS
8468-294887-0009 AND WHEN THEY DID SO REQUESTED PARTICULARLY THAT THE BUNDLES OR BOXES SHOULD NOT BE MARKED FROM A TAPPAN AND CO AS WAS CUSTOMARY SOUTHERN MERCHANTS ESPECIALLY AVOIDED THEM
8468-294887-0010 AND WHEN TWO OR THREE YEARS LATER THERE WAS A GENERAL INSOLVENCY AMONG THEM OCCASIONALLY LARGE LOSSES TO NEW YORK MERCHANTS AND IN SOME CASES FAILURE THE TAPPANS WERE SAVED BY HAVING NO SOUTHERN DEBTS
8468-294887-0011 MANY REMITTANCES CAME FOR THE HELP OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND AT ONE TIME AN EXTENSIVE INVOICE OF USEFUL AND FANCY ARTICLES IN SEVERAL LARGE BOXES WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GLASGOW LADIES SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH A LARGE BAZAAR OR FAIR
8468-294887-0012 WHICH WAS HELD IN BROOKLYN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH LATELY AFFLICTED BY DISEASE MISTER TAPPAN STILL LIVES IN THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HIS FACULTIES AND A GOOD MEASURE OF HEALTH
8468-294887-0013 AND IN HIS ADVANCED YEARS SEES NOW SOME OF THE GREAT RESULTS OF HIS LIFE LONG EFFORTS FOR THE RESTORATION AND MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ALTHOUGH STILL SUFFERING UNDER MANY OF THE EVILS WHICH SLAVERY HAS INFLICTED UPON HIM THE AMERICAN SLAVE NO LONGER EXISTS
8468-294887-0014 INSTEAD STANDS UP IN ALL OUR SOUTHERN STATES THE FREEDMAN KNOWING HIS RIGHTS AND AS A RULE ENJOYING THEM ORIGINAL AMERICAN ABOLITIONISTS WHO MET THE SCORN AND ODIUM THE IMPUTED SHAME AND OBLOQUY
8468-294887-0015 YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME ANTHONY LANE NEW YORK NOVEMBER EIGHTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE MISTER LANE MISTER TAPPAN'S PERSONAL FRIEND WHO LABORED WITH HIM IN THE ANTI SLAVERY CAUSE
8468-294887-0016 AND ESPECIALLY IN THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FOR MANY YEARS FROM SERIOUS AFFECTION OF HIS EYES
8468-294887-0017 MISTER TAPPAN WAS THEREFORE REQUESTED TO FURNISH A FEW REMINISCENCES FROM HIS OWN STORE HOUSE WHICH HE KINDLY DID AS FOLLOWS
8468-294887-0018 MY DEAR SIR IN ANSWER TO YOUR REQUEST THAT I WOULD FURNISH AN ARTICLE FOR YOUR FORTHCOMING BOOK GIVING INCIDENTS WITHIN MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE RELATING TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD I HAVE ALREADY APPRIZED YOU OF MY ILLNESS AND MY CONSEQUENT INABILITY
8468-294887-0019 TO WRITE SUCH AN ARTICLE AS WOULD BE WORTHY OF YOUR PUBLICATION HOWEVER FEELING SOMEWHAT RELIEVED TO DAY FROM MY PARALYSIS OWING TO THE CHEERING SUNSHINE AND THE FAVOR OF MY ALMIGHTY PRESERVER I WILL TRY TO DO WHAT I CAN IN DICTATING A FEW ANECDOTES TO MY AMANUENSIS
8468-294887-0020 WHICH MAY AFFORD YOU AND YOUR READERS SOME GRATIFICATION THESE FACTS I MUST GIVE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO DATE AS I WILL NOT TAX MY MEMORY WITH PERHAPS A VAIN ATTEMPT TO NARRATE THEM IN ORDER AS MENTIONED IN MY LIFE OF ARTHUR TAPPAN
8468-294887-0021 BUT REFLECTION CONVINCED THEM THAT IT WAS NOT ONLY RIGHT TO ASSIST MEN IN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THEIR LIBERTY WHEN UNJUSTLY HELD IN BONDAGE BUT A DUTY ABOLITIONISTS WHITE AND COLORED BOTH IN SLAVE AND FREE STATES
8468-294887-0022 THOSE WHO HAD MONEY CONTRIBUTED IT FREELY AND THOSE WHO WERE DESTITUTE OF MONEY GAVE THEIR TIME SAYING WITH THE APOSTLE SILVER AND GOLD HAVE I NONE BUT SUCH AS I HAVE GIVE I THEE ONE
8468-294887-0023 I RECOLLECT THAT ONE MORNING ON REACHING MY OFFICE THAT OF THE TREASURER OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION MY ASSISTANT TOLD ME THAT IN THE INNER ROOM WERE EIGHTEEN FUGITIVES MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAD ARRIVED THAT MORNING FROM THE SOUTH IN ONE COMPANY
8468-294887-0024 WHOM THEY HAD HIRED TO CONDUCT THEM WITHOUT THE LIMITS OF THE CITY IN THE EVENING WHEN THE POLICE FORCE WAS CHANGED THEY CAME THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY TO MY OFFICE
8468-294887-0025 AND BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO CANADA TWO
8468-294887-0026 A MISSUS MERCY SMITH BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER CLASS
8468-294887-0027 IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRIES THIS GIRL TOLD ME THE NAME OF THE SOUTHERN CITY AND THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD HELD HER AS A SLAVE AND THE MODE OF HER ESCAPE ET CETERA I WAS WALKING NEAR THE WATER SHE SAID WHEN A WHITE SAILOR SPOKE TO ME
8468-294887-0028 IF I WOULD COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING I DID SO AND WAS HID AND FED BY HIM AND ON LANDING AT NEW YORK HE CONDUCTED ME TO MISSUS SMITH'S HOUSE WHERE I AM NOW STAYING
8468-294887-0029 MOST OF THE TEACHERS WERE WARM HEARTED ABOLITIONISTS AND THE WHOLE NUMBER TAUGHT IN THIS SCHOOL DURING THIS PERIOD WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED
8468-294887-0030 TO MY INQUIRY HAVE YOU PARENTS LIVING AND ALSO BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE REPLIED THERE IS NO CHILD BUT MYSELF WERE NOT YOUR PARENTS KIND TO YOU AND DID YOU NOT LOVE THEM YES I LOVE THEM VERY MUCH
8468-294887-0031 HOW WERE YOU TREATED BY YOUR MASTER AND MISTRESS THEY TREATED ME VERY WELL HOW THEN SAID I COULD YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE CARE OF THAT SAILOR WHO WAS A STRANGER TO YOU AND LEAVE YOUR PARENTS I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER HEART FELT REPLY
8468-294887-0032 HE TOLD ME I SHOULD BE FREE ONE SUNDAY MORNING I RECEIVED A LETTER INFORMING ME THAT AN OFFICER BELONGING TO SAVANNAH GA HAD STARTED FOR NEW YORK IN PURSUIT OF TWO YOUNG MEN OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY
8468-294887-0033 AND WHO HAD ESCAPED AND WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN NEW YORK THE LETTER REQUESTED ME TO FIND THEM AND GIVE THEM WARNING AS THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST I CONCLUDED TO GO OVER TO NEW YORK NOTWITHSTANDING THE DOUBTFULNESS OF ATTEMPTING TO FIND THEM IN SO LARGE A CITY
8468-294887-0034 I WROTE NOTICES TO BE READ IN THE COLORED CHURCHES AND COLORED SABBATH SCHOOLS WHICH I DELIVERED IN PERSON I THEN WENT TO THE COLORED SCHOOL SUPERINTENDED
8468-294887-0035 I STATED MY ERRAND TO HIM WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE YOUNG MEN WHY SAID HE I MUST HAVE ONE OF THEM IN MY SCHOOL HE TOOK ME TO A CLASS WHERE I FOUND ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN TO WHOM I GAVE THE NEEDFUL INFORMATION
8468-294887-0036 OF SAVANNAH AND THAT HE HAD FIVE CHILDREN BY THE YOUNG MAN'S MOTHER WHO WAS HIS SLAVE ON HIS MARRIAGE TO A WHITE WOMAN HE SENT HIS FIVE COLORED CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHER TO AUCTION TO BE SOLD FOR CASH TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER
8468-294887-0037 ON BEING PUT UPON THE AUCTION BLOCK THIS YOUNG MAN ADDRESSED THE BYSTANDERS AND TOLD THEM THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE THAT HIS MOTHER HAD LONG LIVED IN THE FAMILY OF THE DOCTOR THAT IT WAS CRUEL TO SELL HER AND HER CHILDREN
8468-294887-0038 AND HE WARNED THE PEOPLE NOT TO BID FOR HIM FOR HE WOULD NO LONGER BE A SLAVE TO ANY MAN AND IF ANY ONE BOUGHT HIM HE WOULD LOSE HIS MONEY HE ADDED I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO SAY THIS I THEN SPOKE TO THE CROWD
8468-294887-0039 MY FATHER SAID I HAS LONG BEEN ONE OF YOUR FIRST DOCTORS AND DO YOU THINK IT RIGHT FOR HIM TO SELL MY MOTHER AND HIS CHILDREN IN THIS WAY I WAS SOLD AND MY BROTHER ALSO AND THE REST ALTHOUGH MY BROTHER SAID TO THE CROWD WHAT I HAD SAID WE SOON MADE OUR ESCAPE
8468-294887-0040 AND ARE NOW BOTH IN THE CITY I AM A BLACKSMITH AND HAVE WORKED SIX MONTHS IN ONE SHOP IN NEW YORK WITH WHITE JOURNEYMEN NOT ONE OF WHOM BELIEVES I SUPPOSE THAT I AM A COLORED MAN IT WAS NOT SURPRISING FOR SO FAIR WAS HIS COMPLEXION
8468-294887-0041 THAT WITH THE AID OF A BROWN WIG AFTER HE HAD CUT OFF HIS HAIR HE WAS COMPLETELY DISGUISED HE SOON NOTIFIED HIS BROTHER WHO LIVED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY AND BOTH PUT THEMSELVES OUT OF HARM'S WAY
8468-294887-0042 THEY WERE REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MEN AND IT SEEMED A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE THAT I SHOULD FIND THEM IN SUCH A LARGE CITY AND DIRECT THEM TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR PURSUER WITHIN ONE HOUR AFTER I LEFT MY HOUSE IN BROOKLYN
311-124404-0000 I WOULD HERE WILLINGLY HAVE PROCEEDED TO EXHIBIT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF TRUTHS WHICH I DEDUCED FROM THESE PRIMARY BUT AS WITH A VIEW TO THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY NOW TO TREAT OF MANY QUESTIONS
311-124404-0001 I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
311-124404-0002 I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
311-124404-0003 AND TO ACCEPT AS TRUE NOTHING THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME MORE CLEAR AND CERTAIN THAN THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE GEOMETERS HAD FORMERLY APPEARED AND YET I VENTURE TO STATE THAT NOT ONLY HAVE I FOUND MEANS
311-124404-0004 TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
311-124404-0005 AND OF WHICH HE HAS IMPRESSED ON OUR MINDS SUCH NOTIONS THAT AFTER WE HAVE REFLECTED SUFFICIENTLY UPON THESE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY OBSERVED IN ALL THAT EXISTS OR TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD AND FARTHER BY CONSIDERING
311-124404-0006 BUT LIKE THE PAINTERS WHO FINDING THEMSELVES UNABLE TO REPRESENT EQUALLY WELL ON A PLAIN SURFACE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACES OF A SOLID BODY SELECT ONE OF THE CHIEF ON WHICH ALONE THEY MAKE THE LIGHT FALL AND THROWING THE REST INTO THE SHADE
311-124404-0007 FEARING LEST I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPENSE IN MY DISCOURSE ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND I RESOLVED TO EXPOUND SINGLY THOUGH AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH MY OPINIONS REGARDING LIGHT THEN
311-124404-0008 TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
311-124404-0009 ON ALL THE BODIES THAT ARE UPON THE EARTH SINCE THEY ARE EITHER COLORED OR TRANSPARENT OR LUMINOUS AND FINALLY ON MAN SINCE HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF THESE OBJECTS
311-124404-0010 FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
311-124404-0011 I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
311-124404-0012 MATTER SUFFICIENT TO COMPOSE ONE AND WERE TO AGITATE VARIOUSLY AND CONFUSEDLY THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS MATTER SO THAT THERE RESULTED A CHAOS AS DISORDERED AS THE POETS EVER FEIGNED
311-124404-0013 AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
311-124404-0014 AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
311-124404-0015 FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
311-124404-0016 I ENDEAVORED TO DEMONSTRATE ALL THOSE ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
311-124404-0017 THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
311-124404-0018 AS TO PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF HEAVENS HOW IN THE MEANTIME SOME OF ITS PARTS MUST COMPOSE AN EARTH AND SOME PLANETS AND COMETS AND OTHERS A SUN AND FIXED STARS AND MAKING A DIGRESSION AT THIS STAGE ON THE SUBJECT OF LIGHT
311-124404-0019 I EXPOUNDED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT LIGHT MUST BE
311-124404-0020 AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
311-124404-0021 AND ALL THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THESE HEAVENS AND STARS SO THAT I THOUGHT I HAD SAID ENOUGH RESPECTING THEM TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVABLE IN THE HEAVENS OR STARS OF OUR SYSTEM THAT MUST NOT OR AT LEAST MAY NOT APPEAR PRECISELY ALIKE IN THOSE OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0022 I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
311-124404-0023 TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
311-124404-0024 AND THE METALS PRODUCED IN THE MINES AND THE PLANTS GROW IN THE FIELDS AND IN GENERAL HOW ALL THE BODIES WHICH ARE COMMONLY DENOMINATED MIXED OR COMPOSITE MIGHT BE GENERATED AND AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THE DISCOVERIES ALLUDED TO
311-124404-0025 I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
311-124404-0026 TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
311-124404-0027 AND FINALLY HOW FROM THESE ASHES
311-124404-0028 FOR AS THIS TRANSMUTATION OF ASHES INTO GLASS APPEARED TO ME AS WONDERFUL AS ANY OTHER IN NATURE I TOOK A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN DESCRIBING IT I WAS NOT HOWEVER DISPOSED FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
311-124404-0029 TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED IN THE MANNER I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0030 BUT THIS IS CERTAIN AND AN OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVED AMONG THEOLOGIANS THAT THE ACTION BY WHICH HE NOW SUSTAINS IT IS THE SAME WITH THAT BY WHICH HE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT
311-124404-0031 SO THAT EVEN ALTHOUGH HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING GIVEN IT NO OTHER FORM THAN THAT OF CHAOS PROVIDED ONLY HE HAD ESTABLISHED CERTAIN LAWS OF NATURE AND HAD LENT IT HIS CONCURRENCE TO ENABLE IT TO ACT AS IT IS WONT TO DO
311-124404-0032 IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
311-124404-0033 FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF INANIMATE BODIES AND PLANTS I PASSED TO ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY TO MAN
311-124404-0034 BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
311-124404-0035 NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
311-124404-0036 OF THE SAME MATTER WITH THAT I HAD DESCRIBED AND AT FIRST PLACED IN IT NO RATIONAL SOUL NOR ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE IN ROOM OF THE VEGETATIVE OR SENSITIVE SOUL BEYOND KINDLING IN THE HEART ONE OF THOSE FIRES WITHOUT LIGHT
311-124404-0037 AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
311-124404-0038 AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
311-124404-0039 CONSISTS IN THINKING FUNCTIONS IN WHICH THE ANIMALS VOID OF REASON MAY BE SAID WHOLLY TO RESEMBLE US BUT AMONG WHICH I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY OF THOSE THAT AS DEPENDENT ON THOUGHT ALONE BELONG TO US AS MEN
311-124404-0040 WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND I DID AFTERWARDS DISCOVER THESE AS SOON AS I SUPPOSED GOD TO HAVE CREATED A RATIONAL SOUL AND TO HAVE ANNEXED IT TO THIS BODY IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0041 WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
311-124404-0042 TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF GETTING DISSECTED IN THEIR PRESENCE THE HEART OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL POSSESSED OF LUNGS
311-124404-0043 AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
311-124404-0044 WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
311-124404-0045 PRESENTLY DISPERSE THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE LUNGS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE CAVITY IN THE LEFT SIDE
311-124404-0046 TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
311-124404-0047 WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
311-124404-0048 I SHOULD WISH ALSO THAT SUCH PERSONS WERE CAREFULLY SHOWN THE ELEVEN PELLICLES WHICH LIKE SO MANY SMALL VALVES OPEN AND SHUT THE FOUR ORIFICES THAT ARE IN THESE TWO CAVITIES VIZ
311-124404-0049 THREE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOLLOW VEINS WHERE THEY ARE DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS BY NO MEANS TO PREVENT THE BLOOD WHICH IT CONTAINS FROM FLOWING INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART AND YET EXACTLY TO PREVENT ITS FLOWING OUT THREE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARTERIAL VEIN
311-124404-0050 WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
311-124404-0051 TWO OTHERS AT THE MOUTH OF THE VENOUS ARTERY WHICH ALLOW THE BLOOD FROM THE LUNGS TO FLOW INTO THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART BUT PRECLUDE ITS RETURN AND THREE AT THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH SUFFER THE BLOOD TO FLOW FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0052 BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
311-124404-0053 WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
311-124404-0054 AND THERE FORM AS IT WERE TWO POUCHES DENOMINATED THE AURICLES OF THE HEART WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF A SUBSTANCE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HEART ITSELF AND THAT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE WARMTH IN THE HEART THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE BODY
311-124404-0055 AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
311-124404-0056 FOR AFTER THESE THINGS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN THE MOTION OF THE HEART EXCEPT THAT WHEN ITS CAVITIES ARE NOT FULL OF BLOOD
311-124404-0057 INTO THESE THE BLOOD OF NECESSITY FLOWS FROM THE HOLLOW VEIN INTO THE RIGHT AND FROM THE VENOUS ARTERY INTO THE LEFT BECAUSE THESE TWO VESSELS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF BLOOD AND THEIR ORIFICES WHICH ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE HEART CANNOT THEN BE CLOSED
311-124404-0058 BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
311-124404-0059 ARE IMMEDIATELY RAREFIED AND DILATED BY THE HEAT THEY MEET WITH IN THIS WAY THEY CAUSE THE WHOLE HEART TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESS HOME AND SHUT THE FIVE SMALL VALVES THAT ARE AT THE ENTRANCES
311-124404-0060 OF THE TWO VESSELS FROM WHICH THEY FLOW AND THUS PREVENT ANY MORE BLOOD FROM COMING DOWN INTO THE HEART AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE RAREFIED THEY PUSH OPEN THE SIX SMALL VALVES THAT ARE IN THE ORIFICES OF THE OTHER TWO VESSELS THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS OUT
311-124404-0061 CAUSING IN THIS WAY ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND OF THE GRAND ARTERY TO EXPAND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE HEART WHICH IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER BEGINS TO CONTRACT AS DO ALSO THE ARTERIES
311-124404-0062 AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
311-124404-0063 VENOUS ARTERY OPEN ANEW AND ALLOW A PASSAGE
311-124404-0064 WHICH CAUSE THE HEART AND THE ARTERIES AGAIN TO EXPAND AS BEFORE AND BECAUSE THE BLOOD WHICH THUS ENTERS INTO THE HEART PASSES
311-124404-0065 IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
311-124404-0066 TRUE REASONS FROM MERE VERISIMILITUDES SHOULD VENTURE WITHOUT EXAMINATION TO DENY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I WISH IT TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOTION WHICH I HAVE NOW EXPLAINED FOLLOWS AS NECESSARILY
311-124404-0067 FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
311-124404-0068 THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
311-124404-0069 AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
311-124404-0070 SO THAT ITS COURSE AMOUNTS PRECISELY TO A PERPETUAL CIRCULATION OF THIS WE HAVE ABUNDANT PROOF IN THE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SURGEONS WHO BY BINDING THE ARM WITH A TIE OF MODERATE STRAITNESS ABOVE THE PART WHERE THEY OPEN THE VEIN
311-124404-0071 CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
311-124404-0072 THE OPENING VERY TIGHT FOR IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE TIE MODERATELY STRAIGHTENED WHILE ADEQUATE TO HINDER THE BLOOD ALREADY IN THE ARM FROM RETURNING TOWARDS THE HEART BY THE VEINS CANNOT ON THAT ACCOUNT PREVENT NEW BLOOD
311-124404-0073 FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
311-124404-0074 TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
311-124404-0075 WHICH IS IN THE BODY MAY FLOW OUT OF IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THROUGH A SINGLE ARTERY THAT HAS BEEN CUT
311-124404-0076 SO AS TO PREVENT THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF IT COULD COME FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER THAN THE HEART BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EVINCE THAT WHAT I HAVE ALLEGED
311-124404-0077 IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
311-124404-0078 AND MORE VIVID AND WARMER IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE HEART IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IN THE ARTERIES THAN IT WAS A SHORT TIME BEFORE PASSING INTO EITHER IN OTHER WORDS WHEN IT WAS IN THE VEINS
311-124404-0079 AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
311-124404-0080 IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
311-124404-0081 SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE BLOOD IS IMPELLED AGAINST THEM WITH MORE FORCE THAN AGAINST THE VEINS AND WHY SHOULD THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART
311-124404-0082 AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
311-124404-0083 WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
311-124404-0084 AND THAT IN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT USE THEM WHILE IN THE WOMB
311-124404-0085 WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
311-124404-0086 AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
311-124404-0087 AND THERE OCCUPY THE PLACE OF SOME OTHERS EXPELLED BY THEM AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION SHAPE OR SMALLNESS OF THE PORES WITH WHICH THEY MEET SOME RATHER THAN OTHERS FLOW INTO CERTAIN PARTS
311-124404-0088 WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
311-124404-0089 IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
311-124404-0090 ASCENDING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE FROM THE HEART TO THE BRAIN THENCE PENETRATES THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE MUSCLES AND GIVES MOTION TO ALL THE MEMBERS SO THAT TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE BLOOD WHICH AS MOST AGITATED AND PENETRATING
311-124404-0091 PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0092 IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
311-124404-0093 WHICH FLOW FORTH FROM THE LEFT CAVITY OF THE HEART AND TEND TOWARDS THE BRAIN THE WEAKER AND LESS AGITATED PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DRIVEN ASIDE FROM THAT POINT BY THE STRONGER WHICH ALONE IN THIS WAY REACH IT
311-124404-0094 I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
311-124404-0095 TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
311-124404-0096 WAKING SLEEP AND DREAMS HOW LIGHT SOUNDS ODORS TASTES HEAT AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IMPRESS IT WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS BY MEANS OF THE SENSES HOW HUNGER
311-124404-0097 THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
311-124404-0098 BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
311-124404-0099 TO THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY THE DIFFERENT AUTOMATA OR MOVING MACHINES FABRICATED BY HUMAN INDUSTRY AND THAT WITH HELP OF BUT FEW PIECES COMPARED WITH THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF BONES
311-124404-0100 MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
311-124404-0101 AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
311-124404-0102 WE COULD HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING THAT THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THESE ANIMALS BUT IF THERE WERE MACHINES BEARING THE IMAGE OF OUR BODIES AND CAPABLE OF IMITATING OUR ACTIONS AS FAR AS IT IS MORALLY POSSIBLE
311-124404-0103 OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
311-124404-0104 FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
311-124404-0105 APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
311-124404-0106 THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
311-124404-0107 THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
311-124404-0108 DESTITUTE OF THE ORGANS WHICH OTHERS USE IN SPEAKING ARE IN THE HABIT OF SPONTANEOUSLY INVENTING CERTAIN SIGNS BY WHICH THEY DISCOVER THEIR THOUGHTS TO THOSE WHO BEING USUALLY IN THEIR COMPANY HAVE LEISURE TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0109 AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
311-124404-0110 AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
311-124404-0111 SHOULD NOT IN THIS BE EQUAL TO THE MOST STUPID INFANT OF ITS KIND OR AT LEAST TO ONE THAT WAS CRACK BRAINED UNLESS THE SOUL OF BRUTES
311-124404-0112 AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0113 SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
311-124404-0114 THAT THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ANIMALS WHICH MANIFEST MORE INDUSTRY THAN WE IN CERTAIN OF THEIR ACTIONS THE SAME ANIMALS ARE YET OBSERVED TO SHOW NONE AT ALL IN MANY OTHERS SO THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THEY DO BETTER
311-124404-0115 AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
311-124404-0116 CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
311-124404-0117 AS THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH I HAD SPOKEN BUT THAT IT MUST BE EXPRESSLY CREATED AND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT IT BE LODGED IN THE HUMAN BODY EXACTLY LIKE A PILOT IN A SHIP UNLESS PERHAPS TO MOVE ITS MEMBERS
311-124404-0118 BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
311-124404-0119 THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
311-124404-0120 AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT AFTER THIS LIFE WE HAVE NOTHING TO HOPE FOR OR FEAR MORE THAN FLIES AND ANTS IN PLACE OF WHICH WHEN WE KNOW HOW FAR THEY DIFFER WE MUCH BETTER COMPREHEND THE REASONS WHICH ESTABLISH
311-124404-0121 BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
2518-154826-0000 THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS
2518-154826-0001 WITH THE STRAIGHT SUNPATH ACROSS IT SPANGLED AND GLEAMING LIKE A MACKEREL'S BACK THE RELIEF OF BEING ONCE MORE ON FIRM GROUND AND THE EXULTATION OF AN ESCAPE FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER REMOVED MY PAIN AND MADE ME FORGET THAT MY LEG WAS BROKEN
2518-154826-0002 AND THE WIND WHICH A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THREATENED TO BLOW ME FROM THAT NARROW LEDGE SEEMED NOW BUT THE GENTLEST OF BREEZES FRESH WITH THE BREATH OF THE KINDLY SEA BUT THIS WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ANGUISH CAME BACK AND GREW APACE
2518-154826-0003 AND I FELL TO THINKING DISMALLY OF THE PLIGHT WE WERE IN HOW THINGS HAD BEEN AGAINST US IN THESE LAST DAYS FIRST THERE WAS LOSING THE WHY NOT AND THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH SECOND
2518-154826-0004 THERE WAS THE BEING KNOWN BY THE EXCISE FOR SMUGGLERS AND PERHAPS FOR MURDERERS THIRD AND LAST THERE WAS THE BREAKING OF MY LEG WHICH MADE ESCAPE SO DIFFICULT BUT MOST OF ALL
2518-154826-0005 THERE CAME BEFORE MY EYES THAT GREY FACE TURNED UP AGAINST THE MORNING SUN AND I THOUGHT OF ALL IT MEANT FOR GRACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN LIFE TO CALL BACK THAT OF OUR WORST ENEMY THEN ELZEVIR SAT UP STRETCHING HIMSELF LIKE ONE WAKING OUT OF SLEEP
2518-154826-0006 AND SAID WE MUST BE GONE THEY WILL NOT BE BACK FOR SOME TIME YET AND WHEN THEY COME WILL NOT THINK TO SEARCH CLOSELY FOR US HEREABOUTS BUT THAT WE CANNOT RISK AND MUST GET CLEAR AWAY
2518-154826-0007 THIS LEG OF THINE WILL KEEP US TIED FOR WEEKS AND WE MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIE HID AND TEND IT NOW I KNOW SUCH A HIDING HOLE IN PURBECK WHICH THEY CALL JOSEPH'S PIT AND THITHER WE MUST GO BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DAY TO GET THERE
2518-154826-0008 AND SO HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AGAIN AND STARTED OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS I NEED NOT TELL OF THAT WEARY JOURNEY AND INDEED COULD NOT IF I WISHED FOR THE PAIN WENT TO MY HEAD AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH A DROWSY ANGUISH
2518-154826-0009 THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER
2518-154826-0010 IT WAS AFTER NOON FOR THE SUN WAS PAST THE MERIDIAN AND VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF THE SHORT SWARD OF THE OPEN DOWN SPRINKLED WITH TINY WHITE SNAIL SHELLS
2518-154826-0011 THE GROUND WAS BRASHY WITH FLAT STONES AND DIVIDED UP INTO TILLAGE FIELDS IT WAS A BLEAK WIDE BITTEN PLACE ENOUGH LOOKING AS IF TWOULD NEVER PAY FOR TURNING AND INSTEAD OF HEDGES THERE WERE DREARY WALLS BUILT OF DRY STONE WITHOUT MORTAR
2518-154826-0012 BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES BUT HELD TOGETHER WITH STRAGGLING IVY AND BUTTRESSED HERE AND THERE WITH A BRAMBLE BUSH ELZEVIR PUT ME DOWN AT LENGTH AND SAID I AM BEAT AND CAN CARRY THEE NO FARTHER FOR THIS PRESENT
2518-154826-0013 THOUGH THERE IS NOT NOW MUCH FARTHER TO GO WE HAVE PASSED PURBECK GATES AND THESE WALLS WILL SCREEN US FROM PRYING EYES IF ANY CHANCE COMER PASS ALONG THE DOWN AND AS FOR THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE NOT LIKE TO COME THIS WAY SO SOON
2518-154826-0014 AND IF THEY COME I CANNOT HELP IT FOR WEARINESS AND THE SUN'S HEAT HAVE MADE MY FEET LIKE LEAD A SCORE OF YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SUCH A TASK BUT NOW TIS DIFFERENT
2518-154826-0015 SO SIT THEE HERE AND LEAN THY SHOULDER UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THUS THOU CANST LOOK THROUGH THIS BROKEN PLACE AND WATCH BOTH WAYS THEN IF THOU SEE AUGHT MOVING WAKE ME UP
2518-154826-0016 I WISH I HAD A THIMBLEFUL OF POWDER TO MAKE THIS WHISTLE SOUND' AND HE TOOK MASKEW'S SILVER BUTTED PISTOL AGAIN FROM HIS BOSOM AND HANDLED IT LOVINGLY
2518-154826-0017 WITH THAT HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN WHERE THERE WAS A NARROW SHADOW CLOSE AGAINST THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL AND IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM HIS HEAVY BREATHING THAT HE WAS ASLEEP THE WIND HAD FRESHENED MUCH AND WAS BLOWING STRONG FROM THE WEST
2518-154826-0018 AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL
2518-154826-0019 AND GETS AT LENGTH INTO SHELTER MOREOVER THOUGH I WAS NOT TIRED BY GRIEVOUS TOIL LIKE ELZEVIR I HAD PASSED A NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP AND FELT BESIDES THE WEARINESS OF PAIN TO LULL ME TO SLUMBER
2518-154826-0020 THEN I SOUGHT SOMETHING TO FIX MY THOUGHTS AND LOOKING ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL WHERE THE SWARD WAS FELL TO COUNTING THE MOLE HILLS THAT WERE CAST UP IN NUMBERS THEREABOUT AND WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THEM AND RECKONED UP THIRTY LITTLE HEAPS OF DRY AND POWDERY BROWN EARTH
2518-154826-0021 THAT LAY AT RANDOM ON THE GREEN TURF I TURNED MY EYES TO THE TILLAGE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND SAW THE INCH HIGH BLADES OF CORN COMING UP BETWEEN THE STONES THEN I FELL TO COUNTING THE BLADES FEELING GLAD TO HAVE DISCOVERED A RECKONING THAT WOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED AT THIRTY
2518-154826-0022 BUT WOULD GO ON FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND BEFORE I HAD REACHED TEN IN SO HEROIC A NUMERATION WAS FAST ASLEEP A SHARP NOISE WOKE ME WITH A START THAT SET THE PAIN TINGLING IN MY LEG
2518-154826-0023 AND THOUGH I COULD SEE NOTHING I KNEW THAT A SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED VERY NEAR US I WAS FOR WAKING ELZEVIR BUT HE WAS ALREADY FULL AWAKE AND PUT A FINGER ON HIS LIP TO SHOW I SHOULD NOT SPEAK THEN
2518-154826-0024 ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH THE LEAVES WITHOUT BEING SEEN HE DROPPED DOWN AGAIN WITH A LOOK OF RELIEF AND SAID TIS BUT A LAD SCARING ROOKS WITH A BLUNDERBUSS WE WILL NOT STIR UNLESS HE MAKES THIS WAY A MINUTE LATER HE SAID THE BOY IS COMING STRAIGHT FOR THE WALL
2518-154826-0025 WE SHALL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES AND WHILE HE SPOKE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF FALLING STONES WHERE THE BOY WAS PARTLY CLIMBING AND PARTLY PULLING DOWN THE DRY WALL AND SO ELZEVIR STOOD UP THE BOY LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RUN OFF
2518-154826-0026 BUT ELZEVIR PASSED HIM THE TIME OF DAY IN A CIVIL VOICE AND HE STOPPED AND GAVE IT BACK WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SON BLOCK ASKED SCARING ROOKS FOR FARMER TOPP WAS THE ANSWER
2518-154826-0027 HAVE YOU GOT A CHARGE OF POWDER TO SPARE SAID ELZEVIR SHOWING HIS PISTOL I WANT TO GET A RABBIT IN THE GORSE FOR SUPPER AND HAVE DROPPED MY FLASK MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN A FLASK IN WALKING THROUGH THE FURROWS HE WHISPERED TO ME TO LIE STILL
2518-154826-0028 NO TIME WAS WASTED IN WORDS ELZEVIR HAD THE FLASK IN HIS POCKET AND THE BOY WAS BITING THE CROWN WHAT SHOT HAVE YOU SAID ELZEVIR WHAT HAVE YOU DROPPED YOUR SHOT FLASK TOO ASKED THE BOY
2518-154826-0029 AND HIS VOICE HAD SOMETHING OF SURPRISE IN IT NAY BUT MY SHOT ARE OVER SMALL
2518-154826-0030 BUT THOU MUST PAY A SHILLING FOR THEM MY MASTER SAYS I NEVER AM TO USE THEM EXCEPT I SEE A SWAN OR BUZZARD OR SOMETHING FIT TO COOK COME OVER I SHALL GET A SOUND BEATING FOR MY PAINS AND TO BE BEAT IS WORTH A SHILLING IF THOU ART BEAT BE BEAT FOR SOMETHING MORE SAYS ELZEVIR THE TEMPTER
2518-154826-0031 THE SMUGGLERS GOT OFF CLEAR BUT THEY SAY THE HUE AND CRY IS UP ALREADY AND THAT A HEAD PRICE WILL BE FIXED OF TWENTY POUND SO IF I SELL YOU A FOWLING PIECE MAYBE I SHALL DO WRONG AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT UPON ME AS WELL AS MY MASTER THE SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED TO SUSPICION
2518-154826-0032 FOR WHILE HE SPOKE I SAW THAT HIS EYE HAD FALLEN ON MY FOOT THOUGH I TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE SHADOW AND THAT HE SAW THE BOOT CLOTTED WITH BLOOD AND THE KERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY LEG TIS FOR THAT VERY REASON SAYS ELZEVIR THAT I WANT THE FIRELOCK
2518-154826-0033 THESE SMUGGLERS ARE ROAMING LOOSE AND A PISTOL IS A POOR THING TO STOP SUCH WICKED RASCALS ON A LONE HILL SIDE COME COME THOU DOST NOT WANT A PIECE TO GUARD THEE THEY WILL NOT HURT A BOY HE HAD THE GUINEA BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
2518-154826-0034 AND SO I SAID AS MUCH TO ELZEVIR WHO ONLY LAUGHED SAYING THE BOY WAS SIMPLE AND HARMLESS BUT FROM WHERE I SAT I COULD PEEP OUT THROUGH THE BRAMBLES IN THE OPEN GAP AND SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THERE WAS MY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WALKING CARELESSLY ENOUGH
2518-154826-0035 BUT WHEN ELZEVIR SAT DOWN THE BOY GAVE A CAREFUL LOOK ROUND AND SEEING NO ONE WATCHING ANY MORE
2518-154826-0036 THEN I KNEW THAT HE HAD GUESSED WHO WE WERE AND WAS OFF TO WARN THE HUE AND CRY BUT BEFORE ELZEVIR WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN THE BOY WAS OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE HILL BROW LET US MOVE ON SAID BLOCK TIS BUT A LITTLE DISTANCE NOW TO GO AND THE HEAT IS PAST ALREADY
2518-154826-0037 WE MUST HAVE SLEPT THREE HOURS OR MORE FOR THOU ART BUT A SORRY WATCHMAN JOHN TIS WHEN THE SENTRY SLEEPS THAT THE ENEMY LAUGHS AND FOR THEE THE POSSE MIGHT HAVE HAD US BOTH LIKE DAYLIGHT OWLS WITH THAT HE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND MADE OFF WITH A LUSTY STRIDE
2518-154826-0038 AND IN THE SHELTER OF THE WALLS WE HAD SLEPT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT FOR THE SUN WAS WESTERING FAST AND THOUGH THE REST HAD REFRESHED ME MY LEG HAD GROWN STIFF AND HURT THE MORE IN DANGLING WHEN WE STARTED AGAIN
2518-154826-0039 ELZEVIR WAS STILL WALKING STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY BURDEN HE CARRIED AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I KNEW THOUGH I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE WE WERE IN THE LAND OF THE OLD MARBLE QUARRIES AT THE BACK OF ANVIL POINT
2518-154826-0040 ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY
2518-154826-0041 AND I AM TOLD IN OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WELL AND THE WAY OF MAKING A MARBLE QUARRY IS TO SINK A TUNNEL SLANTING VERY STEEPLY DOWN INTO THE EARTH LIKE A WELL TURNED ASKEW TILL YOU REACH FIFTY SEVENTY OR PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP THEN
2518-154826-0042 FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES
2518-154826-0043 WHICH WAS JUST PUTTING ON THE BRIGHTER GREEN OF SPRING THIS TURF WAS NOT SMOOTH BUT HUMMOCKY FOR UNDER IT LAY HEAPS OF WORTHLESS STONE AND MARBLE DRAWN OUT OF THE QUARRIES AGES AGO WHICH THE GREEN VESTMENT HAD COVERED FOR THE MOST PART
2518-154826-0044 THOUGH IT LEFT SOMETIMES A LITTLE PATCH OF BROKEN RUBBLE PEERING OUT AT THE TOP OF A MOUND THERE WERE MANY TUMBLE DOWN WALLS AND LOW GABLES LEFT OF THE COTTAGES OF THE OLD QUARRYMEN GRASS COVERED RIDGES MARKED OUT THE LITTLE GARDEN FOLDS
2518-154826-0045 AND HERE AND THERE STILL STOOD A FORLORN GOOSEBERRY BUSH
2518-154826-0046 ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
2518-154826-0047 FOR IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS HOLY PURPOSE THE MANDRIVE WOULD HAVE POWER TO STRANGLE THE MAN THAT HEWED IT IT WAS BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE OLD SHAFTS THAT ELZEVIR LAID ME DOWN AT LAST THE LIGHT WAS VERY LOW
2518-154826-0048 AND THE SWARD CREPT OVER THE EDGES OF THE HOLE AND EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE IN STEPS AND SLIDE WAS GREEN WITH FERNS THE GREEN FERNS SHROUDED THE WALLS OF THE HOLE AND RUDDY BROWN BRAMBLES OVERGREW THE STEPS
2518-154826-0049 THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY
2518-154826-0050 AND BEFORE THEY COME TO WHERE WE LIE WE CAN HOLD THE TROOP AT BAY AND SELL OUR LIVES SO DEAR THEY WILL NOT CARE TO BUY THEM WE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STEPS BACK FIRST AS ONE GOES DOWN A HATCHWAY
2518-154826-0051 AND HOW FAR OFF WE WERE NOW AND HOW LONG IT WAS LIKELY TO BE BEFORE I SAW THAT DEAR VILLAGE AND GRACE AGAIN THE STAIRS WERE STILL SHARP CUT AND LITTLE WORN BUT ELZEVIR PAID GREAT CARE TO HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD SLIP ON THE FERNS AND MOSSES WITH WHICH THEY WERE OVERGROWN
2518-154826-0052 HE SHOVED THEM ASIDE WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND SCREENED MY DANGLING LEG FROM GETTING CAUGHT THUS HE CAME SAFE WITHOUT STUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT WHEN WE GOT THERE ALL WAS DARK BUT HE STEPPED OFF INTO A NARROW OPENING ON THE RIGHT HAND
2518-154826-0053 AND WALKED ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT PERCEIVED THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ENDLESS GALLERIES CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART TO ALLOW OF WALKING UPRIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SO LOW AS TO FORCE HIM TO BEND DOWN
2518-154826-0054 AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH
445-123860-0000 TIS BETTER TO BE VILE THAN VILE ESTEEM'D WHEN NOT TO BE RECEIVES REPROACH OF BEING AND THE JUST PLEASURE LOST WHICH IS SO DEEM'D NOT BY OUR FEELING BUT BY OTHERS SEEING
445-123860-0001 FOR WHY SHOULD OTHERS FALSE ADULTERATE EYES GIVE SALUTATION TO MY SPORTIVE BLOOD OR ON MY FRAILTIES WHY ARE FRAILER SPIES WHICH IN THEIR WILLS COUNT BAD WHAT I THINK GOOD
445-123860-0002 NO I AM THAT I AM AND THEY THAT LEVEL AT MY ABUSES RECKON UP THEIR OWN I MAY BE STRAIGHT THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES BE BEVEL
445-123860-0003 BY THEIR RANK THOUGHTS MY DEEDS MUST NOT BE SHOWN UNLESS THIS GENERAL EVIL THEY MAINTAIN ALL MEN ARE BAD AND IN THEIR BADNESS REIGN
445-123860-0004 WHICH SHALL ABOVE THAT IDLE RANK REMAIN BEYOND ALL DATE EVEN TO ETERNITY OR AT THE LEAST SO LONG AS BRAIN AND HEART HAVE FACULTY BY NATURE TO SUBSIST
445-123860-0005 THY RECORD NEVER CAN BE MISS'D THAT POOR RETENTION COULD NOT SO MUCH HOLD NOR NEED I TALLIES THY DEAR LOVE TO SCORE THEREFORE TO GIVE THEM FROM ME WAS I BOLD
445-123860-0006 THEY ARE BUT DRESSINGS OF A FORMER SIGHT OUR DATES ARE BRIEF AND THEREFORE WE ADMIRE WHAT THOU DOST FOIST UPON US THAT IS OLD AND RATHER MAKE THEM BORN TO OUR DESIRE THAN THINK THAT WE BEFORE HAVE HEARD THEM TOLD
445-123860-0007 THY REGISTERS AND THEE I BOTH DEFY NOT WONDERING AT THE PRESENT NOR THE PAST FOR THY RECORDS AND WHAT WE SEE DOTH LIE
445-123860-0008 IT SUFFERS NOT IN SMILING POMP NOR FALLS UNDER THE BLOW OF THRALLED DISCONTENT
445-123860-0009 IT FEARS NOT POLICY THAT HERETIC WHICH WORKS ON LEASES OF SHORT NUMBER'D HOURS BUT ALL ALONE STANDS HUGELY POLITIC THAT IT NOR GROWS WITH HEAT NOR DROWNS WITH SHOWERS TO THIS I WITNESS CALL
445-123860-0010 THE FOOLS OF TIME WHICH DIE FOR GOODNESS WHO HAVE LIVED FOR CRIME
445-123860-0011 WERE'T AUGHT TO ME I BORE THE CANOPY WITH MY EXTERN THE OUTWARD HONOURING OR LAID GREAT BASES FOR ETERNITY WHICH PROVES MORE SHORT THAN WASTE OR RUINING
445-123860-0012 HAVE I NOT SEEN DWELLERS ON FORM AND FAVOUR LOSE ALL AND MORE BY PAYING TOO MUCH RENT FOR COMPOUND SWEET FORGOING SIMPLE SAVOUR PITIFUL THRIVERS IN THEIR GAZING SPENT NO
445-123860-0013 LET ME BE OBSEQUIOUS IN THY HEART AND TAKE THOU MY OBLATION POOR BUT FREE WHICH IS NOT MIX'D WITH SECONDS KNOWS NO ART BUT MUTUAL RENDER ONLY ME FOR THEE HENCE THOU SUBORNED INFORMER

445-123860-0015 O THOU MY LOVELY BOY WHO IN THY POWER DOST HOLD TIME'S FICKLE GLASS HIS FICKLE HOUR WHO HAST BY WANING GROWN
445-123860-0016 IF NATURE SOVEREIGN MISTRESS OVER WRACK AS THOU GOEST ONWARDS STILL WILL PLUCK THEE BACK SHE KEEPS THEE TO THIS PURPOSE
445-123860-0017 BUT NOW IS BLACK BEAUTY'S SUCCESSIVE HEIR AND BEAUTY SLANDER'D WITH A BASTARD SHAME FOR SINCE EACH HAND HATH PUT ON NATURE'S POWER FAIRING THE FOUL WITH ART'S FALSE BORROWED FACE
445-123860-0018 SWEET BEAUTY HATH NO NAME NO HOLY BOWER BUT IS PROFAN'D IF NOT LIVES IN DISGRACE
445-123860-0019 AND THEY MOURNERS SEEM AT SUCH WHO NOT BORN FAIR NO BEAUTY LACK SLAND'RING CREATION WITH A FALSE ESTEEM YET SO THEY MOURN
445-123860-0020 WHILST MY POOR LIPS WHICH SHOULD THAT HARVEST REAP AT THE WOOD'S BOLDNESS BY THEE BLUSHING STAND TO BE SO TICKLED THEY WOULD CHANGE THEIR STATE AND SITUATION WITH THOSE DANCING CHIPS O'ER WHOM THY FINGERS WALK WITH GENTLE GAIT
445-123860-0021 MURDEROUS BLOODY FULL OF BLAME SAVAGE EXTREME RUDE CRUEL NOT TO TRUST ENJOY'D NO SOONER BUT DESPISED STRAIGHT PAST REASON HUNTED
445-123860-0022 AND NO SOONER HAD PAST REASON HATED AS A SWALLOW'D BAIT ON PURPOSE LAID TO MAKE THE TAKER MAD MAD IN PURSUIT AND IN POSSESSION SO HAD HAVING AND IN QUEST TO HAVE
445-123860-0023 EXTREME A BLISS IN PROOF
445-123860-0024 IF SNOW BE WHITE WHY THEN HER BREASTS ARE DUN IF HAIRS BE WIRES BLACK WIRES GROW ON HER HEAD I HAVE SEEN ROSES DAMASK'D RED AND WHITE
445-123860-0025 BUT NO SUCH ROSES SEE I IN HER CHEEKS AND IN SOME PERFUMES IS THERE MORE DELIGHT THAN IN THE BREATH THAT FROM MY MISTRESS REEKS I LOVE TO HEAR HER SPEAK
445-123860-0026 YET WELL I KNOW THAT MUSIC HATH A FAR MORE PLEASING SOUND I GRANT I NEVER SAW A GODDESS GO MY MISTRESS WHEN SHE WALKS TREADS ON THE GROUND
460-172359-0000 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
460-172359-0001 THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
460-172359-0002 AS GRAVE AS AN OPERATING SURGEON THEN AS I THINK I SAID MISTER SMITH CAME IN EVERY MORNING AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF FLORIDA WATER AND RUMS ESSENCES AND REVIVERS AND RENOVATORS REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE
460-172359-0003 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0004 TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0005 EVERYBODY KNEW JEFF AND LIKED HIM BUT THE ODD THING WAS THAT TILL HE MADE MONEY NOBODY TOOK ANY STOCK IN HIS IDEAS AT ALL IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE MADE THE CLEAN UP THAT THEY CAME TO SEE WHAT A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS LEVEL HEADED I THINK WAS THE TERM INDEED
460-172359-0006 IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
460-172359-0007 I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
460-172359-0008 WITH A FALSE FRONT THAT STICKS UP ABOVE ITS REAL HEIGHT AND GIVES IT AN AIR AT ONCE RECTANGULAR AND IMPOSING IT IS A FORM OF ARCHITECTURE MUCH USED IN MARIPOSA AND UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN KEEPING WITH THE PRETENTIOUS AND ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF MODERN BUSINESS
460-172359-0009 AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0010 THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
460-172359-0011 AS YOU OPEN THE DOOR IT SETS IN VIOLENT AGITATION A COILED SPRING UP ABOVE AND A BELL THAT ALMOST RINGS INSIDE THERE ARE TWO SHAVING CHAIRS OF THE HEAVIER OR ELECTROCUTION PATTERN
460-172359-0012 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0013 ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
460-172359-0014 THEY SAID COMMONLY IN MARIPOSA THAT JEFF MADE MONEY OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP HE MAY HAVE AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT THAT TURNED HIS MIND TO INVESTMENT BUT IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD A SHAVE COST FIVE CENTS AND A HAIR CUT FIFTEEN OR THE TWO IF YOU LIKED FOR A QUARTER
460-172359-0015 AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
460-172359-0016 AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
460-172359-0017 THE RAZOR WOULD GO SLOWER AND SLOWER AND PAUSE AND STOP MOVE AND PAUSE AGAIN TILL THE SHAVE DIED AWAY INTO THE MERE DROWSE OF CONVERSATION AT SUCH HOURS THE MARIPOSA BARBER SHOP WOULD BECOME A VERY PALACE OF SLUMBER
460-172359-0018 AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
460-172359-0019 YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
460-172359-0020 WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
460-172359-0022 AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
460-172359-0023 THERE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN THAT JEFF WOULD SIZE UP SIDEWAYS AS HE STROPPED THE RAZOR AND IN WHOSE EAR HE WOULD WHISPER I SEE WHERE SAINT LOUIS HAS TOOK FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES OFF CHICAGO AND SO HOLD HIM FASCINATED TO THE END IN THE SAME WAY HE WOULD SAY TO MISTER SMITH
460-172359-0024 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0025 THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
460-172359-0026 EXACTLY THE KIND OF A HEAD A MAN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE A HAUL OR A CLEAN UP IT WAS EVIDENTLY SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE HEAD AND AS FAR AS ONE COULD JUDGE JEFF'S OWN WAS THE VERY TYPE REQUIRED I DON'T KNOW JUST AT WHAT TIME OR HOW JEFFERSON FIRST BEGAN HIS SPECULATIVE ENTERPRISES
460-172359-0027 IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
460-172359-0028 I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
460-172359-0029 THAT THE WOMAN HAD SOLD AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN EGGS IN A DAY TO THE SUMMER VISITORS BUT WHAT WITH READING ABOUT AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS AND CONSOLIDATED COPPER AND ALL THAT THE HENS BEGAN TO SEEM PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND IN ANY CASE THE IDEA OF TWO DOZEN EGGS AT A CENT APIECE ALMOST MAKES ONE BLUSH
460-172359-0030 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
460-172359-0031 AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
460-172359-0032 AND RIGHT AT OUR VERY DOORS YOU COULD SEE AS I SAW THE NIGHT EXPRESS GOING NORTH EVERY EVENING FOR ALL ONE KNEW ROCKEFELLER OR CARNEGIE OR ANYONE MIGHT BE ON IT
460-172359-0033 SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
460-172359-0034 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
460-172359-0035 CAME BACK FROM THE COBALT COUNTRY WITH A FORTUNE AND LOAFED ROUND IN THE MARIPOSA HOUSE IN ENGLISH KHAKI AND A HORIZONTAL HAT DRUNK ALL THE TIME
460-172359-0036 THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
460-172359-0037 JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
460-172359-0038 THEY ALL WENT IN OR ALL EXCEPT MISTER SMITH YOU SEE MISTER SMITH HAD COME DOWN FROM THERE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT ROCKS AND MINING AND CANOES AND THE NORTH COUNTRY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO EAT FLOUR BAKED DAMPERS UNDER THE LEE SIDE OF A CANOE PROPPED AMONG THE UNDERBRUSH
460-172359-0039 BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
460-172359-0040 AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
460-172359-0041 AND THEN UNLOADED THEM ON ONE OF THE SAUSAGE MEN AT NETLEY'S BUTCHER SHOP AT A CLEAR CENT PER CENT ADVANCE JEFF WOULD OPEN THE LITTLE DRAWER BELOW THE MIRROR IN THE BARBER SHOP AND SHOW YOU ALL KINDS AND SORTS OF COBALT COUNTRY MINING CERTIFICATES
460-172359-0042 BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
460-172359-0043 I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
460-172359-0044 BUT IF A FELLER KNOWS THE COUNTRY AND KEEPS HIS HEAD LEVEL HE CAN'T LOSE JEFFERSON HAD LOOKED AT SO MANY PROSPECTUSES AND SO MANY PICTURES OF MINES AND PINE TREES AND SMELTERS THAT I THINK HE'D FORGOTTEN THAT HE'D NEVER BEEN IN THE COUNTRY ANYWAY WHAT'S TWO HUNDRED MILES
460-172359-0045 TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
460-172359-0046 THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
460-172359-0047 THEN HE'D TAKE A LOOK AT THE PINK AND BLUE CERTIFICATES OF THE CORONA JEWEL AND SLAM THE DRAWER ON THEM IN DISGUST WORSE THAN THAT WAS THE SILENT PINE A CLEAR CASE OF STUPID INCOMPETENCE
460-172359-0048 UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
460-172359-0049 IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
460-172359-0050 I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
460-172359-0051 AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
460-172359-0052 A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
460-172359-0053 AND THEN AND THEN WELL THAT'S JUST THE QUEER THING ABOUT THE MINING BUSINESS WHY SUDDEN AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IT SEEMED THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRE TO THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET THAT THEY HAD STRUCK A VEIN OF SILVER IN THE NORTHERN STAR AS THICK AS A SIDEWALK
460-172359-0054 AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
460-172359-0055 EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
460-172359-0056 AND IN LESS THAN NO TIME THERE WASN'T STANDING ROOM IN THE BARBER SHOP AND OVER IN SMITH'S HOTEL THEY HAD THREE EXTRA BARKEEPERS WORKING ON THE LAGER BEER PUMPS
460-172359-0057 AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
460-172359-0058 A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
460-172359-0059 WITH ONE HAND ON HIS KNEE AND A DOG ONE OF THOSE REGULAR MINING DOGS AT HIS FEET AND A LOOK OF PIERCING INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FACE THAT WOULD EASILY ACCOUNT FOR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I SAY THAT THE RECOGNITION MEANT A LOT TO JEFF FOR ITS OWN SAKE
460-172359-0060 THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
460-172359-0061 ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
460-172359-0062 THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
460-172359-0063 HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
460-172359-0064 AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
460-172359-0065 SO OF COURSE AS SOON AS JEFF MADE THE FORTUNE MYRA HAD HER RESIGNATION IN NEXT MORNING
460-172359-0066 AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
460-172359-0067 JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
460-172359-0068 FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
460-172359-0069 AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
460-172359-0070 BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
460-172359-0071 THEY MADE NO RASH PROMISES JUST ADMITTED STRAIGHT OUT THAT THE ENTERPRISE MIGHT REALISE FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT
460-172359-0072 I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
460-172359-0073 A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
460-172359-0074 ALL MONEY THEY MIGHT SEND WOULD BE TREATED JUST AS JEFF'S WOULD BE TREATED ONE REASON PERHAPS WHY JEFF DIDN'T GIVE UP SHAVING WAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWED HIM TO TALK ABOUT CUBA
460-172359-0075 AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
460-172359-0076 AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
460-172359-0077 LOOK AT MORGAN AND ROCKEFELLER AND ALL THE MEN THAT MAKE A PILE THEY KNOW JUST AS MUCH AS JEFF DID ABOUT THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY MAKE IT IT STANDS TO REASON DID I SAY THAT JEFF SHAVED IN THE SAME OLD WAY NOT QUITE
460-172359-0078 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
460-172359-0079 IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
460-172359-0080 HE WOULD SAY AND ANOTHER DAY HE WOULD PAUSE IN THE COURSE OF SHAVING AND ALMOST WHISPER DID YOU EVER SEE THIS ROCKEFELLER IT WAS ONLY BY A SORT OF ACCIDENT THAT I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO JEFFERSON'S SPECULATION THAT NO ONE IN MARIPOSA EVER KNEW OR WILL EVER KNOW NOW
460-172359-0081 YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
460-172359-0082 THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
460-172359-0083 AND BESIDE IT JEFF WOULD SIT WITH HIS SPECTACLES ON AND THE PAPER SPREAD OUT READING ABOUT CARNEGIE AND ROCKEFELLER NEAR HIM BUT AWAY FROM THE TABLE WAS THE WOMAN DOING NEEDLEWORK AND MYRA WHEN SHE WASN'T WORKING IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS THERE TOO WITH HER ELBOWS ON THE TABLE READING MARIE CORELLI
460-172359-0084 JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
460-172359-0085 I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
460-172359-0086 THEY GIVE IT AWAY AND WHO DO THEY GIVE IT TO WHY TO THOSE AS DON'T WANT IT EVERY TIME THEY GIVE IT TO THESE PROFESSORS AND TO THIS RESEARCH AND THAT AND DO THE POOR GET ANY OF IT NOT A CENT AND NEVER WILL I TELL YOU BOYS CONTINUED JEFF
460-172359-0087 THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
460-172359-0088 SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
460-172359-0089 HE ASKED ME FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY HOW MANY BLIND PEOPLE IT WOULD TAKE TO FILL ONE OF THESE BLIND HOMES AND HOW A FELLER COULD GET AHOLD OF THEM
460-172359-0090 A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
460-172359-0091 BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
460-172359-0092 ELSE HOW WAS IT THAT HENRY MULLINS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT SELLING A DRAFT FOR FORTY THOUSAND ON NEW YORK AND WHY WAS IT THAT MISTER SMITH WOULDN'T PAY BILLY THE DESK CLERK HIS BACK WAGES WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT IT INTO CUBA OH YES SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE SEEN IT
460-172359-0093 AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
460-172359-0094 YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
460-172359-0095 THAT WAS JEFF'S MONEY PART OF IT MULLINS GOT THE TELEGRAM FROM A BROKER OR SOMEONE AND HE SHOWED IT TO JEFF JUST AS HE WAS GOING UP THE STREET WITH AN ESTATE AGENT TO LOOK AT A BIG EMPTY LOT ON THE HILL BEHIND THE TOWN THE VERY PLACE FOR THESE INCURABLES
460-172359-0096 AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
460-172359-0097 AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
460-172359-0098 JEFF HAS TO WORK PRETTY LATE BUT THAT'S NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL IF YOU'VE WORKED HARD ALL YOUR LIFETIME
460-172359-0099 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
87-121553-0000 AND IN ITS GYRE HAD NOT TURNED WHOLLY ROUND BEFORE ANOTHER IN A RING ENCLOSED IT AND MOTION JOINED TO MOTION SONG TO SONG SONG THAT AS GREATLY DOTH TRANSCEND OUR MUSES OUR SIRENS IN THOSE DULCET CLARIONS AS PRIMAL SPLENDOUR THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED
87-121553-0001 WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
87-121553-0002 AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
87-121553-0003 OUT OF THE HEART OF ONE OF THE NEW LIGHTS THERE CAME A VOICE THAT NEEDLE TO THE STAR MADE ME APPEAR IN TURNING THITHERWARD AND IT BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME FAIR DRAWS ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OTHER LEADER BY WHOM SO WELL IS SPOKEN HERE OF MINE
87-121553-0004 TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
87-121553-0005 WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
87-121553-0006 WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
87-121553-0007 IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
87-121553-0008 AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
87-121553-0009 THE WOMAN WHO FOR HIM HAD GIVEN ASSENT SAW IN A DREAM THE ADMIRABLE FRUIT THAT ISSUE WOULD FROM HIM AND FROM HIS HEIRS AND THAT HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS HE WAS A SPIRIT FROM THIS PLACE WENT FORTH TO NAME HIM WITH HIS POSSESSIVE WHOSE HE WHOLLY WAS
87-121553-0010 DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
87-121553-0011 SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
87-121553-0012 NOT FOR THE WORLD WHICH PEOPLE TOIL FOR NOW IN FOLLOWING OSTIENSE AND TADDEO BUT THROUGH HIS LONGING AFTER THE TRUE MANNA HE IN SHORT TIME BECAME SO GREAT A TEACHER THAT HE BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD WHICH FADETH SOON IF FAITHLESS BE THE DRESSER
87-121553-0013 NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
87-121553-0014 HE ASKED FOR BUT AGAINST THE ERRANT WORLD PERMISSION TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SEED OF WHICH THESE FOUR AND TWENTY PLANTS SURROUND THEE THEN WITH THE DOCTRINE AND THE WILL TOGETHER WITH OFFICE APOSTOLICAL HE MOVED LIKE TORRENT WHICH SOME LOFTY VEIN OUT PRESSES
87-121553-0015 AND IN AMONG THE SHOOTS HERETICAL HIS IMPETUS WITH GREATER FURY SMOTE WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE WAS THE GREATEST OF HIM WERE MADE THEREAFTER DIVERS RUNNELS WHEREBY THE GARDEN CATHOLIC IS WATERED SO THAT MORE LIVING ITS PLANTATIONS STAND
87-121553-0016 IN WHICH THE HOLY CHURCH ITSELF DEFENDED AND IN THE FIELD ITS CIVIC BATTLE WON TRULY FULL MANIFEST SHOULD BE TO THEE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE OTHER UNTO WHOM THOMAS SO COURTEOUS WAS BEFORE MY COMING
87-121553-0017 BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
87-121553-0018 I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
87-121553-0019 WHO ALWAYS IN GREAT OFFICES POSTPONED CONSIDERATIONS SINISTER HERE ARE ILLUMINATO AND AGOSTINO WHO OF THE FIRST BAREFOOTED BEGGARS WERE THAT WITH THE CORD THE FRIENDS OF GOD BECAME HUGH OF SAINT VICTOR IS AMONG THEM HERE
87-121553-0020 AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
87-121553-0021 HERE IS RABANUS AND BESIDE ME HERE SHINES THE CALABRIAN ABBOT JOACHIM HE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ENDOWED TO CELEBRATE SO GREAT A PALADIN HAVE MOVED ME THE IMPASSIONED COURTESY AND THE DISCREET DISCOURSES OF FRIAR THOMAS
87-121553-0022 LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
87-121553-0023 THAT IN THE POINT BEGINNETH OF THE AXIS ROUND ABOUT WHICH THE PRIMAL WHEEL REVOLVES TO HAVE FASHIONED OF THEMSELVES TWO SIGNS IN HEAVEN
87-121553-0024 THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
87-121553-0025 AND HE WILL HAVE SOME SHADOWING FORTH OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DOUBLE DANCE THAT CIRCLED ROUND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS BECAUSE IT IS AS MUCH BEYOND OUR WONT AS SWIFTER THAN THE MOTION OF THE CHIANA MOVETH THE HEAVEN THAT ALL THE REST OUTSPEEDS
87-121553-0026 THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
87-121553-0027 THAT IT WEIGHS DOWN THE BALANCE OF ALL SIN WHATE'ER OF LIGHT IT HAS TO HUMAN NATURE BEEN LAWFUL TO POSSESS WAS ALL INFUSED BY THE SAME POWER THAT BOTH OF THEM CREATED AND HENCE AT WHAT I SAID ABOVE DOST WONDER
87-121553-0028 WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
87-121553-0029 AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
87-121553-0030 ITSELF ETERNALLY REMAINING ONE THENCE IT DESCENDS TO THE LAST POTENCIES DOWNWARD FROM ACT TO ACT BECOMING SUCH THAT ONLY BRIEF CONTINGENCIES IT MAKES AND THESE CONTINGENCIES I HOLD TO BE THINGS GENERATED
87-121553-0031 WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
87-121553-0032 AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
87-121553-0033 IN THE LIKE MANNER WORKING AS THE ARTIST WHO HAS THE SKILL OF ART AND HAND THAT TREMBLES IF THEN THE FERVENT LOVE THE VISION CLEAR OF PRIMAL VIRTUE DO DISPOSE AND SEAL PERFECTION ABSOLUTE IS THERE ACQUIRED
87-121553-0034 NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
87-121553-0035 THINK WHO HE WAS AND WHAT OCCASION MOVED HIM TO MAKE REQUEST WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM ASK I'VE NOT SO SPOKEN THAT THOU CANST NOT SEE CLEARLY HE WAS A KING WHO ASKED FOR WISDOM THAT HE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY A KING TWAS NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER IN WHICH ARE THE MOTORS HERE ABOVE
87-121553-0036 OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
87-121553-0037 AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
87-121553-0038 BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
87-121553-0039 AND THEN THE FEELINGS BIND THE INTELLECT FAR MORE THAN USELESSLY HE LEAVES THE SHORE SINCE HE RETURNETH NOT THE SAME HE WENT WHO FISHES FOR THE TRUTH AND HAS NO SKILL
87-121553-0040 THUS DID SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THOSE FOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN EVEN AS SWORDS UNTO THE SCRIPTURES IN RENDERING DISTORTED THEIR STRAIGHT FACES NOR YET SHALL PEOPLE BE TOO CONFIDENT IN JUDGING EVEN AS HE IS WHO DOTH COUNT THE CORN IN FIELD OR EVER IT BE RIPE
87-121553-0041 FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
87-121553-0042 AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
87-121553-0043 THIS MAN HAS NEED AND DOES NOT TELL YOU SO NOR WITH THE VOICE NOR EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE ROOT OF ONE TRUTH MORE DECLARE UNTO HIM IF THE LIGHT WHEREWITH BLOSSOMS YOUR SUBSTANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU ETERNALLY THE SAME THAT IT IS NOW
87-121553-0044 AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
87-121553-0045 SO AT THAT ORISON DEVOUT AND PROMPT THE HOLY CIRCLES A NEW JOY DISPLAYED IN THEIR REVOLVING AND THEIR WONDROUS SONG WHOSO LAMENTETH HIM THAT HERE WE DIE THAT WE MAY LIVE ABOVE HAS NEVER THERE SEEN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE ETERNAL RAIN
87-121553-0046 THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
87-121553-0047 ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
87-121553-0048 FOR WILL INCREASE WHATE'ER BESTOWS ON US OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS THE GOOD SUPREME LIGHT WHICH ENABLES US TO LOOK ON HIM THEREFORE THE VISION MUST PERFORCE INCREASE INCREASE THE ARDOUR WHICH FROM THAT IS KINDLED INCREASE THE RADIANCE WHICH FROM THIS PROCEEDS
87-121553-0049 NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
87-121553-0050 NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
87-121553-0051 SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
87-121553-0052 BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
87-121553-0053 WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
87-121553-0054 AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
87-121553-0055 EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
87-121553-0056 HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
87-121553-0057 SO FROM THE LIGHTS THAT THERE TO ME APPEARED UPGATHERED THROUGH THE CROSS A MELODY WHICH RAPT ME NOT DISTINGUISHING THE HYMN WELL WAS I WARE IT WAS OF LOFTY LAUD BECAUSE THERE CAME TO ME ARISE AND CONQUER AS UNTO HIM WHO HEARS AND COMPREHENDS NOT
87-121553-0058 SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
87-121553-0059 BUT WHO BETHINKS HIM THAT THE LIVING SEALS OF EVERY BEAUTY GROW IN POWER ASCENDING AND THAT I THERE HAD NOT TURNED ROUND TO THOSE CAN ME EXCUSE IF I MYSELF ACCUSE TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND SEE THAT I SPEAK TRULY FOR HERE THE HOLY JOY IS NOT DISCLOSED
87-121553-0060 A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
87-121553-0061 THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
87-121553-0062 WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
87-121553-0063 AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
87-121553-0064 SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
87-121553-0065 THEN PLEASANT TO THE HEARING AND THE SIGHT THE SPIRIT JOINED TO ITS BEGINNING THINGS I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND IT SPAKE NOR DID IT HIDE ITSELF FROM ME BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY FOR ITS CONCEPTION ABOVE THE MARK OF MORTALS SET ITSELF
87-121553-0066 AND WHEN THE BOW OF BURNING SYMPATHY WAS SO FAR SLACKENED THAT ITS SPEECH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE MARK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE THE FIRST THING THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ME WAS BENEDIGHT BE THOU O TRINE AND ONE
87-121553-0067 WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
87-121553-0068 BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
87-121553-0069 WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
87-121553-0070 BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
87-121553-0071 OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
87-121553-0072 DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
87-121553-0073 THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
87-121553-0074 AND WHO A HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE HAS CIRCLED ROUND THE MOUNT ON THE FIRST CORNICE A SON OF MINE AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE WAS WELL IT BEHOVES THEE THAT THE LONG FATIGUE THOU SHOULDST FOR HIM MAKE SHORTER WITH THY WORKS FLORENCE WITHIN THE ANCIENT BOUNDARY
87-121553-0075 FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
87-121553-0076 NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
87-121553-0077 WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE

87-121553-0082 I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
87-121553-0083 O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
87-121553-0084 I SAY IN HEAVEN OF THEE I MADE A BOAST TRULY THOU ART A CLOAK THAT QUICKLY SHORTENS SO THAT UNLESS WE PIECE THEE DAY BY DAY TIME GOETH ROUND ABOUT THEE WITH HIS SHEARS WITH YOU WHICH ROME WAS FIRST TO TOLERATE
87-121553-0085 WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
87-121553-0086 AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
87-121553-0087 THEN TELL ME MY BELOVED ROOT ANCESTRAL WHO WERE YOUR ANCESTORS AND WHAT THE YEARS THAT IN YOUR BOYHOOD CHRONICLED THEMSELVES TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEEPFOLD OF SAINT JOHN HOW LARGE IT WAS AND WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN IT WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST SEATS
87-121553-0088 AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
87-121553-0089 FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
87-121553-0090 FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
87-121553-0091 BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
87-121553-0092 AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
87-121553-0093 SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
87-121553-0094 THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
87-121553-0095 IF LUNI THOU REGARD AND URBISAGLIA HOW THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND HOW ARE PASSING CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AFTER THEM TO HEAR HOW RACES WASTE THEMSELVES AWAY WILL SEEM TO THEE NO NOVEL THING NOR HARD
87-121553-0096 SEEING THAT EVEN CITIES HAVE AN END ALL THINGS OF YOURS HAVE THEIR MORTALITY EVEN AS YOURSELVES BUT IT IS HIDDEN IN SOME THAT A LONG WHILE ENDURE AND LIVES ARE SHORT AND AS THE TURNING OF THE LUNAR HEAVEN COVERS AND BARES THE SHORES WITHOUT A PAUSE
87-121553-0097 IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
87-121553-0098 EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
87-121553-0099 THAT SOON IT SHALL BE JETSAM FROM THE BARK THE RAVIGNANI WERE FROM WHOM DESCENDED THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOE'ER THE NAME OF THE GREAT BELLINCIONE SINCE HATH TAKEN HE OF LA PRESSA KNEW THE ART OF RULING ALREADY
87-121553-0100 AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH

87-121553-0102 SO LIKEWISE DID THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE WHO EVERMORE WHEN VACANT IS YOUR CHURCH FATTEN BY STAYING IN CONSISTORY THE INSOLENT RACE THAT LIKE A DRAGON FOLLOWS WHOEVER FLEES AND UNTO HIM THAT SHOWS HIS TEETH OR PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
87-121553-0103 ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
87-121553-0104 I'LL TELL A THING INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ONE ENTERED THE SMALL CIRCUIT BY A GATE WHICH FROM THE DELLA PERA TOOK ITS NAME EACH ONE THAT BEARS THE BEAUTIFUL ESCUTCHEON OF THE GREAT BARON WHOSE RENOWN AND NAME THE FESTIVAL OF THOMAS KEEPETH FRESH
87-121553-0105 KNIGHTHOOD AND PRIVILEGE FROM HIM RECEIVED THOUGH WITH THE POPULACE UNITES HIMSELF TO DAY THE MAN WHO BINDS IT WITH A BORDER ALREADY WERE GUALTEROTTI AND IMPORTUNI AND STILL MORE QUIET WOULD THE BORGO BE IF WITH NEW NEIGHBOURS IT REMAINED UNFED
87-121553-0106 MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
87-121553-0107 WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
103-1241-0000 CHAPTER TWO MATTHEW CUTHBERT IS SURPRISED MATTHEW CUTHBERT AND THE SORREL MARE JOGGED COMFORTABLY OVER THE EIGHT MILES TO BRIGHT RIVER IT WAS A PRETTY ROAD RUNNING ALONG BETWEEN SNUG FARMSTEADS WITH NOW AND AGAIN A BIT OF BALSAMY FIR WOOD TO DRIVE THROUGH
103-1241-0001 OR A HOLLOW WHERE WILD PLUMS HUNG OUT THEIR FILMY BLOOM THE AIR WAS SWEET WITH THE BREATH OF MANY APPLE ORCHARDS AND THE MEADOWS SLOPED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TO HORIZON MISTS OF PEARL AND PURPLE WHILE THE LITTLE BIRDS SANG AS IF IT WERE THE ONE DAY OF SUMMER IN ALL THE YEAR
103-1241-0002 MATTHEW ENJOYED THE DRIVE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION EXCEPT DURING THE MOMENTS WHEN HE MET WOMEN AND HAD TO NOD TO THEM FOR IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO NOD TO ALL AND SUNDRY YOU MEET ON THE ROAD WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM OR NOT MATTHEW DREADED ALL WOMEN EXCEPT MARILLA AND MISSUS RACHEL
103-1241-0003 HE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES WERE SECRETLY LAUGHING AT HIM HE MAY HAVE BEEN QUITE RIGHT IN THINKING SO FOR HE WAS AN ODD LOOKING PERSONAGE WITH AN UNGAINLY FIGURE AND LONG IRON GRAY HAIR THAT TOUCHED HIS STOOPING SHOULDERS
103-1241-0004 AND A FULL SOFT BROWN BEARD WHICH HE HAD WORN EVER SINCE HE WAS TWENTY IN FACT HE HAD LOOKED AT TWENTY VERY MUCH AS HE LOOKED AT SIXTY LACKING A LITTLE OF THE GRAYNESS WHEN HE REACHED BRIGHT RIVER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIN
103-1241-0005 HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO EARLY SO HE TIED HIS HORSE IN THE YARD OF THE SMALL BRIGHT RIVER HOTEL AND WENT OVER TO THE STATION HOUSE THE LONG PLATFORM WAS ALMOST DESERTED THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE IN SIGHT BEING A GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A PILE OF SHINGLES AT THE EXTREME END
103-1241-0006 MATTHEW BARELY NOTING THAT IT WAS A GIRL SIDLED PAST HER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER HAD HE LOOKED HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO NOTICE THE TENSE RIGIDITY AND EXPECTATION OF HER ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION SHE WAS SITTING THERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY
103-1241-0007 AND SINCE SITTING AND WAITING WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO JUST THEN SHE SAT AND WAITED WITH ALL HER MIGHT AND MAIN MATTHEW ENCOUNTERED THE STATIONMASTER LOCKING UP THE TICKET OFFICE PREPARATORY TO GOING HOME FOR SUPPER AND ASKED HIM IF THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN WOULD SOON BE ALONG
103-1241-0008 THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN HAS BEEN IN AND GONE HALF AN HOUR AGO ANSWERED THAT BRISK OFFICIAL BUT THERE WAS A PASSENGER DROPPED OFF FOR YOU A LITTLE GIRL SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE ON THE SHINGLES I ASKED HER TO GO INTO THE LADIES WAITING ROOM BUT SHE INFORMED ME GRAVELY THAT SHE PREFERRED TO STAY OUTSIDE
103-1241-0009 SHE'S A CASE I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A GIRL SAID MATTHEW BLANKLY IT'S A BOY I'VE COME FOR HE SHOULD BE HERE MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS TO BRING HIM OVER FROM NOVA SCOTIA FOR ME THE STATIONMASTER WHISTLED
103-1241-0010 GUESS THERE'S SOME MISTAKE HE SAID MISSUS SPENCER CAME OFF THE TRAIN WITH THAT GIRL AND GAVE HER INTO MY CHARGE SAID YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE ADOPTING HER FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WOULD BE ALONG FOR HER PRESENTLY THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE ORPHANS CONCEALED HEREABOUTS
103-1241-0011 I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID MATTHEW HELPLESSLY WISHING THAT MARILLA WAS AT HAND TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION WELL YOU'D BETTER QUESTION THE GIRL SAID THE STATION MASTER CARELESSLY I DARE SAY SHE'LL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN SHE'S GOT A TONGUE OF HER OWN THAT'S CERTAIN
103-1241-0012 MAYBE THEY WERE OUT OF BOYS OF THE BRAND YOU WANTED HE WALKED JAUNTILY AWAY BEING HUNGRY AND THE UNFORTUNATE MATTHEW WAS LEFT TO DO THAT WHICH WAS HARDER FOR HIM THAN BEARDING A LION IN ITS DEN WALK UP TO A GIRL A STRANGE GIRL AN ORPHAN GIRL
103-1241-0013 AND DEMAND OF HER WHY SHE WASN'T A BOY MATTHEW GROANED IN SPIRIT AS HE TURNED ABOUT AND SHUFFLED GENTLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS HER SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM EVER SINCE HE HAD PASSED HER AND SHE HAD HER EYES ON HIM NOW MATTHEW WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
103-1241-0014 A CHILD OF ABOUT ELEVEN GARBED IN A VERY SHORT VERY TIGHT VERY UGLY DRESS OF YELLOWISH GRAY WINCEY SHE WORE A FADED BROWN SAILOR HAT AND BENEATH THE HAT EXTENDING DOWN HER BACK WERE TWO BRAIDS OF VERY THICK DECIDEDLY RED HAIR
103-1241-0015 HER FACE WAS SMALL WHITE AND THIN ALSO MUCH FRECKLED HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND SO WERE HER EYES WHICH LOOKED GREEN IN SOME LIGHTS AND MOODS AND GRAY IN OTHERS SO FAR THE ORDINARY OBSERVER AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER
103-1241-0016 MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHIN WAS VERY POINTED AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE BIG EYES WERE FULL OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAT THE MOUTH WAS SWEET LIPPED AND EXPRESSIVE THAT THE FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND FULL IN SHORT OUR DISCERNING EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED
103-1241-0017 WAS SO LUDICROUSLY AFRAID MATTHEW HOWEVER WAS SPARED THE ORDEAL OF SPEAKING FIRST FOR AS SOON AS SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS COMING TO HER SHE STOOD UP GRASPING WITH ONE THIN BROWN HAND THE HANDLE OF A SHABBY OLD FASHIONED CARPET BAG THE OTHER SHE HELD OUT TO HIM
103-1241-0018 I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MISTER MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF GREEN GABLES SHE SAID IN A PECULIARLY CLEAR SWEET VOICE I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU I WAS BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID YOU WEREN'T COMING FOR ME
103-1241-0019 I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF YOU DIDN'T COME FOR ME TO NIGHT
103-1241-0020 I WOULDN'T BE A BIT AFRAID AND IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE ALL WHITE WITH BLOOM IN THE MOONSHINE DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU WERE DWELLING IN MARBLE HALLS COULDN'T YOU
103-1241-0021 MATTHEW HAD TAKEN THE SCRAWNY LITTLE HAND AWKWARDLY IN HIS THEN AND THERE HE DECIDED WHAT TO DO HE COULD NOT TELL THIS CHILD WITH THE GLOWING EYES THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MISTAKE HE WOULD TAKE HER HOME AND LET MARILLA DO THAT SHE COULDN'T BE LEFT AT BRIGHT RIVER ANYHOW
103-1241-0022 NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE SO ALL QUESTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS MIGHT AS WELL BE DEFERRED UNTIL HE WAS SAFELY BACK AT GREEN GABLES I'M SORRY I WAS LATE HE SAID SHYLY COME ALONG THE HORSE IS OVER IN THE YARD GIVE ME YOUR BAG OH I CAN CARRY IT THE CHILD RESPONDED CHEERFULLY
103-1241-0023 IT ISN'T HEAVY I'VE GOT ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS IN IT BUT IT ISN'T HEAVY AND IF IT ISN'T CARRIED IN JUST A CERTAIN WAY THE HANDLE PULLS OUT SO I'D BETTER KEEP IT BECAUSE I KNOW THE EXACT KNACK OF IT IT'S AN EXTREMELY OLD CARPET BAG OH I'M VERY GLAD YOU'VE COME EVEN IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE
103-1241-0024 WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
103-1241-0025 IT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS WICKED OF ME TO TALK LIKE THAT
103-1241-0026 THEY WERE GOOD YOU KNOW THE ASYLUM PEOPLE BUT THERE IS SO LITTLE SCOPE FOR THE IMAGINATION IN AN ASYLUM ONLY JUST IN THE OTHER ORPHANS IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING TO IMAGINE THINGS ABOUT THEM
103-1241-0027 WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN AWAY FROM HER PARENTS IN HER INFANCY BY A CRUEL NURSE WHO DIED BEFORE SHE COULD CONFESS I USED TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHTS AND IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE DAY I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M SO THIN I AM DREADFUL THIN AIN'T I THERE ISN'T A PICK ON MY BONES
103-1241-0028 I DO LOVE TO IMAGINE I'M NICE AND PLUMP WITH DIMPLES IN MY ELBOWS WITH THIS MATTHEW'S COMPANION STOPPED TALKING PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT OF BREATH AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED THE BUGGY NOT ANOTHER WORD DID SHE SAY UNTIL THEY HAD LEFT THE VILLAGE AND WERE DRIVING DOWN A STEEP LITTLE HILL
103-1241-0029 THE ROAD PART OF WHICH HAD BEEN CUT SO DEEPLY INTO THE SOFT SOIL THAT THE BANKS FRINGED WITH BLOOMING WILD CHERRY TREES AND SLIM WHITE BIRCHES WERE SEVERAL FEET ABOVE THEIR HEADS THE CHILD PUT OUT HER HAND AND BROKE OFF A BRANCH OF WILD PLUM THAT BRUSHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BUGGY
103-1241-0030 ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
103-1241-0031 I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE I DON'T EVER EXPECT TO BE A BRIDE MYSELF I'M SO HOMELY NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MARRY ME UNLESS IT MIGHT BE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY I SUPPOSE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY MIGHTN'T BE VERY PARTICULAR
103-1241-0032 BUT I DO HOPE THAT SOME DAY I SHALL HAVE A WHITE DRESS THAT IS MY HIGHEST IDEAL OF EARTHLY BLISS I JUST LOVE PRETTY CLOTHES AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PRETTY DRESS IN MY LIFE THAT I CAN REMEMBER BUT OF COURSE IT'S ALL THE MORE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ISN'T IT AND THEN
103-1241-0033 I CAN IMAGINE THAT I'M DRESSED GORGEOUSLY THIS MORNING WHEN I LEFT THE ASYLUM I FELT SO ASHAMED BECAUSE I HAD TO WEAR THIS HORRID OLD WINCEY DRESS ALL THE ORPHANS HAD TO WEAR THEM YOU KNOW A MERCHANT IN HOPETON LAST WINTER DONATED THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF WINCEY TO THE ASYLUM SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SELL IT
103-1241-0034 BUT I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART WOULDN'T YOU WHEN WE GOT ON THE TRAIN I FELT AS IF EVERYBODY MUST BE LOOKING AT ME AND PITYING ME BUT I JUST WENT TO WORK AND IMAGINED THAT I HAD ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE SILK DRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING YOU MIGHT AS WELL IMAGINE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
103-1241-0035 AND A BIG HAT ALL FLOWERS AND NODDING PLUMES AND A GOLD WATCH AND KID GLOVES AND BOOTS I FELT CHEERED UP RIGHT AWAY AND I ENJOYED MY TRIP TO THE ISLAND WITH ALL MY MIGHT I WASN'T A BIT SICK COMING OVER IN THE BOAT NEITHER WAS MISSUS SPENCER ALTHOUGH SHE GENERALLY IS
103-1241-0036 SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
103-1241-0037 OH THERE ARE A LOT MORE CHERRY TREES ALL IN BLOOM THIS ISLAND IS THE BLOOMIEST PLACE I JUST LOVE IT ALREADY AND I'M SO GLAD I'M GOING TO LIVE HERE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND WAS THE PRETTIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
103-1241-0038 AND I USED TO IMAGINE I WAS LIVING HERE BUT I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED I WOULD IT'S DELIGHTFUL WHEN YOUR IMAGINATIONS COME TRUE ISN'T IT BUT THOSE RED ROADS ARE SO FUNNY WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TRAIN AT CHARLOTTETOWN AND THE RED ROADS BEGAN TO FLASH PAST I ASKED MISSUS SPENCER WHAT MADE THEM RED
103-1241-0039 AND SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW AND FOR PITY'S SAKE NOT TO ASK HER ANY MORE QUESTIONS SHE SAID I MUST HAVE ASKED HER A THOUSAND ALREADY I SUPPOSE I HAD TOO BUT HOW YOU GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS IF YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AND WHAT DOES MAKE THE ROADS RED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW
103-1241-0040 THERE'D BE NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION THEN WOULD THERE BUT AM I TALKING TOO MUCH PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME I DO WOULD YOU RATHER I DIDN'T TALK IF YOU SAY SO I'LL STOP I CAN STOP WHEN I MAKE UP MY MIND TO IT ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT MATTHEW
103-1241-0041 WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF LIKE MOST QUIET FOLKS HE LIKED TALKATIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THE TALKING THEMSELVES AND DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO KEEP UP HIS END OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO ENJOY THE SOCIETY OF A LITTLE GIRL WOMEN WERE BAD ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE BUT LITTLE GIRLS WERE WORSE
103-1241-0042 HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
103-1241-0043 AND ALTHOUGH HE FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT FOR HIS SLOWER INTELLIGENCE TO KEEP UP WITH HER BRISK MENTAL PROCESSES
6529-62556-0000 AT HERBERT'S CRY PENCROFT LETTING HIS GUN FALL RUSHED TOWARDS HIM THEY HAVE KILLED HIM HE CRIED MY BOY THEY HAVE KILLED HIM CYRUS HARDING AND GIDEON SPILETT RAN TO HERBERT THE REPORTER LISTENED TO ASCERTAIN IF THE POOR LAD'S HEART WAS STILL BEATING
6529-62556-0001 HE LIVES SAID HE BUT HE MUST BE CARRIED TO GRANITE HOUSE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED THE ENGINEER INTO THE CORRAL THEN SAID PENCROFT IN A MOMENT SAID HARDING AND HE RAN ROUND THE LEFT CORNER OF THE PALISADE
6529-62556-0002 THERE HE FOUND A CONVICT WHO AIMING AT HIM SENT A BALL THROUGH HIS HAT IN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE HAD EVEN TIME TO FIRE HIS SECOND BARREL HE FELL STRUCK TO THE HEART BY HARDING'S DAGGER MORE SURE EVEN THAN HIS GUN DURING THIS TIME
6529-62556-0003 GIDEON SPILETT AND THE SAILOR HOISTED THEMSELVES OVER THE PALISADE LEAPED INTO THE ENCLOSURE THREW DOWN THE PROPS WHICH SUPPORTED THE INNER DOOR RAN INTO THE EMPTY HOUSE AND SOON POOR HERBERT WAS LYING ON AYRTON'S BED IN A FEW MOMENTS HARDING WAS BY HIS SIDE
6529-62556-0004 ON SEEING HERBERT SENSELESS THE SAILOR'S GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE HE SOBBED HE CRIED HE TRIED TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE REPORTER COULD CALM HIM
6529-62556-0005 WITHOUT ACQUIRING SOME SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE HE KNEW A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND SEVERAL TIMES HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ATTEND TO WOUNDS PRODUCED EITHER BY A SWORD BAYONET OR SHOT ASSISTED BY CYRUS HARDING HE PROCEEDED TO RENDER THE AID HERBERT REQUIRED
6529-62556-0006 THE REPORTER WAS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE STUPOR IN WHICH HERBERT LAY A STUPOR OWING EITHER TO THE HEMORRHAGE OR TO THE SHOCK THE BALL HAVING STRUCK A BONE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO PRODUCE A VIOLENT CONCUSSION HERBERT WAS DEADLY PALE AND HIS PULSE SO FEEBLE
6529-62556-0007 THAT SPILETT ONLY FELT IT BEAT AT LONG INTERVALS AS IF IT WAS ON THE POINT OF STOPPING THESE SYMPTOMS WERE VERY SERIOUS HERBERT'S CHEST WAS LAID BARE AND THE BLOOD HAVING BEEN STANCHED WITH HANDKERCHIEFS IT WAS BATHED WITH COLD WATER
6529-62556-0008 HE UTTERED A MOAN SO FEEBLE THAT THEY ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS HIS LAST SIGH HERBERTS BACK WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM ANOTHER CONTUSED WOUND BY WHICH THE BALL HAD IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED GOD BE PRAISED SAID THE REPORTER THE BALL IS NOT IN THE BODY AND WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO EXTRACT IT
6529-62556-0009 BUT THE HEART ASKED HARDING THE HEART HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED IF IT HAD BEEN HERBERT WOULD BE DEAD DEAD EXCLAIMED PENCROFT WITH A GROAN THE SAILOR HAD ONLY HEARD THE LAST WORDS UTTERED BY THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0010 NO PENCROFT REPLIED CYRUS HARDING NO HE IS NOT DEAD HIS PULSE STILL BEATS HE HAS EVEN UTTERED A MOAN BUT FOR YOUR BOY'S SAKE CALM YOURSELF WE HAVE NEED OF ALL OUR SELF POSSESSION DO NOT MAKE US LOSE IT MY FRIEND
6529-62556-0011 PENCROFT WAS SILENT BUT A REACTION SET IN AND GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS IN THE MEANWHILE GIDEON SPILETT ENDEAVORED TO COLLECT HIS IDEAS AND PROCEED METHODICALLY AFTER HIS EXAMINATION HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE BALL
6529-62556-0012 ENTERING IN FRONT BETWEEN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH RIBS HAD ISSUED BEHIND BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH BUT WHAT MISCHIEF HAD THE BALL COMMITTED IN ITS PASSAGE WHAT IMPORTANT ORGANS HAD BEEN REACHED A PROFESSIONAL SURGEON WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THIS AT ONCE
6529-62556-0013 AND STILL MORE SO THE REPORTER HOWEVER HE KNEW ONE THING THIS WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THE INFLAMMATORY STRANGULATION OF THE INJURED PARTS THEN TO CONTEND WITH THE LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND FEVER WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM THE WOUND PERHAPS MORTAL
6529-62556-0014 NOW WHAT STYPTICS WHAT ANTIPHLOGISTICS OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED BY WHAT MEANS COULD INFLAMMATION BE PREVENTED AT ANY RATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT DELAY
6529-62556-0015 IT DID NOT APPEAR NECESSARY TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT A FRESH FLOW OF BLOOD SHOULD BE CAUSED BY BATHING THEM IN TEPID WATER AND COMPRESSING THEIR LIPS THE HEMORRHAGE HAD BEEN VERY ABUNDANT AND HERBERT WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY THE LOSS OF BLOOD
6529-62556-0016 THE REPORTER THEREFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SIMPLY BATHE THE TWO WOUNDS WITH COLD WATER HERBERT WAS PLACED ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND WAS MAINTAINED IN THAT POSITION HE MUST NOT BE MOVED SAID GIDEON SPILETT
6529-62556-0017 HE IS IN THE MOST FAVORABLE POSITION FOR THE WOUNDS IN HIS BACK AND CHEST TO SUPPURATE EASILY AND ABSOLUTE REST IS NECESSARY WHAT CAN'T WE CARRY HIM TO GRANITE HOUSE ASKED PENCROFT NO PENCROFT REPLIED THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0018 CYRUS SAID HE I AM NOT A SURGEON I AM IN TERRIBLE PERPLEXITY YOU MUST AID ME WITH YOUR ADVICE YOUR EXPERIENCE TAKE COURAGE MY FRIEND ANSWERED THE ENGINEER PRESSING THE REPORTER'S HAND JUDGE COOLLY
6529-62556-0019 THINK ONLY OF THIS HERBERT MUST BE SAVED THESE WORDS RESTORED TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT SELF POSSESSION WHICH HE HAD LOST IN A MOMENT OF DISCOURAGEMENT ON FEELING HIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY HE SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE BED CYRUS HARDING STOOD NEAR
6529-62556-0020 PENCROFT HAD TORN UP HIS SHIRT AND WAS MECHANICALLY MAKING LINT SPILETT THEN EXPLAINED TO CYRUS HARDING THAT HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT FIRST OF ALL TO STOP THE HEMORRHAGE BUT NOT CLOSE THE TWO WOUNDS OR CAUSE THEIR IMMEDIATE CICATRIZATION FOR THERE HAD BEEN INTERNAL PERFORATION
6529-62556-0021 AND THE SUPPURATION MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE IN THE CHEST HARDING APPROVED ENTIRELY AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO CLOSE THEM BY IMMEDIATE COAPTATION AND NOW
6529-62556-0022 DID THE COLONISTS POSSESS AN EFFICACIOUS AGENT TO ACT AGAINST THE INFLAMMATION WHICH MIGHT OCCUR YES THEY HAD ONE FOR NATURE HAD GENEROUSLY LAVISHED IT THEY HAD COLD WATER THAT IS TO SAY THE MOST POWERFUL SEDATIVE THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED AGAINST INFLAMMATION OF WOUNDS
6529-62556-0023 THE MOST EFFICACIOUS THERAPEUTIC AGENT IN GRAVE CASES AND THE ONE WHICH IS NOW ADOPTED BY ALL PHYSICIANS COLD WATER HAS MOREOVER THE ADVANTAGE OF LEAVING THE WOUND IN ABSOLUTE REST AND PRESERVING IT FROM ALL PREMATURE DRESSING A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE
6529-62556-0024 SINCE IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT CONTACT WITH THE AIR IS DANGEROUS DURING THE FIRST DAYS GIDEON SPILETT AND CYRUS HARDING REASONED THUS WITH THEIR SIMPLE GOOD SENSE AND THEY ACTED AS THE BEST SURGEON WOULD HAVE DONE
6529-62556-0025 COMPRESSES OF LINEN WERE APPLIED TO POOR HERBERT'S TWO WOUNDS AND WERE KEPT CONSTANTLY WET WITH COLD WATER THE SAILOR HAD AT FIRST LIGHTED A FIRE IN THE HUT WHICH WAS NOT WANTING IN THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIFE MAPLE SUGAR MEDICINAL PLANTS
6529-62556-0026 THE SAME WHICH THE LAD HAD GATHERED ON THE BANKS OF LAKE GRANT ENABLED THEM TO MAKE SOME REFRESHING DRINKS WHICH THEY GAVE HIM WITHOUT HIS TAKING ANY NOTICE OF IT HIS FEVER WAS EXTREMELY HIGH AND ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT HIS BECOMING CONSCIOUS
6529-62556-0027 HERBERT'S LIFE HUNG ON A THREAD AND THIS THREAD MIGHT BREAK AT ANY MOMENT THE NEXT DAY THE TWELFTH OF NOVEMBER THE HOPES OF HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS SLIGHTLY REVIVED HERBERT HAD COME OUT OF HIS LONG STUPOR HE OPENED HIS EYES HE RECOGNIZED CYRUS HARDING
6529-62556-0028 THE REPORTER AND PENCROFT HE UTTERED TWO OR THREE WORDS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY TOLD HIM AND SPILETT BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN PERFECTLY STILL TELLING HIM THAT HIS LIFE WAS NOT IN DANGER AND THAT HIS WOUNDS WOULD HEAL IN A FEW DAYS
6529-62556-0029 HOWEVER HERBERT SCARCELY SUFFERED AT ALL AND THE COLD WATER WITH WHICH THEY WERE CONSTANTLY BATHED PREVENTED ANY INFLAMMATION OF THE WOUNDS THE SUPPURATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN A REGULAR WAY THE FEVER DID NOT INCREASE
6529-62556-0030 AND IT MIGHT NOW BE HOPED THAT THIS TERRIBLE WOUND WOULD NOT INVOLVE ANY CATASTROPHE PENCROFT FELT THE SWELLING OF HIS HEART GRADUALLY SUBSIDE HE WAS LIKE A SISTER OF MERCY LIKE A MOTHER BY THE BED OF HER CHILD
6529-62556-0031 HERBERT DOZED AGAIN BUT HIS SLEEP APPEARED MORE NATURAL TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU HOPE MISTER SPILETT SAID PENCROFT TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU WILL SAVE HERBERT YES WE WILL SAVE HIM REPLIED THE REPORTER THE WOUND IS SERIOUS AND PERHAPS
6529-62556-0032 EVEN THE BALL HAS TRAVERSED THE LUNGS BUT THE PERFORATION OF THIS ORGAN IS NOT FATAL GOD BLESS YOU ANSWERED PENCROFT AS MAY BE BELIEVED DURING THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CORRAL THE COLONISTS HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF NURSING HERBERT
6529-62556-0033 THEY DID NOT THINK EITHER OF THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEM SHOULD THE CONVICTS RETURN OR OF THE PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN FOR THE FUTURE BUT ON THIS DAY WHILE PENCROFT WATCHED BY THE SICK BED CYRUS HARDING AND THE REPORTER CONSULTED AS TO WHAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO DO
6529-62556-0034 AT THE MOMENT HE SCALED THE PALISADE HAD CLEARLY SEEN SOME ONE OF THE CONVICTS RUNNING ALONG THE SOUTHERN SPUR OF MOUNT FRANKLIN TOWARDS WHOM TOP HAD SPRUNG IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE OBJECT HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY DEFEATED BY THE ROCKS AT THE MOUTH OF THE MERCY
6529-62556-0035 AND AS HE WAS A MAN TO DEFEND HIMSELF HE MUST HAVE BEEN OVERPOWERED YES THAT IS TO BE FEARED SAID THE REPORTER THEN DOUBTLESS THE CONVICTS INSTALLED THEMSELVES IN THE CORRAL WHERE THEY FOUND PLENTY OF EVERYTHING AND ONLY FLED WHEN THEY SAW US COMING
6529-62556-0036 IT IS VERY EVIDENT TOO THAT AT THIS MOMENT AYRTON WHETHER LIVING OR DEAD IS NOT HERE WE SHALL HAVE TO BEAT THE FOREST SAID THE ENGINEER AND RID THE ISLAND OF THESE WRETCHES PENCROFT'S PRESENTIMENTS WERE NOT MISTAKEN WHEN HE WISHED TO HUNT THEM AS WILD BEASTS
6529-62556-0037 THAT WOULD HAVE SPARED US ALL THESE MISFORTUNES YES ANSWERED THE REPORTER BUT NOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MERCILESS AT ANY RATE SAID THE ENGINEER WE ARE OBLIGED TO WAIT SOME TIME AND TO REMAIN AT THE CORRAL UNTIL WE CAN CARRY HERBERT WITHOUT DANGER TO GRANITE HOUSE
6529-62556-0038 HE MUST NOT COME RETURNED CYRUS HARDING QUICKLY HE WOULD BE MURDERED ON THE ROAD IT IS VERY PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT HE WILL ATTEMPT TO REJOIN US AH IF THE TELEGRAPH STILL ACTED HE MIGHT BE WARNED BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW
6529-62556-0039 AS TO LEAVING PENCROFT AND HERBERT HERE ALONE WE COULD NOT DO IT WELL I WILL GO ALONE TO GRANITE HOUSE NO NO CYRUS ANSWERED THE REPORTER YOU MUST NOT EXPOSE YOURSELF YOUR COURAGE WOULD BE OF NO AVAIL THE VILLAINS ARE EVIDENTLY WATCHING THE CORRAL
6529-62556-0040 THEY ARE HIDDEN IN THE THICK WOODS WHICH SURROUND IT AND IF YOU GO WE SHALL SOON HAVE TO REGRET TWO MISFORTUNES INSTEAD OF ONE
6529-62556-0041 IT IS NOW FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS SINCE HE HAS HAD ANY NEWS OF US HE WILL BE SURE TO COME AND AS HE WILL BE LESS ON HIS GUARD THAN WE SHOULD BE OURSELVES ADDED SPILETT HE WILL BE KILLED IS THERE REALLY NO WAY OF WARNING HIM
6529-62556-0042 WHO HAD UNDERSTOOD THE ENGINEER TOP CAN GO WHERE WE CANNOT HE WILL CARRY TO GRANITE HOUSE THE NEWS OF THE CORRAL AND HE WILL BRING BACK TO US THAT FROM GRANITE HOUSE QUICK SAID HARDING QUICK SPILETT RAPIDLY TORE A LEAF FROM HIS NOTE BOOK AND WROTE THESE WORDS

6529-62556-0044 GO GO TOP BOUNDED AT THESE WORDS HE UNDERSTOOD HE KNEW WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM THE ROAD TO THE CORRAL WAS FAMILIAR TO HIM
6529-62556-0045 TOP RUNNING AMONG THE GRASS OR IN THE WOOD WOULD PASS UNPERCEIVED THE ENGINEER WENT TO THE GATE OF THE CORRAL AND OPENED IT
6529-62556-0046 TOP SPRANG FORWARDS THEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED HE WILL GET THERE SAID THE REPORTER YES AND HE WILL COME BACK THE FAITHFUL ANIMAL WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT ASKED GIDEON SPILETT TEN

6529-62556-0048 SEEING THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO AT THAT MOMENT BUSIED HIMSELF IN PREPARING SOME NOURISHMENT WHILE ATTENTIVELY WATCHING THAT PART OF THE ENCLOSURE AGAINST THE HILL AT WHICH AN ATTACK MIGHT BE EXPECTED THE SETTLERS AWAITED TOP'S RETURN WITH MUCH ANXIETY
6529-62556-0049 A LITTLE BEFORE ELEVEN O'CLOCK CYRUS HARDING AND THE REPORTER RIFLE IN HAND WERE BEHIND THE GATE READY TO OPEN IT AT THE FIRST BARK OF THEIR DOG THEY DID NOT DOUBT THAT IF TOP HAD ARRIVED SAFELY AT GRANITE HOUSE
2817-142380-0000 WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
2817-142380-0001 THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
2817-142380-0002 HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
2817-142380-0003 SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
2817-142380-0004 LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
2817-142380-0005 YES ADAM I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION
2817-142380-0006 IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
2817-142380-0007 WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
2817-142380-0008 IF THEY NOW URGE YOU STRONGLY TO GO AND SEE HER TO MORROW MORNING EVEN WITHOUT HER CONSENT
2817-142380-0009 THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
2817-142380-0010 AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
2817-142380-0011 AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
2817-142380-0012 AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST NO HE IS NOT SAID MISTER IRWINE QUIETLY LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
2817-142380-0013 I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
2817-142380-0014 I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS IT'S HIS WORK SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT AND HE SHALL KNOW IT HE SHALL FEEL IT
2817-142380-0015 TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
2817-142380-0016 HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
2817-142380-0017 HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH I AM PERSUADED
2817-142380-0018 ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
2817-142380-0019 BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
2817-142380-0020 SMILING UP AT ME I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MISTER IRWINE
2817-142380-0021 BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
2817-142380-0022 IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
2817-142380-0023 THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
2817-142380-0024 EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM
2817-142380-0025 YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
2817-142380-0026 FOR IT IS PASSION AND YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IN CALLING IT JUSTICE IT MIGHT BE WITH YOU PRECISELY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH ARTHUR NAY WORSE YOUR PASSION MIGHT LEAD YOU YOURSELF INTO A HORRIBLE CRIME
2817-142380-0027 NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
2817-142380-0028 AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
2817-142380-0029 HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
2817-142380-0030 NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF
2817-142380-0031 AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF
2817-142380-0032 I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL
2817-142380-0033 ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
2817-142380-0034 AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
2817-142380-0035 AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MISTER IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS
2817-142380-0036 WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
2817-142380-0037 IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
2817-142380-0038 IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
2817-142380-0039 BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS
2817-142380-0040 SINCE THEY WON'T COME NIGH HER THEMSELVES BUT I THINK SHE WOULD FOR THE METHODISTS ARE GREAT FOLKS FOR GOING INTO THE PRISONS AND SETH SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD SHE'D A VERY TENDER WAY WITH HER DINAH HAD
2817-142380-0041 YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER
2817-142380-0042 IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MISTER IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW TRY TO GET SOME REST TO NIGHT
3235-28452-0000 ON THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF JUNE I AWOKE TO FIND THAT THE ICE HAD DRIFTED OUT TO SEA IN THE NIGHT EIGHT DAYS AFTER MOLLIE AND I HAD TAKEN OUR TWELVE MILES TRIP ACROSS THE BAY AND RETURN
3235-28452-0001 THEN CAME HARD RAIN AND WIND THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BLEW THE ICE BACK INTO THE BAY FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER SO THAT THE STEAMERS WAITING TO COME IN COULD NOT DO SO FOR FEAR OF THE DRIFTING FLOES
3235-28452-0002 BY THE THIRTIETH OF JUNE SCHOONERS WERE COMING INTO THE BAY WITH PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT AND THE COAST STEAMERS ELMORE AND DORA HAD BEGUN TO MAKE REGULAR TRIPS TO AND FROM NOME WITH THEM CAME MAILS FROM THE OUTSIDE
3235-28452-0003 WITH NEWSPAPERS AND TIDINGS OF FRIENDS IN THE STATES THEN OUR FINGERS TREMBLED AT OPENING OUR LETTERS UNTIL WE FOUND THAT ALL OUR DEAR ONES WERE WELL AND WE HEARTILY THANKED THE LORD
3235-28452-0004 THERE WERE OTHER WHITE WOMEN IN CAMP BY THIS TIME AND MANY STRANGERS AT THE HOTEL AMONG OTHERS OFFICIALS AND THOSE IN AUTHORITY SINCE THE STONE THROWING EPISODE THE MARSHAL HAD BEEN DOING DUTY AS WATCHMAN
3235-28452-0005 SLEEPING DURING THE DAY AND GUARDING THE HOUSE NIGHTS THE HEAVY IRON BRACELETS IN HIS INNER COAT POCKET WEIGHING SCARCELY MORE THAN THE LOADED REVOLVER IN HIS BELT
3235-28452-0006 OUR LITTLE SICK GIRL BEING OBLIGED NOW TO KEEP HER BED CONTINUALLY WITH NO MORE PLAYING IN THE SAND AND SUNSHINE ALTHOUGH HER COUGH HAD LEFT HER WAS STILL THE SAME SWEET PATIENT CHILD SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH ALL HER ILLNESS
3235-28452-0007 AND MY WHOLE TIME WAS GIVEN TO HER BEFORE ONE OF THE SUNNY SOUTH WINDOWS OF THE LIVING ROOM WE PLACED HER COT EACH MORNING AND HERE SHE RECEIVED HER NUMEROUS FRIENDS BOTH ESKIMO AND WHITE AND THEIR NAMES WERE LEGION
3235-28452-0008 THEY CAME FROM THE EAST WEST NORTH AND SOUTH ALL SORRY TO KNOW OF HER ILLNESS AND BRINGING PRESENTS WITH THEM SOMETIMES IT WAS A LITTLE LIVE BIRD OR SQUIRREL A DELICIOUS SALMON TROUT
3235-28452-0009 OR WILD FOWL FOR HER SUPPER SOMETIMES IT WAS CANDY NUTS OR FRESH FRUIT FROM NOME AND WITH EVERYTHING SHE WAS WELL PLEASED AND JOYOUS FRIENDS SOON CAME IN FROM THE OUTSIDE BRINGING CITY DOLLS DRESSED IN RIBBONS AND LACES
3235-28452-0010 THERE WERE TINY DISHES CHAIRS TABLES A HUNDRED THINGS DEAR TO A LITTLE GIRL'S HEART AND ALL PLEASED HER IMMENSELY BUT ALL WERE LAID QUICKLY ASIDE FOR A BASKET OF WILD FLOWERS OR MOSSES
3235-28452-0011 FOR A FISH BIRD ANIMAL OR BABY SHOWING PLAINLY HER TASTE FOR THE THINGS OF NATURE IN PREFERENCE TO ART HER LOVE FOR HER BIRTHPLACE WITH ITS HILLS STREAMS AND OCEAN IS A SINCERE ONE
3235-28452-0012 AND YOUNG AS SHE IS AND HAVING SEEN THE GREAT CITY BY THE GOLDEN GATE WITH MANY OF ITS WONDERS SHE IS HAPPIEST IN CHINIK HERE LIVES HER DEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER HER COUSINS AND AUNTS
3235-28452-0013 FOR WHICH SHE HAS A WHOLE HEARTFUL OF LOVE AND THE SIGHT OF WHICH IS BETTER TO HER THAN MEDICINE DURING THE MONTH OF JULY WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE INCOMING STEAMERS AND WELCOMED ALL NEW COMERS WHO LANDED IN CHINIK
3235-28452-0014 MANY WERE SIMPLY PASSING THROUGH ON THEIR WAY UP FISH RIVER TO THE MINES
3235-28452-0015 A FEW REMAINED FOR THE SUMMER HERE MEN BUILT BOATS AND ROWED AWAY TO KEECHAWIK AND NEUKLUK CARRYING SUPPLIES FOR HUNTING OR PROSPECTING THE CAPTAIN'S VEGETABLE GARDEN IN THE SAND WAS GROWING RAPIDLY
3235-28452-0016 AND WAS WATCHED WITH EAGER EYES BY EVERYONE WE ATE LETTUCE AND RADISHES PICKED FRESH FROM THE GARDEN BEDS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SOWN BY THE CAPTAIN'S OWN HANDS AND WE FOUND AGEETUK AND MOLLIE TO BE QUITE FAMOUS COOKS
3235-28452-0017 NOTHING SO DELICIOUS AS THEIR SALADS FOR THE FRENCH COOKS HAD LONG AGO GONE THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT BEING CHANGED AND MOLLIE HAD A NICE LITTLE KITCHEN OF HER OWN AND WITH FRESH SALMON TROUT WILD FOWL
3235-28452-0018 FRESH MEATS AND VEGETABLES WE MADE UP FOR MANY MONTHS OF WINTER DIETING ALL THIS TIME I LONGED TO GET AWAY I WAS GOING EACH DAY TO THE HILL TOP TO WATCH FOR THE STEAMERS WHICH WOULD BRING THE LETTERS FOR WHICH I WAITED
3235-28452-0019 AFFAIRS CONNECTED WITH MY GOLD CLAIMS WERE WITH
3235-28452-0020 ARRANGED AS WELL AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN I BOARDED THE STEAMER I WOULD CARRY WITH ME AT LEAST THREE DEEDS TO AS MANY CLAIMS WITH A FAIR PROSPECT OF OTHERS BUT I COULD NOT DECIDE TO REMAIN ANOTHER WINTER
3235-28452-0021 I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO SAINT MICHAEL UP THE YUKON TO DAWSON AND OUTSIDE AND LAID MY PLANS ACCORDINGLY
3235-28452-0022 THE LATTER NOW GROWN WILFUL BUT STILL SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY I WANTED TO TAKE BOTH WITH ME BUT NO I COULD NOT THE LITTLE GIRL'S WORK WAS NOT ENDED
3235-28452-0023 AND SHE IS SURELY ABOUT TO FULFILL IT BORN AS SHE WAS IN A ROUGH MINING CAMP AT THE FOOT OF THE BARREN HILLS SHE WAS GIVEN THE ESKIMO NAME OF YAHKUK MEANING A LITTLE HILL
3235-28452-0024 AND SHE LIKE AN OASIS IN A DESERT PLACE IS LEFT HERE TO CHEER LOVE AND HELP OTHERS MANY TIMES I HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF THE SWEET AND GENTLE INFLUENCES GOING OUT FROM THE LIFE OF LITTLE YAHKUK
3235-28452-0025 AS SHE LIES UPON HER COT OF PAIN A TALL BROWN MINER ENTERS THE LIVING ROOM GOES TO THE LITTLE BED BY THE WINDOW SPEAKS SOFTLY AND BENDING OVER THE TINY GIRL KISSES HER
3235-28452-0026 THEN HER BIG BLACK EYES GLANCE BRIGHTLY INTO BLUE ONES LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE FULL RED LIPS PART IN A CORDIAL SMILE WHILE THE ONE SOLITARY DIMPLE IN THE SMOOTH ROUND CHEEK
3235-28452-0027 PRICKS ITS WAY STILL DEEPER AND SMALL ARMS GO UP AROUND HIS NECK WHEN THE MAN TURNS HIS FACE WEARS A SOFT AND TENDER EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE WERE LOOKING AT SOME BEAUTIFUL SIGHT FAR AWAY
3235-28452-0028 AND PERHAPS HE IS GOD GRANT THAT THE SWEET MEMORY OF THAT LITTLE CHILD'S KISS MAY BE SO LASTING THAT ALL THEIR LIVES HE AND OTHERS MAY BE PURER AND BETTER MEN
3235-28452-0029 WHEN AUGUST CAME I SAILED AWAY THE DORA HAD ENTERED THE BAY IN THE MORNING AND FOUND MY TRUNK PACKED AND WAITING IT WAS THEN ONLY THE WORK OF A LITTLE TIME TO MAKE READY TO LEAVE
3235-28452-0030 TO MY GOOD MISSIONARY FRIENDS I HAD ALREADY SAID GOOD BYE AND THE CAPTAIN AND MOLLIE WERE KINDLY REGRETFUL WITH TEARS IN MY EYES BUT WITH REAL PAIN IN MY HEART I BADE JENNIE GOOD BYE
3235-28452-0031 AND STEPPED INTO THE LITTLE BOAT WHICH WAS TO CARRY ME TO THE DORA FAREWELL THEN TO CHINIK THE HOME OF THE NORTH WIND AND BLIZZARD FAREWELL TO THE ICE FIELDS OF GOLOVIN
3235-28452-0032 SO TARDY IN LEAVING IN SUMMER AND TO KEECHAWIK AND CHINIK WHOSE CLEAR RUSHING WATERS SO CHEERED US IN SPRING TIME FAREWELL TO THE MOSS COVERED HILLS AND PATHS THICKLY BORDERED WITH BLOSSOMS
3235-28452-0033 FAREWELL TO MY WHITE FACED FRIENDS AND TO THE DARK SKINNED ONES
3235-28433-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN GOING TO NOME ONE BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN HUNDRED I SAILED AGAIN FOR ALASKA THIS TIME FOR NOME FROM SAN FRANCISCO
3235-28433-0001 AN ENGLISH FAMILY CONSISTING OF THE MOTHER ONE SON AND A DAUGHTER WERE TO ACCOMPANY ME AND WE HAD SPENT WEEKS IN MAKING OUR PREPARATIONS WE WERE TAKING SUPPLIES OF CLOTHING FOOD
3235-28433-0002 TENTS AND BEDDING SUFFICIENT TO LAST UNTIL SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS PLANS OF WORK AFTER OUR ARRIVAL BROUGHT IN RETURNS MY HOPE WAS TO MEET MY FATHER THERE FOR HE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO TO THE NEW GOLD FIELDS
3235-28433-0003 WHERE HE COULD DO BEACH MINING I WAS NOT ABOVE DOING ANY HONEST WORK AND FELT CONFIDENT THAT I COULD MAKE MY WAY IF I COULD GAIN AN ENTRANCE INTO THAT COUNTRY THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE ALL WORKERS AND I HAD KNOWN THEM FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE
3235-28433-0004 OUR STEAMER WAS THE GOOD SHIP SAINT PAUL BELONGING TO THE ALASKA COMMERCIAL COMPANY AND WAS ADVERTISED TO SAIL ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH
3235-28433-0005 WHEN I LAUGHINGLY CALLED THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF THE OWNERS OF THE SHIP TO THE FACT THAT THAT DATE FELL UPON FRIDAY AND MANY PERSONS OBJECTED TO SAILING UPON THAT DAY HE POSTPONED THE STARTING OF THE SAINT PAUL TO MAY TWENTY SIXTH
3235-28433-0006 AND WE LEFT THE DOCK ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AMID THE CHEERS AND HAND WAVING OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD COME TO SEE THE BIG BOAT OFF FOR NOME THE STEAMER WAS WELL FITTED OUT SPICK AND SPAN IN FRESH CARPETS AND PAINT
3235-28433-0007 AND CROWDED TO THE UTMOST CAPACITY FOR COMFORT EVERY STATEROOM WAS FULL EACH SEAT AT THE TABLES OCCUPIED NOT A FOOT OF SPACE ABOVE OR BELOW DECKS WAS LEFT UNUSED BUT PROVISION WAS MADE FOR ALL
3235-28433-0008 AND THE SHIP WAS WELL MANNED I WAS NOW MUCH GRATIFIED TO LEARN THAT THERE WERE MANY ON BOARD WHOM I HAD MET BEFORE THAT THE STEWARD STEWARDESS AND SEVERAL OF THE WAITERS HAD BEEN ON DUTY ON THE STEAMER BERTHA
3235-28433-0009 DURING MY TRIP OUT FROM ALASKA THE FALL BEFORE WHILE I WAS UPON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE PASSENGERS WITH WHOM I HAD TRAVELED FROM THE SAME PLACE OF PASSENGERS WE HAD ALL TOLD
3235-28433-0010 FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN OF THESE THIRTY FIVE WERE WOMEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHILD ON BOARD AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE BLACK EYED GIRL WITH HER ESKIMO MOTHER AND WHITE FATHER FROM GOLOVIN BAY
3235-28433-0011 WHOM I HAD SEEN AT SAINT MICHAEL SOME MONTHS BEFORE AND WHO WAS NOW GOING BACK TO HER NORTHERN HOME SHE WORE A SAILOR SUIT OF NAVY BLUE SERGE TRIMMED WITH WHITE BRAID AND WAS AS COY AND CUNNING AS EVER
3235-28433-0012 NOT SPEAKING OFTEN TO STRANGERS BUT LAUGHING AND RUNNING AWAY TO HER MOTHER WHEN ADDRESSED FROM THE DAY WE SAILED FROM SAN FRANCISCO UNTIL WE REACHED NOME I MISSED NO MEALS IN THE DINING SALON
3235-28433-0013 A PACE WHICH MY ENGLISH FRIENDS AND OTHERS COULD NOT FOLLOW FOR THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLY ILL IN THE REGION OF THEIR DIGESTIVE APPARATUS FOR SEVERAL DAYS I SLEPT FOR HOURS EACH DAY AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE TRIP
3235-28433-0014 DURING THE NINE DAYS SAIL FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO UNALASKA A DISTANCE OF TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILES I STUDIED WELL THE PASSENGERS WE HAD PREACHERS ON BOARD
3235-28433-0015 AS WELL AS DOCTORS LAWYERS MERCHANTS AND MINERS AND THERE WERE WOMEN GOING TO NOME TO START EATING HOUSES HOTELS AND MERCANTILE SHOPS THERE WERE SEVERAL SWEDISH MISSIONARIES
3235-28433-0016 ONE A ZEALOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO GOING TO THE SWEDISH MISSION AT GOLOVIN BAY THIS YOUNG PERSON WAS PRETTY AND PLEASANT AND I WAS GLAD TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE AS WELL AS THAT OF THREE OTHER WOMEN SPEAKING THE SAME TONGUE
3235-28433-0017 AND OCCUPYING THE NEXT STATEROOM TO MINE THE LAST NAMED WERE GOING TO START A RESTAURANT IN NOME AS THEY WERE SOCIABLE JOLLY AND GOOD SAILORS FOR THE MOST PART I ENJOYED THEIR SOCIETY THEY HAD ALL LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR YEARS
3235-28433-0018 AND THOUGH NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER WERE FIRM FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING AND WERE UNITING THEIR LITTLE FORTUNES IN THE HOPE OF MAKING GREATER ONES THE YOUNG MISSIONARY WAS A FRIEND TO THE OTHER THREE
3235-28433-0019 AND I FOUND NO BETTER OR MORE CONGENIAL COMPANIONS ON BOARD THE SHIP THAN THESE FOUR HONEST HARD WORKING WOMEN SO FULL OF HOPE COURAGE AND GOOD SENSE AS WELL AS CHRISTIANITY
3235-28433-0020 LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE PLACED BY A SEEMING CHANCE IN AN ADJOINING STATEROOM WERE TO BE MY FELLOW WORKERS AND TRUE FRIENDS NOT ONLY FOR THE COMING MONTHS IN THAT ARCTIC LAND TO WHICH WE WERE GOING BUT
3235-28433-0021 AS THE SEQUEL WILL SHOW PERHAPS FOR YEARS TO COME NOT MANY DAYS HAD PASSED WHEN WE FOUND THAT WE HAD ON BOARD WHAT FEW STEAMERS CAN BOAST OF AND THAT WAS AN ORCHESTRA OF PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS AMONG THE WAITERS
3235-28433-0022 THESE WERE MEN GOING WITH ALL THE OTHERS TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES IN THE NEW GOLD FIELDS WORKING THEIR PASSAGE AS WAITERS ON THE SHIP TO NOME WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LEAVE IT THREE EVENINGS IN THE WEEK THESE MUSICIANS
3235-28433-0023 WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL SINGERS ON BOARD GAVE CONCERTS IN THE DINING SALON WHICH THOUGH IMPROMPTU WERE VERY ENJOYABLE A SWEET AND TRAINED SINGER WAS THE ENGLISH GIRL OF OUR COMPANY
3235-28433-0024 AND SHE SANG MANY TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS OF THE MUSICIANS MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED PASSENGERS WHEN SHE SANG ONE EVENING IN HER CLEAR SYMPATHETIC VOICE THE SELECTION
3235-28433-0025 OH WHERE IS MY WANDERING BOY TONIGHT THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE IN THE ROOM AND THE MIND OF MANY A MAN WENT BACK TO HIS OLD HOME AND PRAYING MOTHER IN SOME FAR DISTANT STATE
3235-28433-0026 MAKING HIM RESOLVE TO WRITE OFTENER TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT BE COMFORTED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WHEREABOUTS AND WELFARE THESE EVENINGS WERE SOMETIMES VARIED BY RECITATIONS FROM AN ELOCUTIONIST ON BOARD
3235-28433-0027 AND A PRACTISED CLOG DANCER EXCITED THE RISIBLES OF THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY USUALLY SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER AT HIS EXHIBITION OF FLYING HEELS DAY AFTER DAY PASSED
3235-28433-0028 THOSE WHO WERE CONTINUALLY SEASICK HAD DIVERSION ENOUGH IT WAS USELESS FOR US TO TELL THEM A PATHETIC TALE OF SOME ONE WHO AT SOME TIME HAD BEEN MORE ILL THAN THEY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
3235-28433-0029 AND IT WAS EQUALLY USELESS TO RECOMMEND AN ANTIDOTE FOR MAL DE MER SUCH AS THEIRS NO ONE WAS EVER SO ILL BEFORE THEY SAID THEY KNEW THEY SHOULD DIE AND BE BURIED AT SEA
3235-28433-0030 AND HOPED THEY WOULD IF THAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THEIR SUFFERINGS WE TRIED AT LAST TO GIVE THEM COMFORT BY RECOMMENDING OUT OF FORMER EXPERIENCES SHIP'S BISCUIT DRY TOAST AND POP CORN AS REMEDIES
3235-28433-0031 BUT ONLY RECEIVED BLACK LOOKS AS OUR REWARD WE THEN CONCLUDED THAT A DIET OF TEA COFFEE AND SOUP WAS EXACTLY SUCH A ONE AS THE FISHES WOULD RECOMMEND COULD THEY SPEAK
3235-28433-0032 THESE FAVORITE AND MUCH USED LIQUIDS KEEPING UP A CONTINUAL SWISHING IN ONE'S INTERIOR REGIONS AND CAUSING ONE TO TRUTHFULLY SPEAK OF THE SAME AS INFERNAL INSTEAD OF INTERNAL
3235-28433-0033 BUT THEY WERE ALL TREE PHYSICAL AS WELL AS FREE MORAL AGENTS AND DECIDED THESE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES AT LAST WE ENTERED THE JAPAN CURRENT AND THE WEATHER WAS WARMER AND MORE ENJOYABLE
3235-28433-0034 ON MONDAY JUNE FOURTH WE SAW FROM THE DECK A FEW DRIFTING LOGS AND A QUANTITY OF SEAWEED AND THESE WITH THE PRESENCE OF GULLS AND GOONIES FLYING OVERHEAD CONVINCED US THAT WE WERE NEARING LAND
3235-28433-0035 WE WERE NOT MISTAKEN AFTER EATING AN EXCELLENT SIX O'CLOCK DINNER WE WENT ABOVE TO FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN HIGH ROCKY CLIFFS WHICH LOOMED UP INTO MOUNTAINS NOT FAR DISTANT
3235-28433-0036 AND WE KNEW WE WERE AGAIN AT THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS AND IN THE ROUGH WATERS OF UNIMAK PASS AS WE DREW NEARER AND ENTERED THE HARBOR SO WELL LAND LOCKED THE SUN DIPPED LOW INTO YELLOW RED WESTERN WATERS
3235-28433-0037 THEREBY CASTING LONG SHADOWS ASLANT OUR PATHWAY SO DELICATELY SHADED IN GREENS THE LITTLE HAMLET OF DUTCH HARBOR NESTLED COSILY AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH BORDERED THE BAY
3235-28433-0038 AND HERE NUMBERS OF SHIPS LAY ANCHORED AT REST PASSING ALONG EASILY BEYOND ANOTHER HIGH MOUNTAIN WE WERE SOON AT THE DOCK OF UNALASKA BESIDE OTHER GREAT SHIPS IN PORT
3235-28433-0039 BOTH GROUPS OF CRAFT WERE EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR THE ICE TO CLEAR FROM BEHRING SEA BEFORE PROCEEDING ON THEIR WAY NORTHWARD AND WE COUNTED SIXTEEN SHIPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND SIZES THE MAJORITY OF THEM LARGE STEAMERS
3235-28433-0040 ALL WERE LOADED WITH PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT FOR NOME SCOUT BOATS HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE AND FIND IF POSSIBLE A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ICE FIELDS
3235-28433-0041 AND THE RETURN OF THESE SCOUTS WITH GOOD NEWS WAS ANXIOUSLY WATCHED AND WAITED FOR AS THE MOST DESIRED THING AT THAT TIME WAS A SPEEDY AND SAFE LANDING ON THE SUPPOSEDLY GOLDEN BEACH SANDS OF NOME
3235-28433-0042 AT UNALASKA WE SPENT FOUR DAYS TAKING ON FRESH WATER AND COAL DURING WHICH TIME PASSENGERS VISITED BACK AND FORTH FROM THE WAITING STEAMERS MANY PERSONS HAVING FRIENDS ON OTHER BOATS
3235-28433-0043 AND EACH HAVING A CURIOSITY TO SEE IF THEY WERE FARING AS WELL OR ILL AS HE COMPARING NOTES AS TO THE EXPENSE OF TRAVELING WITH THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES ET CETERA PASSENGERS ON THE SAINT PAUL AGREED THAT THEY HAD NO KICK COMIN
3235-28433-0044 WHICH WAS ONE OF THE COMMONEST SLANG PHRASES INTENDED TO MEAN THAT THEY HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH THE ALASKA COMMERCIAL COMPANY AND THEIR STEAMER SAINT PAUL ALL WERE WELL CARED FOR AND SATISFIED AS WELL THEY MIGHT BE
3235-28433-0045 WITH THE SERVICE OF THE SHIP'S MEN LEAVING UNALASKA THE SUN SHONE CLEAR AND COLD UPON THE MOUNTAINS WHERE IN PLACES THE SIDES LOOKED BLACK FROM THE LATE FIRES STARTED IN THE DEEP TUNDRA BY MISCREANTS
3235-28433-0046 THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH SNOW DOWN DEEP GORGES DASHED MOUNTAIN WATERS OF MELTING SNOW AND ICE HURRYING TO LEAP OFF GULLIED AND ROCKY CLIFFS INTO THE SEA THEIR PROGRESS WAS NEVER IMPEDED
3235-28433-0047 NO TREE NOR SHRUB OBSTRUCTED THE WAY WITH GNARLED OLD TRUNKS TWISTED ROOTS OR LOW HANGING BRANCHES FOR NONE GROW IN UNALASKA
3235-28433-0048 AND THE BOLD DIGNITY AND GRANDEUR OF THE MOUNTAINS IS NEVER DIMINISHED BY THESE LESSER OBJECTS AS OUR SHIP SAILED OUT INTO BEHRING SEA WE WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE STEAMER GEORGE W ELDER WHOSE MASTER
3235-28433-0049 AN OLD FRIEND OF OUR CAPTAIN HAD DECIDED TO FOLLOW IN OUR WAKE HE BEING LESS FAMILIAR THAN THE LATTER WITH ALASKAN WATERS
6147-34607-0000 ABOVE THIS COUPLE THERE WAS ANNE QUEEN OF ENGLAND AN ORDINARY WOMAN WAS QUEEN ANNE SHE WAS GAY KINDLY AUGUST TO A CERTAIN EXTENT NO QUALITY OF HERS ATTAINED TO VIRTUE NONE TO VICE
6147-34607-0001 HER STOUTNESS WAS BLOATED HER FUN HEAVY HER GOOD NATURE STUPID SHE WAS STUBBORN AND WEAK AS A WIFE SHE WAS FAITHLESS AND FAITHFUL HAVING FAVOURITES TO WHOM SHE GAVE UP HER HEART AND A HUSBAND FOR WHOM SHE KEPT HER BED
6147-34607-0002 AS A CHRISTIAN SHE WAS A HERETIC AND A BIGOT SHE HAD ONE BEAUTY
6147-34607-0003 THE REST OF HER PERSON WAS INDIFFERENTLY FORMED SHE WAS A CLUMSY COQUETTE AND A CHASTE ONE HER SKIN WAS WHITE AND FINE SHE DISPLAYED A GREAT DEAL OF IT IT WAS SHE WHO INTRODUCED THE FASHION OF NECKLACES OF LARGE PEARLS CLASPED ROUND THE THROAT
6147-34607-0004 SHE HAD A NARROW FOREHEAD SENSUAL LIPS FLESHY CHEEKS LARGE EYES SHORT SIGHT HER SHORT SIGHT EXTENDED TO HER MIND BEYOND A BURST OF MERRIMENT NOW AND THEN ALMOST AS PONDEROUS AS HER ANGER
6147-34607-0005 SHE LIVED IN A SORT OF TACITURN GRUMBLE AND A GRUMBLING SILENCE WORDS ESCAPED FROM HER WHICH HAD TO BE GUESSED AT SHE WAS A MIXTURE OF A GOOD WOMAN AND A MISCHIEVOUS DEVIL SHE LIKED SURPRISES WHICH IS EXTREMELY WOMAN LIKE ANNE WAS A PATTERN
6147-34607-0006 SHE HAD FITS OF RAGE SHE WAS VIOLENT A BRAWLER NOBODY MORE AWKWARD THAN ANNE IN DIRECTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SHE ALLOWED EVENTS TO FALL ABOUT AS THEY MIGHT CHANCE HER WHOLE POLICY WAS CRACKED
6147-34607-0007 SHE EXCELLED IN BRINGING ABOUT GREAT CATASTROPHES FROM LITTLE CAUSES WHEN A WHIM OF AUTHORITY TOOK HOLD OF HER
6147-34607-0008 SHE DID NOT EXPLAIN HER THOUGHT SHE EXUDED IT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE SPHINX IN THIS GOOSE SHE RATHER LIKED FUN TEASING AND PRACTICAL JOKES COULD SHE HAVE MADE APOLLO A HUNCHBACK IT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HER BUT SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM A GOD
6147-34607-0009 GOOD NATURED HER IDEAL WAS TO ALLOW NONE TO DESPAIR AND TO WORRY ALL SHE HAD OFTEN A ROUGH WORD IN HER MOUTH
6147-34607-0010 WITH WHICH SHE REDDENED HER LIPS AND HAVING COLOURED HER MOUTH WOULD LAUGH SHE WAS GREEDILY FOND OF THE FLAT ZEALAND GINGERBREAD CAKES SHE WAS PROUD OF BEING FAT MORE OF A PURITAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHE WOULD NEVERTHELESS
6147-34607-0011 HAVE LIKED TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO STAGE PLAYS SHE HAD AN ABSURD ACADEMY OF MUSIC COPIED AFTER THAT OF FRANCE IN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED A FRENCHMAN NAMED FORETROCHE WANTED TO BUILD A ROYAL CIRCUS AT PARIS AT A COST OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
6147-34607-0012 THE ASSEMBLY OF TWELVE PERSONS WERE IT ONLY TO EAT OYSTERS AND DRINK PORTER WAS A FELONY UNDER HER REIGN OTHERWISE RELATIVELY MILD PRESSING FOR THE FLEET WAS CARRIED ON WITH EXTREME VIOLENCE A GLOOMY EVIDENCE THAT THE ENGLISHMAN IS A SUBJECT RATHER THAN A CITIZEN
6147-34607-0013 FOR CENTURIES ENGLAND SUFFERED UNDER THAT PROCESS OF TYRANNY WHICH GAVE THE LIE TO ALL THE OLD CHARTERS OF FREEDOM AND OUT OF WHICH FRANCE ESPECIALLY GATHERED A CAUSE OF TRIUMPH AND INDIGNATION WHAT IN SOME DEGREE DIMINISHES THE TRIUMPH IS THAT WHILE SAILORS WERE PRESSED IN ENGLAND
6147-34607-0014 SOLDIERS WERE PRESSED IN FRANCE IN EVERY GREAT TOWN OF FRANCE ANY ABLE BODIED MAN GOING THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS BUSINESS WAS LIABLE TO BE SHOVED BY THE CRIMPS INTO A HOUSE CALLED THE OVEN
6147-34607-0015 THOSE FIT FOR SERVICE WERE PICKED OUT
6147-34607-0016 IN SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE THERE WERE THIRTY OF THESE OVENS IN PARIS THE LAWS AGAINST IRELAND EMANATING FROM QUEEN ANNE WERE ATROCIOUS ANNE WAS BORN IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON ON WHICH THE ASTROLOGERS THERE WERE SOME LEFT
6147-34607-0017 PREDICTED THAT BEING THE ELDER SISTER OF FIRE SHE WOULD BE QUEEN AND SO SHE WAS THANKS TO ASTROLOGY AND THE REVOLUTION OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SHE HAD THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING ONLY GILBERT ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY FOR GODFATHER TO BE GODCHILD OF THE POPE WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IN ENGLAND
6147-34607-0018 A MERE PRIMATE IS BUT A POOR SORT OF GODFATHER ANNE HAD TO PUT UP WITH ONE HOWEVER IT WAS HER OWN FAULT WHY WAS SHE A PROTESTANT DENMARK HAD PAID FOR HER VIRGINITY VIRGINITAS EMPTA AS THE OLD CHARTERS EXPRESSED IT
6147-34607-0019 THERE WAS NEVER A BON MOT BUT IN FRENCH ANNE PAID A DEAL OF ATTENTION TO HER COINS ESPECIALLY TO COPPER COINS WHICH ARE THE LOW AND POPULAR ONES SHE WANTED TO CUT A GREAT FIGURE ON THEM SIX FARTHINGS WERE STRUCK DURING HER REIGN
6147-34607-0020 ON THE BACK OF THE FIRST THREE SHE HAD MERELY A THRONE STRUCK ON THE BACK OF THE FOURTH SHE ORDERED A TRIUMPHAL CHARIOT AND ON THE BACK OF THE SIXTH A GODDESS HOLDING A SWORD IN ONE HAND AND AN OLIVE BRANCH IN THE OTHER WITH THE SCROLL
6147-34607-0021 WHY FRANCE EXCLUDES THEM THERE IS A REASON AT ONCE PERHAPS THERE IS NO OTHER WITH ENGLISH HISTORIANS ELIZABETH EMBODIES GRANDEUR ANNE GOOD NATURE AS THEY WILL BE IT SO BUT THERE IS NOTHING DELICATE IN THE REIGNS OF THESE WOMEN THE LINES ARE HEAVY
6147-34607-0022 THREE ONE IDIOTIC HABIT OF THE PEOPLE IS TO ATTRIBUTE TO THE KING WHAT THEY DO THEMSELVES THEY FIGHT WHOSE THE GLORY THE KING'S THEY PAY WHOSE THE GENEROSITY THE KING'S THEN THE PEOPLE LOVE HIM FOR BEING SO RICH
6147-34607-0023 THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE RESERVED FOR KINGS ALONE IS AN EXCELLENT FIGURE OF ROYALTY THE HORSE IS THE PEOPLE ONLY THAT THE HORSE BECOMES TRANSFIGURED BY DEGREES IT BEGINS IN AN ASS IT ENDS IN A LION
6147-34607-0024 THEN IT THROWS ITS RIDER AND YOU HAVE SIXTEEN FORTY TWO IN ENGLAND AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN FRANCE AND SOMETIMES IT DEVOURS HIM AND YOU HAVE IN ENGLAND SIXTEEN FORTY NINE AND IN FRANCE SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE THAT THE LION SHOULD RELAPSE INTO THE DONKEY IS ASTONISHING BUT IT IS SO
6147-34607-0025 COUNTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN HER FLEET THE ENGLISH HAD THREE ARMIES FIVE THOUSAND MEN IN CATALONIA TEN THOUSAND IN PORTUGAL FIFTY THOUSAND IN FLANDERS
6147-34607-0026 TO MONARCHICAL AND DIPLOMATIC EUROPE A SORT OF PROSTITUTE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE HAS ALWAYS HAD IN KEEPING PARLIAMENT HAVING VOTED A PATRIOTIC LOAN OF THIRTY FOUR MILLION FRANCS OF ANNUITIES THERE HAD BEEN A CRUSH AT THE EXCHEQUER TO SUBSCRIBE IT
6147-34607-0027 AND THAT HE WOULD BE BUT TOO HAPPY IF ENGLAND WOULD ONLY TOLERATE THE KING OF FRANCE FISHING FOR COD AT CAPE BRETON ENGLAND WAS ABOUT TO IMPOSE UPON HIM THE SHAME OF DEMOLISHING HIMSELF THE FORTIFICATIONS OF DUNKIRK MEANWHILE SHE HAD TAKEN GIBRALTAR AND WAS TAKING BARCELONA
6147-34607-0028 WHAT GREAT THINGS ACCOMPLISHED HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO REFUSE ANNE ADMIRATION FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE OF LIVING AT THE PERIOD
6147-34607-0029 BEARS TO HIM THE VAGUE RESEMBLANCE OF A REFLECTION LIKE HIM SHE PLAYS AT A GREAT REIGN SHE HAS HER MONUMENTS HER ARTS HER VICTORIES HER CAPTAINS HER MEN OF LETTERS HER PRIVY PURSE TO PENSION CELEBRITIES HER GALLERY OF CHEFS D'OEUVRE
6147-34607-0030 SIDE BY SIDE WITH THOSE OF HIS MAJESTY HER COURT TOO WAS A CORTEGE WITH THE FEATURES OF A TRIUMPH AN ORDER AND A MARCH IT WAS A MINIATURE COPY OF ALL THE GREAT MEN OF VERSAILLES NOT GIANTS THEMSELVES
6147-34607-0031 IN IT THERE IS ENOUGH TO DECEIVE THE EYE ADD GOD SAVE THE QUEEN WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM LULLI AND THE ENSEMBLE BECOMES AN ILLUSION NOT A PERSONAGE IS MISSING CHRISTOPHER WREN IS A VERY PASSABLE MANSARD SOMERS IS AS GOOD AS LAMOIGNON ANNE HAS A RACINE IN DRYDEN
6147-34607-0032 A LOUVOIS IN PEMBROKE AND A TURENNE IN MARLBOROUGH HEIGHTEN THE WIGS AND LOWER THE FOREHEADS THE WHOLE IS SOLEMN AND POMPOUS AND THE WINDSOR OF THE TIME HAS A FADED RESEMBLANCE TO MARLY STILL THE WHOLE WAS EFFEMINATE AND ANNE'S PERE TELLIER WAS CALLED SARAH JENNINGS
6147-34607-0033 HOWEVER THERE IS AN OUTLINE OF INCIPIENT IRONY WHICH FIFTY YEARS LATER WAS TO TURN TO PHILOSOPHY IN THE LITERATURE OF THE AGE AND THE PROTESTANT TARTUFFE IS UNMASKED BY SWIFT
6147-34607-0034 ALTHOUGH THE ENGLAND OF THE PERIOD QUARRELS AND FIGHTS FRANCE SHE IMITATES HER AND DRAWS ENLIGHTENMENT FROM HER AND THE LIGHT ON THE FACADE OF ENGLAND IS FRENCH LIGHT IT IS A PITY THAT ANNE'S REIGN LASTED BUT TWELVE YEARS OR THE ENGLISH WOULD NOT HESITATE TO CALL IT THE CENTURY OF ANNE
6147-34607-0035 WAS GREATLY ADMIRED IN ENGLAND HE IS THE KIND OF KING THEY WANT IN FRANCE SAID THE ENGLISH THE LOVE OF THE ENGLISH FOR THEIR OWN LIBERTY IS MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN ACCEPTANCE OF SERVITUDE FOR OTHERS THAT FAVOURABLE REGARD OF THE CHAINS WHICH BIND THEIR NEIGHBOURS
6147-34607-0036 NOT FROM CHOICE HOWEVER A PART OF HER RELIGION SHE DERIVED FROM THAT UGLINESS
6147-34607-0037 WAS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO THE QUEEN TO AN UGLY QUEEN A PRETTY DUCHESS IS NOT AN AGREEABLE SISTER THERE WAS ANOTHER GRIEVANCE JOSIANA'S IMPROPER BIRTH ANNE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF ANNE HYDE A SIMPLE GENTLEWOMAN LEGITIMATELY
6147-34607-0038 ANNE HAVING THIS INFERIOR BLOOD IN HER VEINS FELT HERSELF BUT HALF ROYAL AND JOSIANA HAVING COME INTO THE WORLD QUITE IRREGULARLY DREW CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE INCORRECTNESS LESS GREAT BUT REALLY EXISTING IN THE BIRTH OF THE QUEEN
6147-34607-0039 THE DAUGHTER OF MESALLIANCE LOOKED WITHOUT LOVE UPON THE DAUGHTER OF BASTARDY SO NEAR HER IT WAS AN UNPLEASANT RESEMBLANCE JOSIANA HAD A RIGHT TO SAY TO ANNE MY MOTHER WAS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS YOURS AT COURT NO ONE SAID SO BUT THEY EVIDENTLY THOUGHT IT
6147-34607-0040 THIS WAS A BORE FOR HER ROYAL MAJESTY WHY THIS JOSIANA WHAT HAD PUT IT INTO HER HEAD TO BE BORN WHAT GOOD WAS A JOSIANA CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS ARE DETRIMENTAL
6147-34606-0000 JUST AS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR EUGENE DEVERIA WAS THE FIRST TO ALLOW HIS BEARD TO GROW
6147-34606-0001 DISGUISED BY ARTFUL CURLING FOR TO RISK ONE'S HAIR WAS ALMOST TO RISK ONE'S HEAD THE INDIGNATION WAS UNIVERSAL NEVERTHELESS
6147-34606-0002 AND A PEER OF ENGLAND HE WAS INSULTED AND THE DEED WAS WELL WORTH THE INSULT IN THE HOTTEST PART OF THE ROW LORD DAVID SUDDENLY APPEARED WITHOUT HIS WIG AND IN HIS OWN HAIR SUCH CONDUCT SHAKES THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIETY
6147-34606-0003 HE HELD HIS GROUND PRINCE DEVEREUX WAS THE FIRST LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR THE SECOND IT IS SOMETIMES MORE DIFFICULT TO BE SECOND THAN FIRST IT REQUIRES LESS GENIUS BUT MORE COURAGE THE FIRST INTOXICATED BY THE NOVELTY MAY IGNORE THE DANGER
6147-34606-0004 MEN FOUND SUFFICIENT AUDACITY TO WEAR THEIR OWN HAIR AND POWDER WAS INTRODUCED AS AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH BEFORE WE PASS ON AN IMPORTANT PERIOD OF HISTORY WE SHOULD REMARK THAT THE FIRST BLOW IN THE WAR OF WIGS WAS REALLY STRUCK BY A QUEEN
6147-34606-0005 SUCH GREAT THINGS MADE HIM A MARK FOR PUBLIC ADMIRATION THERE WAS NOT A CLUB OF WHICH HE WAS NOT THE LEADER NOT A BOXING MATCH IN WHICH HE WAS NOT DESIRED AS REFEREE THE REFEREE IS THE ARBITRATOR HE HAD DRAWN UP THE RULES OF SEVERAL CLUBS IN HIGH LIFE
6147-34606-0006 THE LOWEST STAKE ALLOWED WAS A ROULEAU OF FIFTY GUINEAS AND THERE WAS NEVER LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND GUINEAS ON THE TABLE BY THE SIDE OF EACH PLAYER WAS A LITTLE STAND ON WHICH TO PLACE HIS CUP OF TEA AND A GILT BOWL IN WHICH TO PUT THE ROULEAUX OF GUINEAS THE PLAYERS LIKE SERVANTS WHEN CLEANING KNIVES
6147-34606-0007 WORE LEATHER SLEEVES TO SAVE THEIR LACE BREASTPLATES OF LEATHER TO PROTECT THEIR RUFFLES
6147-34606-0008 THOUGH HANDSOME HE BELONGED TO THE UGLY CLUB THIS CLUB WAS DEDICATED TO DEFORMITY THE MEMBERS AGREED TO FIGHT NOT ABOUT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN BUT ABOUT AN UGLY MAN THE HALL OF THE CLUB WAS ADORNED BY HIDEOUS PORTRAITS
6147-34606-0009 TRIBOULET DUNS HUDIBRAS SCARRON OVER THE CHIMNEY WAS A ESOP BETWEEN TWO MEN EACH BLIND OF AN EYE
6147-34606-0010 COCLES BEING BLIND OF THE LEFT CAMOENS OF THE RIGHT EYE SO ARRANGED THAT THE TWO PROFILES WITHOUT EYES WERE TURNED TO EACH OTHER THE DAY THAT THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS VISART CAUGHT THE SMALL POX THE UGLY CLUB TOASTED HER THIS CLUB WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
6147-34606-0011 AND MIRABEAU WAS ELECTED AN HONORARY MEMBER
6147-34606-0012 THERE WAS THE FUN CLUB FUN IS LIKE CANT LIKE HUMOUR A WORD WHICH IS UNTRANSLATABLE FUN IS TO FARCE WHAT PEPPER IS TO SALT TO GET INTO A HOUSE AND BREAK A VALUABLE MIRROR SLASH THE FAMILY PORTRAITS POISON THE DOG
6147-34606-0013 TO GIVE BAD NEWS WHICH IS UNTRUE WHEREBY PEOPLE PUT ON MOURNING BY MISTAKE IS FUN IT WAS FUN TO CUT A SQUARE HOLE IN THE HOLBEIN AT HAMPTON COURT
6147-34606-0014 A YOUNG MILLIONAIRE LORD WHO HAD DURING THE NIGHT SET FIRE TO A THATCHED COTTAGE A FEAT WHICH MADE ALL LONDON BURST WITH LAUGHTER WAS PROCLAIMED THE KING OF FUN THE POOR DEVILS IN THE COTTAGE WERE SAVED IN THEIR NIGHT CLOTHES THE MEMBERS OF THE FUN CLUB ALL OF THE HIGHEST ARISTOCRACY
6147-34606-0015 USED TO RUN ABOUT LONDON DURING THE HOURS WHEN THE CITIZENS WERE ASLEEP PULLING THE HINGES FROM THE SHUTTERS CUTTING OFF THE PIPES OF PUMPS FILLING UP CISTERNS DIGGING UP CULTIVATED PLOTS OF GROUND PUTTING OUT LAMPS SAWING THROUGH THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED HOUSES
6147-34606-0016 IT WAS THE RICH WHO ACTED THUS TOWARDS THE POOR FOR THIS REASON NO COMPLAINT WAS POSSIBLE THAT WAS THE BEST OF THE JOKE THOSE MANNERS HAVE NOT ALTOGETHER DISAPPEARED IN MANY PLACES IN ENGLAND AND IN ENGLISH POSSESSIONS AT GUERNSEY FOR INSTANCE
6147-34606-0017 TO INJURE TO FULFIL THIS DUTY ALL MEANS WERE HELD GOOD IN BECOMING A MOHAWK THE MEMBERS TOOK AN OATH TO BE HURTFUL TO INJURE AT ANY PRICE NO MATTER WHEN NO MATTER WHOM NO MATTER WHERE WAS A MATTER OF DUTY
6147-34606-0018 THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND HIM CHASTISED HIM FOR THIS BY A PRICK OF HIS SWORD WHICH MADE HIM SPRING ROUND ANOTHER PRICK IN THE BACK WARNED THE FELLOW THAT ONE OF NOBLE BLOOD WAS BEHIND HIM AND SO ON EACH ONE WOUNDING HIM IN HIS TURN WHEN THE MAN CLOSED ROUND BY THE CIRCLE OF SWORDS AND COVERED WITH BLOOD
6147-34606-0019 HAD TURNED AND DANCED ABOUT ENOUGH THEY ORDERED THEIR SERVANTS TO BEAT HIM WITH STICKS TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HIS IDEAS OTHERS HIT THE LION THAT IS THEY GAILY STOPPED A PASSENGER
6147-34606-0020 IF HIS EYES WERE GOUGED OUT HE WAS PAID FOR THEM SUCH WERE TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE PASTIMES OF THE RICH IDLERS OF LONDON THE IDLERS OF PARIS HAD THEIRS
6147-34606-0021 JUST LIKE ANY ONE ELSE HE WOULD GAILY SET FIRE TO A COT OF WOODWORK AND THATCH AND JUST SCORCH THOSE WITHIN BUT HE WOULD REBUILD THEIR HOUSES IN STONE HE INSULTED TWO LADIES ONE WAS UNMARRIED HE GAVE HER A PORTION THE OTHER WAS MARRIED HE HAD HER HUSBAND APPOINTED CHAPLAIN
6147-34606-0022 AND ALL THOSE ON THE NECK SO MUCH LESS FOR THE ENEMY'S BEAK HE USED TO SAY THEN HE EXTENDED THE COCK'S WINGS AND CUT EACH FEATHER ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO A POINT AND THUS THE WINGS WERE FURNISHED WITH DARTS SO MUCH FOR THE ENEMY'S EYES HE WOULD SAY
6147-34606-0023 THEN HE SCRAPED ITS CLAWS WITH A PENKNIFE SHARPENED ITS NAILS FITTED IT WITH SPURS OF SHARP STEEL SPAT ON ITS HEAD SPAT ON ITS NECK ANOINTED IT WITH SPITTLE AS THEY USED TO RUB OIL OVER ATHLETES THEN SET IT DOWN IN THE PIT A REDOUBTABLE CHAMPION EXCLAIMING
6147-34606-0024 THAT'S HOW TO MAKE A COCK AN EAGLE AND A BIRD OF THE POULTRY YARD A BIRD OF THE MOUNTAIN LORD DAVID ATTENDED PRIZE FIGHTS AND WAS THEIR LIVING LAW ON OCCASIONS OF GREAT PERFORMANCES
6147-34606-0025 AND FROM HIS OWN MOUTH FILLED WITH WATER BLOWING A FINE RAIN INTO HIS EYES AND EARS A THING WHICH REANIMATES EVEN A DYING MAN IF HE WAS REFEREE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO FOUL PLAY PREVENTED ANY ONE WHOSOEVER HE MIGHT BE FROM ASSISTING THE COMBATANTS EXCEPTING THE SECONDS
6147-34606-0026 DECLARE THE MAN BEATEN WHO DID NOT FAIRLY FACE HIS OPPONENT WATCHED THAT THE TIME BETWEEN THE ROUNDS DID NOT EXCEED HALF A MINUTE PREVENTED BUTTING
6147-34606-0027 AND FORBADE A MAN'S BEING HIT WHEN DOWN ALL THIS SCIENCE HOWEVER DID NOT RENDER HIM A PEDANT NOR DESTROY HIS EASE OF MANNER IN SOCIETY WHEN HE WAS REFEREE ROUGH PIMPLE FACED UNSHORN FRIENDS OF EITHER COMBATANT NEVER DARED TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAILING MAN
6147-34606-0028 LORD DAVID WAS ONE OF THE FEW REFEREES WHOM THEY DARED NOT THRASH NO ONE COULD TRAIN LIKE HIM THE PUGILIST WHOSE TRAINER HE CONSENTED TO BECOME WAS SURE TO WIN LORD DAVID WOULD CHOOSE A HERCULES MASSIVE AS A ROCK TALL AS A TOWER AND MAKE HIM HIS CHILD
6147-34606-0029 THE PROBLEM WAS TO TURN THAT HUMAN ROCK FROM A DEFENSIVE TO AN OFFENSIVE STATE IN THIS HE EXCELLED HAVING ONCE ADOPTED THE CYCLOPS HE NEVER LEFT HIM HE BECAME HIS NURSE HE MEASURED OUT HIS WINE WEIGHED HIS MEAT AND COUNTED HIS HOURS OF SLEEP
6147-34606-0030 IT WAS HE WHO INVENTED THE ATHLETE'S ADMIRABLE RULES
6147-34606-0031 AFTER WHICH HE UNDRESSED HIS MAN RUBBED HIM AND PUT HIM TO BED IN THE STREET HE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO LEAVE HIS SIGHT KEEPING HIM OUT OF EVERY DANGER RUNAWAY HORSES THE WHEELS OF CARRIAGES DRUNKEN SOLDIERS PRETTY GIRLS HE WATCHED OVER HIS VIRTUE
6147-34606-0032 THIS MATERNAL SOLICITUDE CONTINUALLY BROUGHT SOME NEW PERFECTION INTO THE PUPIL'S EDUCATION HE TAUGHT HIM THE BLOW WITH THE FIST WHICH BREAKS THE TEETH AND THE TWIST OF THE THUMB WHICH GOUGES OUT THE EYE WHAT COULD BE MORE TOUCHING THUS HE WAS PREPARING HIMSELF FOR PUBLIC LIFE TO WHICH HE WAS TO BE CALLED LATER ON
6147-34606-0033 IT IS NO EASY MATTER TO BECOME AN ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF OPEN AIR EXHIBITIONS OF SHOWS OF CIRCUSES WITH WILD BEASTS OF THE CARAVANS OF MOUNTEBANKS OF CLOWNS TUMBLERS MERRYMEN OPEN AIR FARCES AND THE WONDERS OF A FAIR
6147-34606-0034 THE TRUE NOBLE IS HE WHO SMACKS OF THE PEOPLE THEREFORE IT WAS THAT LORD DAVID FREQUENTED THE TAVERNS AND LOW HAUNTS OF LONDON AND THE CINQUE PORTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE AT NEED AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS RANK IN THE WHITE SQUADRON TO BE CHEEK BY JOWL WITH A TOPMAN OR A CALKER
8088-284756-0000 FROM SOMEWHERE OUT ON THE BLACK HEAVING ATLANTIC THE RAPID MUFFLED POPPING OF A SPEED BOAT'S EXHAUST DRIFTED CLEARLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
8088-284756-0001 THERE WAS REAL ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE RUM RUNNERS SEEKING OUT THEIR HIDDEN PORT WITH THEIR CARGO OF CONTRABAND FROM CUBA HEADING FEARLESSLY THROUGH THE DARKNESS FIGHTING THE HIGH SEAS STILL RUNNING AFTER THE STORM OF A DAY OR SO BEFORE
8088-284756-0002 DARING A THOUSAND DANGERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE STRAW PACKED BOTTLES THEY CARRIED SEA BRONZED MEN WITH HARD FLAT MUSCLES AND FEARLESS EYES READY GUNS SLAPPING THEIR THIGHS AS THEY
8088-284756-0003 ABSORBED IN MY MENTAL PICTURE OF THESE MODERN FREE BOOTERS THE SUDDEN ALARM OF THE TELEPHONE STARTLED ME LIKE AN UNEXPECTED SHOT FIRED BESIDE MY EAR BRUSHING THE CIGARETTE ASHES FROM MY SMOKING JACKET I CROSSED THE ROOM AND SNATCHED UP THE RECEIVER
8088-284756-0004 HELLO I SNAPPED UNGRACIOUSLY INTO THE MOUTHPIECE IT WAS AFTER ELEVEN BY THE SHIP'S CLOCK ON THE MANTEL AND IF TAYLOR THE VOICE WARREN MERCER'S FAMILIAR VOICE
8088-284756-0005 GET IN YOUR CAR AND COME DOWN HERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE COME JUST AS YOU ARE AND WHAT'S THE MATTER I MANAGED TO INTERRUPT HIM BURGLARS
8088-284756-0006 I HAD NEVER HEARD MERCER SPEAK IN THAT HIGH PITCHED EXCITED VOICE BEFORE HIS USUAL SPEECH WAS SLOW AND THOUGHTFUL ALMOST DIDACTIC
8088-284756-0007 IF IT WEREN'T URGENT I WOULDN'T BE CALLING YOU YOU KNOW WILL YOU COME YOU BET I SAID QUICKLY FEELING RATHER A FOOL FOR RAGGING HIM WHEN HE WAS IN SUCH DEADLY EARNEST HAVE THE RECEIVER SNAPPED AND CRACKLED
8088-284756-0008 USUALLY THE VERY SOUL OF COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION
8088-284756-0009 A MOMENT LATER I WAS OFF THE GRAVELLED DRIVE AND TEARING DOWN THE CONCRETE WITH THE ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THE BLACK WIND SHRIEKING AROUND THE WINDSHIELD OF MY LITTLE ROADSTER MY OWN SHACK WAS OUT OF THE CITY LIMITS
8088-284756-0010 MERCER PICKED THE PLACE UP FOR ME AT A SONG THE MONSTROSITY WAS SOME FOUR MILES FURTHER OUT FROM TOWN AND OFF THE HIGHWAY PERHAPS A HALF MILE MORE
8088-284756-0011 I MADE THE FOUR MILES IN JUST A SHADE OVER THAT MANY MINUTES AND CLAMPED ON THE BRAKES AS I SAW THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE DRIVE THAT LED TOWARD THE SEA AND MERCER'S ESTATE
8088-284756-0012 WITH GRAVEL RATTLING ON MY FENDERS I TURNED OFF THE CONCRETE AND SWEPT BETWEEN THE TWO MASSIVE STUCCOED PILLARS THAT GUARDED THE DRIVE BOTH OF THEM BORE CORRODED BRONZE PLATES THE BILLOWS THE NAME GIVEN THE MONSTROSITY BY THE ORIGINAL OWNER
8088-284756-0013 A NEWLY RICH MUNITIONS MANUFACTURER THE STRUCTURE ITSELF LOOMED UP BEFORE ME IN A FEW SECONDS A RAMBLING AFFAIR WITH SQUARE SHOULDERED BALCONIES AND A GREAT DEAL OF WROUGHT IRON WORK AFTER THE MOST FLAMBOYANT SPANISH PATTERN IT WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT
8088-284756-0014 APPARENTLY EVERY BULB IN THE PLACE WAS BURNING JUST A FEW YARDS BEYOND THE SURF BOOMED HOLLOWLY ON THE SMOOTH SHADY SHORE LITTERED NOW I KNEW BY THE PITIFUL SPOILS OF THE STORM
8088-284756-0015 AS I CLAMPED ON MY BRAKES A SWIFT SHADOW PASSED TWO OF THE LOWER WINDOWS BEFORE I COULD LEAP FROM THE CAR THE BROAD FRONT DOOR WITH ITS ROUNDED TOP AND CIRCULAR GRILLED WINDOW WAS FLUNG WIDE AND MERCER CAME RUNNING TO MEET ME
8088-284756-0016 HE WAS WEARING A BATHROBE HASTILY FLUNG ON OVER A DAMP BATHING SUIT HIS BARE LEGS TERMINATING IN A PAIR OF DISREPUTABLE SLIPPERS FINE TAYLOR HE GREETED ME I SUPPOSE YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I DON'T BLAME YOU BUT COME IN COME IN

8088-284756-0018 MERCER HE LAUGHED EXCITEDLY YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL SEE NO I'M NOT IN LOVE AND I WANT YOU TO HELP AND NOT ADMIRE THERE ARE ONLY CARSON AND MYSELF HERE YOU KNOW AND THE JOB'S TOO BIG FOR THE TWO OF US
8088-284756-0019 HE HURRIED ME ACROSS THE BROAD CONCRETE PORCH AND INTO THE HOUSE THROW THE CAP ANYWHERE AND COME ON TOO MUCH AMAZED TO COMMENT FURTHER I FOLLOWED MY FRIEND THIS WAS A WARREN MERCER I DID NOT KNOW
8088-284756-0020 HIS EYES DARK AND LARGE SMILED EASILY AND SHONE WITH INTEREST BUT HIS ALMOST BEAUTIFUL MOUTH BENEATH THE LONG SLIM MUSTACHE ALWAYS CLOSELY CROPPED SELDOM SMILED WITH HIS EYES BUT IT WAS HIS PRESENT EXCITED SPEECH THAT AMAZED ME MOST
8088-284756-0021 MERCER DURING ALL THE YEARS I HAD KNOWN HIM HAD NEVER BEEN MOVED BEFORE TO SUCH TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURSTS OF ENTHUSIASM IT WAS HIS HABIT TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY IN HIS LOW MUSICAL VOICE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOTTEST ARGUMENTS AND WE HAD HAD MANY OF THEM
8088-284756-0022 THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS NEARLY ALL GLASS AND OPENED ONTO THE PATIO AND THE SWIMMING POOL MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR A STRANGE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES NOW YOU'LL SEE WHY I CALLED YOU HERE HE SAID TENSELY
8088-284756-0023 YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER THE TRIP WAS WORTH WHILE HERE SHE IS WITH A GESTURE HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND I STARED FOLLOWING HIS GLANCE DOWN AT THE GREAT TILED SWIMMING POOL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE
8088-284756-0024 THE PATIO WAS NOT LARGE BUT IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE FLOWERS AND SHRUBS EVEN A FEW SMALL PALMS GREW IN PROFUSION IN THE ENCLOSURE WHILE ABOVE THROUGH THE MOVABLE GLASS ROOF MADE IN SECTIONS TO DISAPPEAR IN FINE WEATHER
8088-284756-0025 WAS THE EMPTY BLACKNESS OF THE SKY NONE OF THE LIGHTS PROVIDED FOR THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COVERED PATIO WAS TURNED ON BUT ALL THE WINDOWS SURROUNDING THE PATIO WERE AGLOW AND I COULD SEE THE POOL QUITE CLEARLY THE POOL AND ITS OCCUPANT
8088-284756-0026 WE WERE STANDING AT ONE SIDE OF THE POOL NEAR THE CENTER DIRECTLY OPPOSITE US SEATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL WAS A HUMAN FIGURE NUDE SAVE FOR A GREAT MASS OF TAWNY HAIR THAT FELL ABOUT HER LIKE A SILKEN MANTLE
8088-284756-0027 EVEN IN THE SOFT LIGHT I COULD SEE HER PERFECTLY THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER HER PALE BODY OUTLINED SHARPLY AGAINST THE JADE GREEN TILES I TORE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE STARING CURIOUS EYES OF THE FIGURE IN GOD'S NAME MERCER WHAT IS IT
8088-284756-0028 PORCELAIN I ASKED HOARSELY THE THING HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY EERY EFFECT HE LAUGHED WILDLY PORCELAIN WATCH LOOK MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS POINTING FINGER
8088-284756-0029 THE GREAT CLOUD OF CORN COLORED HAIR FLOATED DOWN ABOUT IT FALLING BELOW THE KNEES SLOWLY WITH A GRACE OF MOVEMENT COMPARABLE ONLY WITH THE SLOW SOARING OF A GULL SHE CAME TOWARD ME WALKING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER AS THOUGH SHE FLOATED IN AIR
8088-284756-0030 FASCINATED I WATCHED HER HER EYES STARTLINGLY LARGE AND DARK IN THE STRANGELY WHITE FACE WERE FIXED ON MINE THERE WAS NOTHING SINISTER IN THE GAZE YET I FELT MY BODY SHAKING AS THOUGH IN THE GRIP OF A TERRIBLE FEAR
8088-284756-0031 I TRIED TO LOOK AWAY AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO MOVE I FELT MERCER'S TENSE SUDDEN GRIP UPON MY ARM BUT I DID NOT COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM SHE SHE'S SMILING I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
8088-284756-0032 HE LAUGHED AN EXCITED HIGH PITCHED LAUGH THAT IRRITATED ME IN SOME SUBTLE WAY SHE WAS SMILING AND LOOKING UP INTO MY EYES SHE WAS VERY CLOSE NOW WITHIN A FEW FEET OF US
8088-284756-0033 AND HER BOSOM RISING AND FALLING BENEATH THE VEIL OF PALE GOLD HAIR SHE WAS BREATHING WATER MERCER LITERALLY JERKED ME AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0034 HE ASKED HIS DARK EYES DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT TELL ME ABOUT IT I SAID SHAKING MY HEAD DAZEDLY SHE IS NOT HUMAN I DON'T KNOW I THINK SO AS HUMAN AS YOU OR I I'LL TELL YOU ALL I KNOW AND THEN YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
8088-284756-0035 I THINK WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES IF MY PLANS WORK OUT BUT FIRST SLIP ON A BATHING SUIT I DIDN'T ARGUE THE MATTER I LET MERCER LEAD ME AWAY WITHOUT A WORD AND WHILE I WAS CHANGING HE TOLD ME ALL HE KNEW OF THE STRANGE CREATURE IN THE POOL
8088-284756-0036 LATE THIS AFTERNOON I DECIDED TO GO FOR A LITTLE WALK ALONG THE BEACH MERCER BEGAN I HAD BEEN WORKING LIKE THE DEVIL SINCE EARLY IN THE MORNING RUNNING SOME TESTS ON WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH I FELT THE NEED OF SOME FRESH SEA AIR
8088-284756-0037 I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
8088-284756-0038 THE SHORE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WASHED UP BY THE BIG STORM AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MAN WITH A TRUCK COME AND CLEAN UP THE SHORE IN FRONT OF THE PLACE WHEN IN A LITTLE SANDY POOL I SAW HER
8088-284756-0039 SHE WAS LAYING FACE DOWN IN THE WATER MOTIONLESS HER HEAD TOWARDS THE SEA ONE ARM STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER AND HER LONG HAIR WRAPPED AROUND HER LIKE A HALF TRANSPARENT CLOAK I RAN UP AND LIFTED HER FROM THE WATER HER BODY WAS COLD AND DEATHLY WHITE
8088-284756-0040 AND TOOK THE LIQUOR IN A SINGLE DRAUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO DRINK IT BUT SUCKED IT OUT OF THE GLASS IN A SINGLE AMAZING GULP THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR IT
8088-284756-0041 WEBBED I ASKED STARTLED WEBBED NODDED MERCER SOLEMNLY AS ARE HER FEET BUT LISTEN TAYLOR I WAS AMAZED AND NOT A LITTLE RATTLED WHEN SHE CAME FOR ME
8088-284756-0042 I RAN THROUGH THE FRENCH WINDOWS OUT INTO THE PATIO FOR A MOMENT SHE RAN AFTER ME RATHER AWKWARDLY AND HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY NEVERTHELESS THEN SHE SAW THE POOL APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT I EXISTED SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER
8088-284756-0043 I REMINDED HIM AS HE PAUSED APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT I TRIED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER I PUT ON MY BATHING SUIT AND DIVED INTO THE POOL WELL SHE CAME AT ME LIKE A SHARK QUICK AS A FLASH HER TEETH SHOWING HER HANDS TEARING LIKE CLAWS THROUGH THE WATER
8088-284756-0044 SHE MANAGED TO CLAW ME JUST ONCE MERCER RESUMED WRAPPING THE ROBE ABOUT HIM AGAIN THEN I GOT OUT AND CALLED ON CARSON FOR HELP I PUT HIM INTO A BATHING SUIT AND WE BOTH ENDEAVORED TO CORNER HER
8088-284756-0045 CARSON GOT TWO BAD SCRATCHES AND ONE RATHER SERIOUS BITE THAT I HAVE BANDAGED I HAVE A NUMBER OF LACERATIONS BUT I DIDN'T FARE SO BADLY AS CARSON BECAUSE I AM FASTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS THE HARDER WE TRIED THE MORE DETERMINED I BECAME
8088-284756-0046 WE MOVED OUT OF THE ROOM NOTHING HUMAN CAN LIVE UNDER WATER AND BREATHE WATER AS SHE DOES MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT STARING AT ME ODDLY THE HUMAN RACE HE SAID GRAVELY CAME UP OUT OF SEA THE HUMAN RACE AS WE KNOW IT SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK
8088-284756-0047 MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN
8088-284756-0048 AND IN THAT WHITE BATHING SUIT YES I BELIEVE SHE'S TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU MERCER'S EYES WERE DANCING IF SHE HAS HE WENT ON IT'LL MAKE OUR WORK VERY EASY WHAT WORK I ASKED SUSPICIOUSLY
8088-284756-0049 I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
8088-284756-0050 I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
8088-284756-0051 I ASKED EAGERLY GLANCING DOWN AT THE BEAUTIFUL PALE FACE THAT GLIMMERED UP AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER OF THE POOL WHY TRY IT ON HER EXCLAIMED MERCER WITH MOUNTING ENTHUSIASM DON'T YOU SEE TAYLOR
8088-284756-0052 IF IT WILL WORK ON HER AND WE CAN DIRECT HER THOUGHTS WE CAN FIND OUT HER HISTORY THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE WE'LL ADD A PAGE TO SCIENTIFIC HISTORY A WHOLE BIG CHAPTER THAT WILL MAKE US FAMOUS MAN THIS IS SO BIG IT'S SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET
8088-284756-0053 LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY
8088-284756-0054 LET'S GET BUSY WHAT CAN I DO MERCER REACHED AROUND THE DOOR INTO THE LABORATORY AND PRESSED A BUTTON FOR CARSON HE EXPLAINED WE'LL NEED HIS HELP IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL LOOK OVER THE SET UP THE APPARATUS IS STREWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
8088-284756-0055 HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE SET UP CONSISTED OF A WHOLE BANK OF TUBES EACH ONE IN ITS OWN SHIELDING COPPER BOX ON A MUCH DRILLED HORIZONTAL PANEL PROPPED UP ON INSULATORS WERE HALF A SCORE OF DELICATE METERS OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
8088-284756-0056 WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
8088-284756-0057 AND IN THE CENTER A SWITCH WITH FOUR CONTACT POINTS A HEAVY SNAKY CABLE LED FROM THIS PANEL TO THE MAZE OF APPARATUS FURTHER ON THIS IS THE CONTROL PANEL EXPLAINED MERCER THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU UNDERSTAND IS IN LABORATORY FORM
8088-284756-0058 NOTHING ASSEMBLED PUT THE DIFFERENT ANTENNAE PLUG INTO THESE JACKS LIKE THIS HE PICKED UP A WEIRD HASTILY BUILT CONTRIVANCE COMPOSED OF TWO SEMI CIRCULAR PIECES OF SPRING BRASS CROSSED AT RIGHT ANGLES
8088-284756-0059 ON ALL FOUR ENDS WERE BRIGHT SILVERY ELECTRODES THREE OF THEM CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ONE OF THEM ELONGATED AND SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH A QUICK NERVOUS GESTURE MERCER FITTED THE THING TO HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0060 SO THAT THE ELONGATED ELECTRODE PRESSED AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS NECK EXTENDING A FEW INCHES DOWN HIS SPINE THE OTHER THREE CIRCULAR ELECTRODES RESTED ON HIS FOREHEAD AND EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0061 SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
8088-284756-0062 HE ADJUSTED A SECOND CONTRIVANCE UPON MY HEAD SMILING AS I SHRANK FROM THE CONTACT OF THE COLD METAL ON MY SKIN AND THINK HE MOVED THE SWITCH FROM THE POSITION MARKED OFF TO THE SECOND CONTACT POINT WATCHING ME INTENTLY HIS DARK EYES GLEAMING
8088-284756-0063 VERY NICE OLD CHAP CARSON IMPRESSIVE EVEN IN HIS BATHING SUIT MERCER WAS MIGHTY LUCKY TO HAVE A MAN LIKE CARSON SOMETHING SEEMED TO TICK SUDDENLY SOMEWHERE DEEP IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS YES THAT'S VERY TRUE
8088-284756-0064 THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
8088-284756-0065 I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
8088-284756-0066 IF WE CAN GET HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE REPLIED MERCER CONFIDENTLY I HAVE ONLY THREE OF THEM I HAD PLANNED SOME THREE CORNERED EXPERIMENTS WITH YOU CARSON AND MYSELF WE'LL LEAVE CARSON OUT OF TO NIGHT'S EXPERIMENT HOWEVER FOR WE'LL NEED HIM TO OPERATE THIS SWITCH
8088-284756-0067 THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
8088-284756-0068 I'LL LENGTHEN THESE LEADS SO THAT WE CAN RUN THEM OUT INTO THE POOL AND THEN WE'LL BE READY SOMEHOW WE MUST INDUCE HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS EVEN IF WE HAVE TO USE FORCE I'M SURE THE THREE OF US CAN HANDLE HER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO I SMILED
8088-284756-0069 SHE WAS SUCH A SLIM GRACEFUL ALMOST DELICATE LITTLE THING THE THOUGHT THAT THREE STRONG MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL HER SEEMED ALMOST AMUSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ACTION YET SAID MERCER GRIMLY
8088-284756-0070 THEN WITH ALL THREE OF THE DEVICES HE CALLED ANTENNAE IN HIS HAND THEIR LEADS PLUGGED INTO THE CONTROL PANEL HE LED THE WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0071 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HER MOVE IN THIS FASHION SHE SEEMED TO PROPEL HERSELF WITH A SUDDEN MIGHTY THRUST OF HER FEET AGAINST THE BOTTOM SHE DARTED THROUGH THE WATER WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW YET STOPPED AS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD MERELY FLOATED THERE
8088-284756-0072 AS SHE LOOKED UP HER EYES UNMISTAKABLY SOUGHT MINE AND HER SMILE SEEMED WARM AND INVITING SHE MADE AGAIN THAT STRANGE LITTLE GESTURE OF INVITATION WITH AN EFFORT I GLANCED AT MERCER
8088-284756-0073 THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
8088-284756-0074 I HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE HEAVY BRONZE LADDER THAT LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I HAD TWO REASONS IN MIND I WOULD NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ME UNDER WATER WITH MY LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND I COULD GET OUT QUICKLY IF IT WERE NECESSARY
8088-284756-0075 I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE LIVID JAGGED FURROWS IN MERCER'S SIDE QUICKLY AS I SHOT TO THE LADDER SHE WAS THERE BEFORE ME A DIM WAVERING WHITE SHAPE WAITING I PAUSED HOLDING TO A RUNG OF THE LADDER WITH ONE HAND
8088-284756-0076 SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
8088-284756-0077 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0078 THE SOUND CEASED SUDDENLY ON A RISING NOTE AS THOUGH OF INQUIRY AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I HAD HEARD THE SPEECH OF THIS STRANGE CREATURE BEFORE I COULD THINK OF A COURSE OF ACTION MY ACHING LUNGS REMINDED ME OF THE NEED OF AIR
8088-284756-0079 AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
8088-284756-0080 I LOOKED DOWN THE GIRL WAS WATCHING ME AND THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HER FACE NOW
8088-284756-0081 AS HER FACE CAME CLOSE TO MY OWN I BECAME AWARE OF THE HUMMING CROONING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE LOUDER THIS TIME
8088-284756-0082 I SMILED BACK AT HER AND SHOOK MY HEAD
8088-284756-0083 I POINTED UPWARD FOR I WAS FEELING THE NEED FOR FRESH AIR AGAIN AND SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LADDER THIS TIME SHE DID NOT GRASP ME BUT WATCHED ME INTENTLY AS THOUGH UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID AND THE REASONS FOR IT
8088-284756-0084 BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
8088-284756-0085 THE SALT WATER WOULD SHORT THE ANTENNAE YOU SEE TRY TO GET HER TO WEAR ONE AND THEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF WATER AND DON YOURS AND REMEMBER SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BY WORDS WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER TO CONVEY HER THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF MENTAL PICTURES
8088-284756-0086 I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
8088-284756-0087 TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GET HER THOUGHTS TO ME THEN I HELD UP THE ANTENNAE AND PLACED IT ON MY OWN HEAD TO SHOW THAT IT COULD NOT HARM HER MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO OFFER HER THE INSTRUMENT MOVING SLOWLY AND SMILING REASSURINGLY
8088-284756-0088 NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
8088-284756-0089 I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
8088-284756-0090 I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
8088-284756-0091 SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
8088-284756-0092 I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
8088-284756-0093 I VISUALIZED THEM JUST AS I COULD CLOSE MY EYES AND VISUALIZE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY OWN HOME I LOOKED DOWN AT THE GIRL SHE WAS FROWNING AND HER EYES WERE VERY WIDE
8088-284756-0094 HER HEAD WAS A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE WHO LISTENS INTENTLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY MERCER THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE POOL THEN I SAW AGAIN THE BEACH
8088-284756-0095 I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
8088-284756-0096 AND I SENSED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE INSTRUMENT I WORE THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF ME I SAW MY OWN FEATURES IDEALIZED GLOWING WITH A STRANGE BEAUTY THAT WAS CERTAINLY NONE OF MY OWN I REALIZED THAT I SAW MYSELF IN SHORT AS SHE SAW ME
8088-284756-0097 A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
8088-284756-0098 THE STRUCTURES VARIED GREATLY IN SIZE AND SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED IN SOME SORT OF REGULAR ORDER LIKE HOUSES ALONG A NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0099 AROUND MANY OF THEM GREW CLUSTERS OF STRANGE AND COLORFUL SEAWEEDS THAT WAVED THEIR BANNERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SOME IMPERCEPTIBLE CURRENT DALLIED WITH THEM IN PASSING HERE AND THERE FIGURES MOVED SLIM WHITE FIGURES THAT STROLLED ALONG THE NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0100 OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
8088-284756-0101 AND THERE WAS A REMARKABLE UNIFORMITY OF SIZE AND APPEARANCE NONE OF THE STRANGE BEINGS WORE GARMENTS OF ANY KIND NOR WERE THEY NECESSARY
8088-284756-0102 THE CLINGING TRESSES WERE CINCTURED AT THE WAIST WITH A SORT OF CORD OF TWISTED ORANGE COLORED MATERIAL AND SOME OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WORE BANDS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AROUND THEIR BROWS NEAREST OF ALL THE FIGURES WAS THE GIRL WHO WAS VISUALIZING ALL THIS FOR US
8088-284756-0103 SHE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF CORAL STRUCTURES ONCE OR TWICE SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE BUT EACH TIME SHE MOVED ON THE CORAL STRUCTURES GREW SMALLER AND POORER
8088-284756-0104 FINALLY THE GIRL TROD ALONE ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN BETWEEN GREAT GROWTHS OF KELP AND SEAWEEDS WITH DIM LOOMING MASSES OF FAINTLY TINTED CORAL EVERYWHERE ONCE SHE PASSED CLOSE TO A TILTED RAGGED HULK OF SOME ANCIENT VESSEL
8088-284756-0105 ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
8088-284756-0106 BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
8088-284756-0107 THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
8088-284756-0108 AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
8088-284756-0109 THE GIRL WAS THINKING OF HER SUFFERING TAKEN OUT OF HER NATIVE ELEMENT
8088-284756-0110 THAT NO DOUBT WAS WHY SHE HATED HIM
8088-284756-0111 ADJUSTED TO HER OWN IDEAS OF WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE I FLUNG THE INSTRUMENT FROM MY HEAD AND DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I GRIPPED BOTH HER SHOULDERS GENTLY TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND FRIENDSHIP MY HEART WAS POUNDING
8088-284756-0112 THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
8088-284756-0113 HER GREAT WEIRDLY BLUE EYES SEEMED TO BORE INTO MY BRAIN I COULD FEEL THEM THROBBING THERE I FORGOT TIME AND SPACE I SAW ONLY THAT PALE SMILING FACE AND THOSE GREAT DARK EYES
8088-284756-0114 THEN STRANGLING I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE AND SHOT TO THE SURFACE COUGHING I CLEARED MY LUNGS OF THE WATER I HAD INHALED I WAS WEAK AND SHAKING WHEN I FINISHED BUT MY HEAD WAS CLEAR THE GRIP OF THE STRANGE FANTASY THAT HAD GRIPPED ME WAS SHAKEN OFF
8088-284756-0115 MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
8088-284756-0116 BUT THERE IS NO RETRACING THE WAY I NODDED MY HEAD BOWED ON MY STREAMING CHEST SORRY MERCER I MUTTERED SOMETHING GOT INTO ME THOSE BIG EYES OF HERS SEEMED TO TUG AT THREADS OF MEMORY BURIED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
8088-284756-0117 IT HELPED JERK ME BACK TO THE NORMAL YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AGAIN TAYLOR HE COMMENTED SOOTHINGLY I THINK THERE'S NO DANGER OF YOU LOSING YOUR GRIP ON TERRA FIRMA AGAIN SHALL WE CARRY ON THERE'S MORE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN THAT YOU THINK SHE CAN GIVE US
8088-284756-0118 I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
8088-284756-0119 WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
4813-248641-0000 MANY OF THE CARS ARE MODERATELY PRICED AFFAIRS THE TONNEAU WELL FILLED WITH CHILDREN OF MISCELLANEOUS AGES AND ENLIVENED BY A FAMILY DOG OR TWO FOR THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SPENDS ITS MODERN SABBATH HOLIDAY
4813-248641-0001 FOR A ROAD ORIGINALLY MARKED BY THE MOCCASINED FEET OF INDIANS AND WIDENED GRADUALLY BY THE TOILSOME JOURNEYINGS OF ROUGH COLONIAL CARTS AND COACHES
4813-248641-0002 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHICH FEATURE OF THE STEADILY MOVING TRAVEL WOULD MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE ORIGINAL PURITAN SETTLERS OF THE TOWN THE FACT THAT EVEN THE COMMON MAN THE POOR MAN COULD OWN SUCH A VEHICLE OF SPEED AND EASE OR THE FACT THAT AMERICA
4813-248641-0003 SUCH A SHORT TIME AGO A WILDERNESS COULD PRODUCE NOT AS THE FINEST FLOWER ON ITS TREE OF EVOLUTION BUT CERTAINLY AS ITS MOST EXOTIC THE PLUTOCRAT WHO LIVES IN A PALACE WITH FIFTY SERVANTS TO DO HIS BIDDING
4813-248641-0004 AND THE FINE LADY WHOSE SOLE EXERCISE OF HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS CONSISTS IN ALLOWING HER MAID TO DRESS HER YES NEW ENGLAND HAS CHANGED AMAZINGLY IN THE REVOLUTIONS OF THREE CENTURIES
4813-248641-0005 AND HERE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THIS SQUARE PLAIN BUILDING HINGHAM'S OLD SHIP CHURCH WHILE WE PAUSE TO WATCH THE SUNDAY PAGEANT OF NINETEEN TWENTY WE CAN MOST EASILY CALL BACK THE SABBATH RITES AND THE IDEALS WHICH CREATED THOSE RITES
4813-248641-0006 THIS WOODEN MEETING HOUSE WITH THE TRUNCATED PYRAMIDAL ROOF AND BELFRY TO SERVE AS A LOOKOUT STATION HAS JUST BEEN BUILT A STAGE AHEAD ARCHITECTURALLY OF THE LOG MEETING HOUSE WITH CLAY FILLED CHINKS THATCHED ROOF OILED PAPER WINDOWS
4813-248641-0007 EARTHEN FLOOR AND A STAGE BEHIND THE CHARMING STEEPLE STYLE MADE POPULAR BY SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN AND NOW MULTIPLIED IN COUNTLESS GRACEFUL EXAMPLES ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND
4813-248641-0008 THE OLD SHIP IS ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS AWAITING IT THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE OLDEST HOUSE FOR PUBLIC WORSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH STILL STANDS ON ITS ORIGINAL SITE AND WHICH IS STILL USED FOR ITS ORIGINAL PURPOSE
4813-248641-0009 IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE IT IS MERELY THE NEW MEETING HOUSE OF THE LITTLE HAMLET OF HINGHAM THE PEOPLE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEIR NEW BUILDING THE TIMBERS HAVE BEEN HEWN WITH THE BROAD AXE OUT OF SOLID WHITE PINE
4813-248641-0010 THE MARKS ARE STILL VISIBLE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF OPEN TO THE ATTIC THE BELFRY IS PRECISELY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOUR SIDED PITCHED ROOF TO BE SURE THIS NECESSITATES RINGING THE BELL FROM ONE OF THE PEWS
4813-248641-0011 BUT A LITTLE LATER THE BELLRINGER WILL STAND ABOVE AND THROUGH A PANE OF GLASS LET INTO THE CEILING HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THE MINISTER ENTERS THE PULPIT THE ORIGINAL BACKLESS BENCHES WERE REPLACED BY BOX PEWS WITH NARROW SEATS LIKE SHELVES
4813-248641-0012 NO PAINT NO DECORATIONS NO COLORED WINDOWS NO ORGAN OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST THE COLOR THE BEAUTY THE FORMALISM OF THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND
4813-248641-0013 SINCE IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE GENERAL COURT DECREED THAT NO DWELLING
4813-248641-0014 OF ANY NEW PLANTATION THUS ELIMINATING THE EXCUSE OF TOO GREAT DISTANCE EVERY ONE IS EXPECTED NAY COMMANDED TO COME TO CHURCH IN FACT AFTER THE TOLLING OF THE LAST BELL THE HOUSES MAY ALL BE SEARCHED
4813-248641-0015 EACH TEN FAMILIES IS UNDER AN INSPECTOR IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF DELINQUENTS HIDING IN THEM AND SO IN TWOS AND THREES OFTEN THE MAN TRUDGING AHEAD WITH HIS GUN AND THE WOMAN CARRYING HER BABY WHILE THE SMALLER CHILDREN CLING TO HER SKIRTS
4813-248641-0016 SOMETIMES MAN AND WOMAN AND A CHILD OR TWO ON HORSEBACK NO MATTER HOW WILD THE STORM HOW SWOLLEN THE STREAMS HOW DEEP THE WHIRLING SNOW THEY ALL COME TO CHURCH
4813-248641-0017 THE CONGREGATION EITHER WAITS FOR THE MINISTER AND HIS WIFE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OR STANDS UNTIL HE HAS ENTERED THE PULPIT ONCE INSIDE THEY ARE SEATED WITH THE MOST METICULOUS EXACTNESS ACCORDING TO RANK AGE SEX AND WEALTH
4813-248641-0018 AND THE SLAVES AND INDIANS ARE IN THE REAR TO SEAT ONE'S SELF IN THE WRONG PUE IS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE HERE IS THE CHURCH AND HERE ARE THE PEOPLE AS THE OLD RHYME HAS IT WHAT THEN OF THE SERVICES
4813-248641-0019 THAT THEY ARE INTERMINABLE WE KNOW THE TITHING MAN OR CLERK MAY TURN THE BRASS BOUND HOURGLASS BY THE SIDE OF THE PULPIT TWO AND THREE TIMES DURING THE SERMON AND ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE PRAYER INTERMINABLE
4813-248641-0020 THE OLD SHIP WAS NOT HEATED UNTIL EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO THE ONLY RELIEF FROM THE CHILL AND STIFFNESS COMES DURING THE PRAYER WHEN THE CONGREGATION STANDS KNEELING OF COURSE WOULD SAVOR TOO STRONGLY OF IDOLATRY AND THE CHURCH OF ROME
4813-248641-0021 THEY STAND TOO WHILE THE PSALMS AND HYMNS ARE LINED OUT AND AS THEY SING THEM VERY UNCERTAINLY AND VERY INCORRECTLY THIS PERFORMANCE ALONE SOMETIMES TAKES AN HOUR AS THERE IS NO ORGAN NOR NOTES
4813-248641-0022 AND ONLY A FEW COPIES OF THE BAY PSALM BOOK OF WHICH BY THE WAY A COPY NOW WOULD BE WORTH MANY TIMES ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD AFTER THE MORNING SERVICE THERE IS A NOON INTERMISSION IN WHICH THE HALF FROZEN CONGREGATION STIRS AROUND
4813-248641-0023 ONE SOMETIMES WONDERS HOW THE LITTLE THINGS HAD ANY IMPULSE TO LAUGH IN SUCH AN ABYSMAL ATMOSPHERE BUT APPARENTLY THE PURITAN BOYS AND GIRLS WERE ENTIRELY NORMAL AND EVEN WHOLESOMELY MISCHIEVOUS AS PROVED BY THE CONSTANTLY REQUIRED SERVICES OF THE TITHING MAN
4813-248641-0024 THESE EXTERNAL TRAPPINGS OF THE SERVICE SOUND DEPRESSING ENOUGH BUT IF THE MESSAGE RECEIVED WITHIN THESE CHILLY WALLS IS CHEERING MAYBE WE CAN FORGET OR IGNORE THE PHYSICAL DISCOMFORTS BUT IS THE MESSAGE CHEERING HELL DAMNATION ETERNAL TORTURES
4813-248641-0025 PAINFUL THEOLOGICAL HAIR SPLITTINGS HARROWING SELF EXAMINATIONS AND HUMILIATING PUBLIC CONFESSIONS THIS IS WHAT THEY GATHER ON THE NARROW WOODEN BENCHES TO LISTEN TO HOUR AFTER HOUR SEARCHING THEIR SOULS FOR SIN WITH AN ALMOST FRENZIED EAGERNESS
4813-248641-0026 APPEALING TO THE EMOTIONS QUITE AS VIVIDLY ALTHOUGH THROUGH A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS THE MOST ELABORATE CEREMONIAL WHEN THE SOUL IS WROUGHT TO A CERTAIN PITCH EACH HARDSHIP IS MERELY AN ADDED OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE ITS FAITH
4813-248641-0027 FROM THE MOTHER CHURCH AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND FORTIFY THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE IN A NEW LAND IT WAS RELIGIOUS ZEAL WHICH FURNISHED THIS MOTIVE POWER DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTS AND DIFFERENTLY DIRECTED FORCE ARE NEEDED TO EXTRACT THE DIAMOND FROM THE EARTH
4813-248641-0028 HAVING DONE ITS WORK HAVING FOUNDED SOUNDLY AND PEOPLED STRONGLY AN EXCEPTIONAL REGION THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE HAD NO FURTHER NECESSITY FOR BEING THOSE WHOM IT NOW TORTURES WITH ITS HOT PINCERS OF DOUBT AND SELF REPROACH
4813-248641-0029 ARE SACRIFICED TO A CAUSE LONG SINCE WON THE PURITANS THEMSELVES GREW AWAY FROM MANY OF THEIR EXCESSIVE SEVERITIES BUT AS THEY GAINED BODILY STRENGTH FROM THEIR CONFLICT WITH THE ELEMENTS SO THEY GAINED A CERTAIN MORAL STAMINA
4813-248641-0030 BY THEIR SELF IMPOSED RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE AND THIS MORAL STAMINA HAS MARKED NEW ENGLAND EVER SINCE AND MARKED HER TO HER GLORY ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM CHURCHES INDEED ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM
4813-248641-0031 WITHOUT ADMIRING MENTION OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH THIS BUILDING OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS AND FINISH WITHIN AND WITHOUT BUILT BY BULFINCH IN EIGHTEEN O SIX IS ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESS EXAMPLES OF ITS TYPE ON THE SOUTH SHORE
4813-248641-0032 YOU WILL APPRECIATE THE CREAM COLORED PAINT THE BUFF WALLS THE QUAINT BOX PEWS OF OILED WOOD WITH HANDRAILS GLEAMING FROM THE TOUCH OF MANY GENERATIONS WITH WOODEN BUTTONS AND PROTRUDING HINGES PROCLAIMING AN ANCIENT FASHION
4813-248641-0033 BUT THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH IS ITS SLAVE GALLERIES THESE TWO SMALL GALLERIES BETWEEN THE ROOF AND THE CHOIR LOFT HELD FOR THIRTY YEARS IN DIMINISHING NUMBERS NEGROES AND INDIANS
4813-248641-0034 THE LAST OCCUPANT WAS A BLACK LUCRETIA WHO AFTER BEING FREED WAS INVITED TO SIT DOWNSTAIRS WITH HER MASTER AND MISTRESS WHICH SHE DID AND WHICH SHE CONTINUED TO DO UNTIL HER DEATH NOT SO VERY LONG AGO
4813-248641-0035 HINGHAM ITS MAIN STREET ALAS FOR THE ORIGINAL NAME OF BACHELORS ROWE ARCHED BY A DOUBLE ROW OF SUPERB ELMS ON EITHER SIDE IS INCALCULABLY RICH IN OLD HOUSES OLD TRADITIONS OLD FAMILIES
4813-248641-0036 EVEN MOTORING THROUGH TOO QUICKLY AS MOTORISTS MUST ONE CANNOT HELP BEING STRUCK BY THE SUBSTANTIAL DIGNITY OF THE PLACE BY THE WELL KEPT PROSPERITY OF THE HOUSES LARGE AND SMALL WHICH FRINGE THE FINE OLD HIGHWAY
4813-248641-0037 THE TOWN HAS PRESERVED A CRANFORD LIKE CHARM AND WHY NOT WHEN THE VERY HOUSE IS STILL HANDSOMELY PRESERVED WHERE THE NAMELESS NOBLEMAN FRANCIS LE BARON WAS CONCEALED BETWEEN THE FLOORS
4813-248641-0038 AND AS WE ARE TOLD IN MISSUS AUSTEN'S NOVEL VERY PROPERLY CAPPED THE CLIMAX BY MARRYING HIS BRAVE LITTLE PROTECTOR MOLLY WILDER WHY NOT WHEN THE LINCOLN FAMILY ANCESTORS OF ABRAHAM
4813-248641-0039 NAMED AFTER THE INDIAN CHIEF WHO GRANTED THE ORIGINAL DEEDS OF THE TOWN HAS FOUND QUARTERS IN AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING HOUSE DATING FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY IN THE SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM ARE SEVENTEEN PANELS ON THE WALLS AND IN THE DOORS
4813-248641-0040 PAINTED WITH CHARMING OLD FASHIONED SKILL BY JOHN HAZLITT THE BROTHER OF THE ENGLISH ESSAYIST THE REVEREND DANIEL SHUTE HOUSE BUILT IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IS PRACTICALLY INTACT WITH ITS PANELED ROOMS
4813-248641-0041 AND WALL PAPER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD HINGHAM'S FAMOUS ELMS SHADE THE HOUSE WHERE PARSON EBENEZER GAY LIVED OUT HIS LONG PASTORATE OF SIXTY NINE YEARS AND NINE MONTHS AND THE GARRISON HOUSE BUILT BEFORE SIXTEEN FORTY
4813-248641-0042 SHELTERED IN ITS PRIME NINE GENERATIONS OF THE SAME FAMILY THE RAINBOW ROOF HOUSE SO CALLED FROM THE DELICIOUS CURVE IN ITS ROOF IS ONE OF HINGHAM'S PRETTIEST TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD COTTAGES AND MISS SUSAN B WILLARD'S COTTAGE
4813-248641-0043 IS ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE UNITED STATES DERBY ACADEMY FOUNDED ALMOST TWO CENTURIES AND A HALF AGO BY MADAM DERBY STILL MAINTAINS ITS SOCIAL AND SCHOLARLY PRESTIGE THROUGH ALL THE EDUCATIONAL TURMOIL OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
4813-248641-0044 THAT JOHN ALBION ANDREW WHO PROVED HIMSELF SO TRULY ONE OF OUR GREAT MEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR COURTED ELIZA JONES HERSEY AND HERE THAT THE HAPPY YEARS OF THEIR EARLY MARRIED LIFE WERE SPENT
4813-248641-0045 LATER ANOTHER GOVERNOR JOHN D LONG WAS FOR MANY YEARS A MIGHTY FIGURE IN THE TOWN WITH ITS ANCIENT CHURCHES AND INSTITUTIONS ITS PENSIVE GRAVEYARDS AND LOVELY ELMS
4813-248641-0046 HINGHAM TYPIFIES WHAT IS QUAINTEST AND BEST IN NEW ENGLAND TOWNS POSSIBLY THE DAPPLING OF THE ELMS POSSIBLY THE SHADOW OF THE OLD SHIP CHURCH
4813-248641-0047 HOWEVER IT MAY SEEM TO ITS INHABITANTS TO THE STRANGER EVERYTHING IN HINGHAM IS TINCTURED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE STERN OLD ECCLESIASTICISM EVEN THE NUMBER OF HISTORIC FORTS SEEMS A PROPER PART OF THOSE RIGHTEOUS DAYS
4813-248641-0048 FOR WHEN DID RELIGION AND WARFARE NOT GO HAND IN HAND DURING THE TROUBLE WITH KING PHILIP THE TOWN HAD THREE FORTS ONE AT FORT HILL ONE AT THE CEMETERY AND ONE ON THE PLAIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE HARBOR AND THE SITES MAY STILL BE IDENTIFIED
4813-248641-0049 WERE LANDED ON THEIR SALTY DECKS FOR FIFTY YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE RAPID SAILED AS A PACKET BETWEEN THIS TOWN AND BOSTON MAKING THE TRIP ON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION IN SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES
4813-248641-0050 SHE WAS CARRIED UP THE WEYMOUTH RIVER AND COVERED MASTS AND HULL WITH GREEN BUSHES SO THAT THE MARAUDING BRITISH CRUISERS MIGHT NOT FIND HER AND AS WE READ WE FIND OURSELVES REMEMBERING THAT CAMOUFLAGE IS NEW ONLY IN NAME
4813-248641-0051 OR WOULD THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR SOWING HAD BROUGHT FORTH RICHER FRUIT THAN THEY COULD GUESS IT HAS ALL CHANGED SINCE PURITAN DAYS AND YET PERHAPS IN NO OTHER PLACE IN NEW ENGLAND DOES THE HAND OF THE PAST LIE SO VISIBLY UPON THE COMMUNITY
4813-248641-0052 YOU CANNOT LIFT YOUR EYES BUT THEY REST UPON SOME BUILDING RAISED TWO CENTURIES AND MORE AGO THE SHADE WHICH RIPPLES UNDER YOUR FEET IS CAST BY ELMS PLANTED BY THAT VERY HAND OF THE PAST EVEN YOUR VOICE REPEATS THE WORDS WHICH THOSE OLD PATRIARCHS
4813-248641-0053 WELL VERSED IN BIBLICAL LORE CHOSE FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD NAMES ACCORD POND AND GLAD TIDINGS PLAIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIFTED FROM SOME PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WHILE THE NEAR BY SEA OF GALILEE AND JERUSALEM ROAD
4813-248641-0054 ARE FROM THE GOOD BOOK ITSELF WHICH WAY TO EGYPT IS THIS AN ECHO FROM THAT TIME WHEN THE BIBLE WAS THE CORNER STONE OF CHURCH AND STATE OF HOME AND SCHOOL WHAT'S THE BEST ROAD TO JERICHO BEACH SURELY IT IS SOME GRAVE FACED SHADE WHO CALLS
3857-182315-0000 HOW I HATE THE MAN WHO TALKS ABOUT THE BRUTE CREATION WITH AN UGLY EMPHASIS ON BRUTE AS FOR ME I AM PROUD OF MY CLOSE KINSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
3857-182315-0001 I TAKE A JEALOUS PRIDE IN MY SIMIAN ANCESTRY I LIKE TO THINK THAT I WAS ONCE A MAGNIFICENT HAIRY FELLOW LIVING IN THE TREES AND THAT MY FRAME HAS COME DOWN THROUGH GEOLOGICAL TIME VIA SEA JELLY AND WORMS
3857-182315-0002 AND AMPHIOXUS FISH DINOSAURS AND APES WHO WOULD EXCHANGE THESE FOR THE PALLID COUPLE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN W N P BARBELLION
3857-182315-0003 LAST SUNDAY POTTER TOOK ME OUT DRIVING ALONG UPPER BROADWAY WHERE THOSE LONG ROWS OF TALL NEW APARTMENT HOUSES WERE BUILT A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS A MILD AFTERNOON AND GREAT CROWDS OF PEOPLE WERE OUT
3857-182315-0004 SUNDAY AFTERNOON CROWDS THEY WERE NOT GOING ANYWHERE THEY WERE JUST STROLLING UP AND DOWN STARING AT EACH OTHER AND TALKING THERE WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM
3857-182315-0005 I TURNED AND ASKED WHY WHAT ABOUT THEM I WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE HAD AN IDEA OR A HEADACHE OTHER CREATURES DON'T DO IT HE REPLIED WITH A DISCOURAGED EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0006 ARE ANY OTHER BEINGS EVER FOUND IN SUCH MASSES BUT VERMIN AIMLESS STARING VACANT MINDED LOOK AT THEM
3857-182315-0007 I CAN GET NO SENSE WHATEVER OF INDIVIDUAL WORTH OR OF VALUE IN MEN AS A RACE WHEN I SEE THEM LIKE THIS IT MAKES ONE ALMOST DESPAIR OF CIVILIZATION I THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR AWHILE
3857-182315-0008 AND YET AT OTHER TIMES I TOO FEEL LIKE A SPECTATOR AN ALIEN BUT EVEN THEN I HAD NEVER FELT SO ALIEN OR DESPAIRING AS POTTER LET'S REMEMBER I SAID IT'S A SIMIAN CIVILIZATION
3857-182315-0009 POTTER WAS STARING DISGUSTEDLY AT SOME VAUDEVILLE SIGN BOARDS YES I SAID THOSE FOR EXAMPLE ARE DISTINCTIVELY SIMIAN WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOMETHING INEVITABLE AND I WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT IT WASN'T AS THOUGH WE WERE DESCENDED FROM
3857-182315-0010 EAGLES FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BROADLY SPEAKING FROM APE LIKE OR MONKEYISH BEINGS BEING OF SIMIAN STOCK WE HAD SIMIAN TRAITS OUR DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY BORE THE MARKS OF OUR ORIGIN
3857-182315-0011 WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT TWO IF WE HAD BEEN MADE DIRECTLY FROM CLAY THE WAY IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE AND HAD THEREFORE INHERITED NO INTERMEDIATE CHARACTERISTICS
3857-182315-0012 IF A GOD OR SOME PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH HAD GONE THAT WAY TO WORK WITH US HE OR IT MIGHT HAVE MOLDED US IN MUCH MORE SPLENDID FORMS BUT CONSIDERING OUR SIMIAN DESCENT IT HAS DONE VERY WELL
3857-182315-0013 THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DISAPPOINTED IN US ARE THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVE THAT CLAY STORY OR WHO UNCONSCIOUSLY STILL LET IT COLOR THEIR THINKING THERE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE A POWER AT WORK IN THE WORLD
3857-182315-0014 BY VIRTUE OF WHICH EVERY LIVING THING GROWS AND DEVELOPS AND IT TENDS TOWARD SPLENDOR SEEDS BECOME TREES AND WEAK LITTLE NATIONS GROW GREAT BUT THE PUSH OR THE FORCE THAT IS DOING THIS THE YEAST AS IT WERE
3857-182315-0015 HAS TO WORK IN AND ON CERTAIN DEFINITE KINDS OF MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS YEAST IS IN US THERE MAY BE GREAT AND UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES AWAITING MANKIND BUT BECAUSE OF OUR LINE OF DESCENT
3857-182315-0016 THERE ARE ALSO QUEER LIMITATIONS THREE IN THOSE DISTANT INVISIBLE EPOCHS BEFORE MEN EXISTED BEFORE EVEN THE PROUD MISSING LINK STRUTTED AROUND THROUGH THE WOODS
3857-182315-0017 LITTLE REALIZING HOW WE HIS GREATGRANDSONS WOULD SMILE WRYLY AT HIM MUCH AS OUR OWN DESCENDANTS MAY SHUDDER AT US AGES HENCE THE VARIOUS ANIMALS WERE DESPERATELY COMPETING FOR POWER THEY COULDN'T OR DIDN'T LIVE AS EQUALS
3857-182315-0018 CERTAIN GROUPS SOUGHT THE HEADSHIP MANY STRANGE FORGOTTEN DYNASTIES ROSE MET DEFIANCE AND FELL IN THE END IT WAS OUR ANCESTORS WHO WON AND BECAME SIMIAN KINGS AND BEQUEATHED A WHOLE PLANET TO US
3857-182315-0019 AND KEPT US IN CAGES OR SHOW US FOR SPORT IN THE FOREST WHILE THEY RULED THE WORLD SO POTTER AND I DEVELOPING THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT BEGAN TO IMAGINE WE HAD LIVED MANY AGES AGO AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAD ALIGHTED HERE FROM SOME OLDER PLANET
3857-182315-0020 FAMILIAR WITH THE WAYS OF EVOLUTION ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE WE NATURALLY SHOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT COURSE IT WOULD TAKE ON THIS EARTH EVEN IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE COSMOS WE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED AND ON THIS TINY STAR
3857-182315-0021 IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO CONSIDER THE TREND OF EVENTS WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO APPRAISE THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AS THEY WANDERED AROUND EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF GOOD AND BAD CHARACTERISTICS WHICH GROUP WE'D HAVE WONDERED WOULD EVER CONTRIVE TO RULE ALL THE REST
3857-182315-0022 AND HOW GREAT A DEVELOPMENT COULD THEY ATTAIN TO THEREAFTER
3857-182315-0023 WE MIGHT FIRST HAVE CONSIDERED THE LEMURS OR APES THEY HAD HANDS AESTHETICALLY VIEWED THE POOR SIMIANS WERE SIMPLY GROTESQUE BUT TRAVELERS WHO KNEW OTHER PLANETS MIGHT HAVE KNOWN WHAT BEAUTY MAY SPRING FROM AN UNCOUTH BEGINNING IN THIS MAGIC UNIVERSE
3857-182315-0024 STILL THOSE FROWSY UNLOVELY HORDES OF APES AND MONKEYS WERE SO COMPLETELY LACKING IN SIGNS OF KINGSHIP THEY WERE SO FLIGHTY TOO IN THEIR WAYS AND HAD SO LITTLE PURPOSE AND SO MUCH LOVE FOR ABSURD AND IDLE CHATTER
3857-182315-0025 THEY ARE NOT EASILY LEFT BEHIND EVEN AFTER LONG STAGES AND THEY FORM A TERRIBLE OBSTACLE TO ALL HIGH ADVANCEMENT
3857-182315-0026 THE BEES OR THE ANTS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO US MORE PROMISING THEIR SMALLNESS OF SIZE WAS NOT NECESSARILY TOO MUCH OF A HANDICAP THEY COULD HAVE MADE POISON THEIR WEAPON FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF RIVALS
3857-182315-0027 AND IN THESE ORDERLY INSECTS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A CAPACITY FOR LABOR AND CO OPERATIVE LABOR AT THAT WHICH COULD CARRY THEM FAR WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A MARKED GENIUS GREAT GIFTS OF THEIR OWN
3857-182315-0028 IN A CIVILIZATION OF SUPER ANTS OR BEES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEM OF THE HUNGRY UNEMPLOYED NO POVERTY NO UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT NO RIOTS NO STRIKES FOR SHORT HOURS
3857-182315-0029 NO DERISION OF EUGENICS NO THIEVES PERHAPS NO CRIME AT ALL ANTS ARE GOOD CITIZENS THEY PLACE GROUP INTERESTS FIRST BUT THEY CARRY IT SO FAR THEY HAVE FEW OR NO POLITICAL RIGHTS
3857-182315-0030 AN ANT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTE APPARENTLY HE JUST HAS HIS DUTIES THIS QUALITY MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HAVING GROUPS WARS THE EGOTISM OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPIRITS IS ALLOWED SCANT EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0031 SO THE EGOTISM OF THE GROUPS IS EXTREMELY FEROCIOUS AND ACTIVE IS THIS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ANTS FIGHT SO MUCH WE HAVE SEEN THE SAME PHENOMENON OCCUR IN CERTAIN NATIONS OF MEN AND THE ANTS COMMIT ATROCITIES IN AND AFTER THEIR BATTLES THAT ARE
3857-182315-0032 I WISH I COULD TRULY SAY INHUMAN BUT CONVERSELY ANTS ARE ABSOLUTELY UNSELFISH WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE SKILFUL INGENIOUS THEIR NESTS AND BUILDINGS ARE RELATIVELY LARGER THAN MAN'S
3857-182315-0033 THE SCIENTISTS SPEAK OF THEIR PAVED STREETS VAULTED HALLS THEIR HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS THEIR PLUCK AND INTELLIGENCE THEIR INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE THEIR CHASTE AND INDUSTRIOUS LIVES
3857-182315-0034 DARWIN SAID THE ANT'S BRAIN WAS ONE OF THE MOST MARVELOUS ATOMS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS MORE SO THAN THE BRAIN OF MAN YES OF PRESENT DAY MAN WHO FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAS HAD SO MUCH MORE CHANCE TO DEVELOP HIS BRAIN
3857-182315-0035 A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE WEIGHED ALL THESE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHEN WE THINK OF THESE CREATURES AS LITTLE MEN WHICH IS ALL WRONG OF COURSE WE SEE THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS TO OUR EYES THEY SEEM TOO ORDERLY FOR INSTANCE
3857-182315-0036 REPRESSIVELY SO THEIR WAYS ARE MORE FIXED THAN THOSE OF THE OLD EGYPTIANS AND THEIR INDUSTRY IS PAINFUL TO THINK OF IT'S HYPER CHINESE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THIS IS A SIMIAN COMMENT
3857-182315-0037 THE INSTINCTS OF THE SPECIES THAT YOU AND I BELONG TO ARE OF AN OPPOSITE KIND AND THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR US TO JUDGE ANTS FAIRLY BUT WE AND THE ANTS ARE ALIKE IN ONE MATTER THE STRONG LOVE OF PROPERTY
3857-182315-0038 AND INSTEAD OF MERELY STRUGGLING WITH NATURE FOR IT THEY ALSO FIGHT OTHER ANTS THE CUSTOM OF PLUNDER SEEMS TO BE A PART OF MOST OF THEIR WARS THIS HAS GONE ON FOR AGES AMONG THEM AND CONTINUES TODAY
3857-182315-0039 RAIDS FEROCIOUS COMBATS AND LOOT ARE PART OF AN ANT'S REGULAR LIFE ANT REFORMERS IF THERE WERE ANY MIGHT LAY THIS TO THEIR PROPERTY SENSE AND TALK OF ABOLISHING PROPERTY AS A CURE FOR THE EVIL
3857-182315-0040 BUT THAT WOULD NOT HELP FOR LONG UNLESS THEY COULD ABOLISH THE LOVE OF IT ANTS SEEM TO CARE EVEN MORE FOR PROPERTY THAN WE DO OURSELVES WE MEN ARE INCLINED TO EASE UP A LITTLE WHEN WE HAVE ALL WE NEED
3857-182315-0041 THEY CAN'T BEAR TO STOP THEY KEEP RIGHT ON WORKING THIS MEANS THAT ANTS DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THEY HEED NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN LITTLE ROUNDS IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THEIR FONDNESS FOR LABOR HAD CLOSED FAST THEIR MINDS
3857-182315-0042 CONCEIVABLY THEY MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED INQUIRING MINDS BUT THIS WOULD HAVE RUN AGAINST THEIR STRONGEST INSTINCTS THE ANT IS KNOWING AND WISE BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO TAKE A VACATION
3857-182315-0043 WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE THEREWITH TO RULE THEIR INSTINCTS OR TO STOP WORK LONG ENOUGH TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES OR THE UNIVERSE OR TO DREAM OF ANY NOBLE DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY NOT REASON IS SELDOM OR NEVER THE RULER
3857-182315-0044 IT IS THE SERVANT OF INSTINCT IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TOLD THE ANTS THAT INCESSANT TOIL WAS USEFUL AND GOOD TOIL HAS BROUGHT YOU UP FROM THE RUCK OF THINGS REASON WOULD HAVE PLAUSIBLY SAID
3857-182315-0045 IT'S BY VIRTUE OF FEVERISH TOIL THAT YOU HAVE BECOME WHAT YOU ARE BEING ENDLESSLY INDUSTRIOUS IS THE BEST ROAD FOR YOU TO THE HEIGHTS
3857-182317-0000 SOME HAD OVER TRUSTFUL CHARACTERS LIKE THE SEALS OR EXPLOITABLE CHARACTERS LIKE COWS AND CHICKENS AND SHEEP SUCH CREATURES SENTENCE THEMSELVES TO BE CAPTIVES BY THEIR LACK OF AMBITION DOGS THEY HAVE MORE SPIRIT
3857-182317-0001 BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE OF KINGSHIP THROUGH WORSHIPPING US THE DOG'S FINER QUALITIES CAN'T BE PRAISED TOO WARMLY THERE IS A PURITY ABOUT HIS DEVOTION WHICH MAKES MERE MEN FEEL SPEECHLESS BUT WITH ALL LOVE FOR DOGS
3857-182317-0002 ONE MUST GRANT THEY ARE VASSALS NOT RULERS THEY ARE TOO PARASITIC THE ONE WILLING SERVANT CLASS OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE BETRAYED THEM BY MAKING UNDER SIMIANS OF THEM
3857-182317-0003 LOVING US THEY LET US STOP THEIR DEVELOPING IN TUNE WITH THEIR NATURES AND THEY'VE PATIENTLY TRIED EVER SINCE TO ADOPT WAYS OF OURS THEY HAVE DONE IT TOO BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN'T GET FAR IT'S NOT THEIR OWN ROAD
3857-182317-0004 DOGS HAVE MORE LOVE THAN INTEGRITY THEY'VE BEEN TRUE TO US YES BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES PIGS THE PIG IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND BRAVE BUT HE'S GROSS
3857-182317-0005 AND GROSSNESS DELAYS ONE'S ACHIEVEMENT IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME THE SNAKE TOO THOUGH WISE HAS A WAY OF EATING HIMSELF INTO STUPORS IF SUPER SNAKE MEN HAD HAD BANQUETS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO VAST TO DESCRIBE
3857-182317-0006 AND WELL SHOULD THE ELEPHANT KNOW IT HE HAD THE BEST CHANCE OF ALL WISER EVEN THAN THE LION OR THE WISEST OF APES HIS WISDOM FURTHERMORE WAS BENIGN WHERE THEIRS WAS SINISTER CONSIDER HIS DIGNITY HIS POISE AND SKILL
3857-182317-0007 HE WAS PLASTIC TOO HE HAD LEARNED TO EAT MANY FOODS AND ENDURE MANY CLIMATES ONCE SOME SAY THIS RACE EXPLORED THE GLOBE THEIR BONES ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN
3857-182317-0008 SO THE ELEPHANTS COLUMBUS MAY HAVE FOUND SOME ROAD HERE BEFORE OURS THEY ARE COSMOPOLITANS THESE SUAVE AND WELL BRED BEINGS THEY HAVE RICH EMOTIONAL NATURES LONG MEMORIES LOYALTY THEY ARE STEADY AND SURE
3857-182317-0009 AND NOT NARROW NOT SELF ABSORBED FOR THEY SEEM INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT PUT THEM OUT OF THE RACE COULD IT HAVE BEEN A QUITE NATURAL BELIEF THAT THEY HAD ALREADY WON AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY HADN'T
3857-182317-0010 AND THAT THE MONKEY MEN WERE GETTING AHEAD WERE THEY TOO GREAT MINDED AND DECENT TO EXTERMINATE THEIR PUNY RIVALS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE THAT BETRAYED THEM THEY WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE THEY RESENT AN IMPOSITION OR INSULT
3857-182317-0011 JUST AS ANTS ARE TOO ENERGETIC AND CATS TOO SHREWD FOR THEIR OWN HIGHEST GOOD SO THE ELEPHANTS SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH PATIENCE THEIR EXHIBITIONS OF IT MAY SEEM SUPERB SUCH POWER AND SUCH RESTRAINT COMBINED ARE NOBLE
3857-182317-0012 MORE LIVE AND LET LIVE IN ALLOWING OTHER SPECIES TO STAY HERE OUR WAY IS TO KILL GOOD AND BAD MALE AND FEMALE AND BABIES TILL THE FEW LAST SURVIVORS LIE HIDDEN AWAY FROM OUR GUNS
3857-182317-0013 ALL SPECIES MUST SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY THOSE ARE OUR TERMS AND COME AND LIVE IN BARNS ALONGSIDE US OR ON US AS PARASITES THE CREATURES THAT WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN WE CALL WILD IF WILD
3857-182317-0014 THEN NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS WE TREAT THEM AS OUTLAWS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE SPECIALLY WELL BROUGHT UP SHOOT THEM FOR FUN SOME MIGHT BE OUR FRIENDS WE DON'T WISH IT WE KEEP THEM ALL TERRORIZED
3857-182317-0015 WHEN ONE OF US CONQUERING MONKEY MEN ENTERS THE WOODS MOST ANIMALS THAT SCENT HIM SLINK AWAY OR RACE OFF IN A PANIC IT IS NOT THAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS DELIBERATELY BUT THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE LIKE RACE BY RACE THEY HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED
3857-182317-0016 SOON ALL WILL BE GONE WE GIVE NEITHER FREEDOM NOR LIFE ROOM TO THOSE WE DEFEAT IF WE HAD BEEN AS STRONG AS THE ELEPHANTS WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER WHEN GREAT POWER COMES NATURALLY TO PEOPLE
3857-182317-0017 IT IS USED MORE URBANELY WE USE IT AS PARVENUS DO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE THE ELEPHANT BEING BORN TO IT IS EASY GOING CONFIDENT TOLERANT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE HUMANE KING
3857-182317-0018 THE ELEPHANT IS STUPID WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING HOW TO USE TOOLS SO ARE ALL OTHER SPECIES EXCEPT OUR OWN ISN'T IT STRANGE A TOOL IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE SENSE IS ANY OBJECT LYING AROUND
3857-182317-0019 THAT CAN OBVIOUSLY BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THIS OR THAT PURPOSE MANY CREATURES USE OBJECTS AS MATERIALS AS BIRDS USE TWIGS FOR NESTS BUT THE STEP THAT NO ANIMAL TAKES IS LEARNING FREELY TO USE THINGS AS INSTRUMENTS
3857-182317-0020 WHEN AN ELEPHANT PLUCKS OFF A BRANCH AND SWISHES HIS FLANKS AND THUS KEEPS AWAY INSECTS HE IS USING A TOOL BUT HE DOES IT ONLY BY A VAGUE AND HAPHAZARD ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS IF HE ONCE BECAME A CONSCIOUS USER OF TOOLS
3857-182317-0021 HE WOULD OF COURSE GO MUCH FURTHER WE OURSELVES WHO ARE SO GOOD AT IT NOW WERE SLOW ENOUGH IN BEGINNING THINK OF THE LONG EPOCHS THAT PASSED BEFORE IT ENTERED OUR HEADS
3857-182317-0022 AND ALL THAT WHILE THE CONTEST FOR LEADERSHIP BLINDLY WENT ON WITHOUT ANY SPECIES MAKING USE OF THIS OBVIOUS AID THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED WAS SIMPLE THE REWARD WAS THE RULE OF A PLANET YET ONLY ONE SPECIES OUR OWN
3857-182317-0023 HAS EVER HAD THAT MUCH BRAINS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER OBVIOUS LESSONS MAY STILL BE UNLEARNED IT IS NOT NECESSARILY STUPID HOWEVER TO FAIL TO USE TOOLS TO USE TOOLS INVOLVES USING REASON
3857-182317-0024 INSTEAD OF STICKING TO INSTINCT NOW STICKING TO INSTINCT HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES BUT SO HAS USING REASON WHICHEVER FACULTY YOU USE THE OTHER ATROPHIES AND PARTLY DESERTS YOU WE ARE TRYING TO USE BOTH
3857-182317-0025 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH HAS THE MORE VALUE A SUDDEN VISION COMES TO ME OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAR AWAY APE MEN WHO TRIED TO USE REASON INSTEAD OF INSTINCT AS A GUIDE FOR HIS CONDUCT I IMAGINE HIM PERCHED IN HIS TREE
3857-182317-0026 TORN BETWEEN THOSE TWO VOICES WAILING LOUDLY AT NIGHT BY A RIVER IN HIS PUZZLED DISTRESS MY POOR FAR OFF BROTHER
3857-182317-0027 AND THEREAFTER ACHIEVE A HIGH CIVILIZATION BUT THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM THE REAL PROBLEM
3857-182317-0028 SOME QUENCHLESS DESIRE TO URGE THEM ON AND ON AND ALSO ADAPTABILITY OF A THOUSAND KINDS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THE RHINOCEROS CARES LITTLE FOR ADAPTABILITY HE SLOGS THROUGH THE WORLD BUT WE
3857-182317-0029 WE ARE EXPERTS ADAPTABILITY IS WHAT WE DEPEND ON WE TALK OF OUR MASTERY OF NATURE WHICH SOUNDS VERY GRAND BUT THE FACT IS WE RESPECTFULLY ADAPT OURSELVES FIRST TO HER WAYS
3857-182317-0030 WE ATTAIN NO POWER OVER NATURE TILL WE LEARN NATURAL LAWS AND OUR LORDSHIP DEPENDS ON THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH WE LEARN AND CONFORM ADROITNESS HOWEVER IS MERELY AN ABILITY TO WIN
3857-182317-0031 BACK OF IT THERE MUST BE SOME SPUR TO MAKE US USE OUR ADROITNESS WHY DON'T WE ALL DIE OR GIVE UP WHEN WE'RE SICK OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE LOVE OF LIFE IS REENFORCED IN MOST ENERGIZED BEINGS
3857-182317-0032 BY SOME LONGING THAT PUSHES THEM FORWARD IN DEFEAT AND IN DARKNESS ALL CREATURES WISH TO LIVE AND TO PERPETUATE THEIR SPECIES OF COURSE BUT THOSE TWO WISHES ALONE EVIDENTLY DO NOT CARRY ANY RACE FAR
3857-182317-0033 IN ADDITION TO THESE A RACE TO BE GREAT NEEDS SOME HUNGER SOME ITCH TO SPUR IT UP THE HARD PATH WE LATELY HAVE LEARNED TO CALL EVOLUTION THE LOVE OF TOIL IN THE ANTS AND OF CRAFT IN CATS ARE EXAMPLES
8630-305213-0000 CHAPTER SIX HOW SAINT MONICA LIVED IN THE DAYS OF HER WIDOWHOOD AND HOW SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST IN GOD PATRICIUS HAD NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WORLDLY GOODS TO LEAVE TO HIS WIFE
8630-305213-0001 SHE NEEDED LITTLE IT IS TRUE FOR HERSELF BUT THERE WAS AUGUSTINE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR HER EVEN IF SHE PRACTISED THE STRICTEST ECONOMY TO KEEP HIM AT CARTHAGE WHERE HE WAS DOING SO WELL
8630-305213-0002 ROMANIANUS DIVINED HER ANXIETY AND HASTENED TO SET IT AT REST HE HAD A HOUSE IN CARTHAGE HE SAID IT SHOULD BE AUGUSTINE'S AS LONG AS HE REQUIRED IT
8630-305213-0003 THIS WOULD SETTLE THE QUESTION OF LODGING FOR THE REST CONTINUED ROMANIANUS AS AN OLD FRIEND OF PATRICIUS HE HAD THE RIGHT TO BEFRIEND HIS SON AND MONICA MUST GRANT HIM THE PRIVILEGE
8630-305213-0004 OF ACTING A FATHER'S PART TO AUGUSTINE UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY LAUNCHED IN LIFE HE HAD A CHILD OF HIS OWN
8630-305213-0005 IF MONICA WOULD BEFRIEND HIS BOY THEY WOULD BE QUITS THE GRATITUDE OF BOTH MOTHER AND SON TOWARDS THIS GENEROUS FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR LASTED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
8630-305213-0006 YOU IT WAS ROMANIANUS WROTE AUGUSTINE IN HIS CONFESSIONS WHO WHEN I WAS A POOR YOUNG STUDENT IN CARTHAGE OPENED TO ME YOUR HOUSE YOUR PURSE AND STILL MORE YOUR HEART
8630-305213-0007 YOU IT WAS WHO WHEN I HAD THE SORROW TO LOSE MY FATHER COMFORTED ME BY YOUR FRIENDSHIP HELPED ME WITH YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTED ME WITH YOUR FORTUNE
8630-305213-0008 MONICA MOURNED HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WITH TRUE DEVOTION BUT HERS WAS NOT A SELFISH SORROW SHE HAD LOVE AND SYMPATHY FOR ALL WHO NEEDED THEM
8630-305213-0009 AND FORGOT HER OWN GRIEF IN SOLACING THAT OF OTHERS THERE WERE CERTAIN GOOD WORKS WHICH THE CHURCH GAVE TO CHRISTIAN WIDOWS TO PERFORM THE HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE WERE ENTIRELY IN THEIR HANDS
8630-305213-0010 THEY WERE SMALL AS YET BUILT ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOMENT FROM THE FUNDS OF THE FAITHFUL AND HELD BUT FEW PATIENTS THESE DEVOTED WOMEN SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER AT INTERVALS
8630-305213-0011 IN THEIR TASK OF WASHING AND ATTENDING TO THE SICK WATCHING BY THEIR BEDS AND CLEANING THEIR ROOMS THEIR MINISTRATIONS DID NOT EVEN CEASE THERE WITH REVERENT CARE THEY PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
8630-305213-0012 THINKING THE WHILE OF THE PREPARATION OF CHRIST'S BODY FOR THE TOMB AND OF HIM WHO SAID INASMUCH AS YE DO IT TO THE LEAST OF MY BRETHREN YE DO IT UNTO ME
8630-305213-0013 IT WAS A HAPPY MOMENT FOR MONICA WHEN HER TURN CAME TO SERVE THE SICK SHE WOULD KISS THEIR SORES FOR VERY PITY AS SHE WASHED AND DRESSED THEM AND THEIR FACES GREW BRIGHT AT HER COMING
8630-305213-0014 THEY CALLED HER MOTHER IT SEEMED SUCH A NATURAL NAME TO GIVE HER FOR SHE WAS A MOTHER TO THEM ALL AND GAVE THEM A MOTHER'S LOVE TO SOME OF THE POOR CREATURES FRIENDLESS SLAVES AS THEY OFTEN WERE
8630-305213-0015 WHO HAD KNOWN LITTLE SYMPATHY OR TENDERNESS IN THEIR HARD LIVES IT WAS A REVELATION OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH TAUGHT THEM MORE THAN HOURS OF PREACHING COULD HAVE DONE BUT THERE WAS OTHER WORK BESIDES THAT AT THE HOSPITAL
8630-305213-0016 THERE WERE THE POOR TO BE HELPED THE HUNGRY TO BE FED THE NAKED TO BE CLOTHED SHE WOULD GATHER THE ORPHAN CHILDREN AT HER KNEE TO TEACH THEM THE TRUTHS OF THEIR FAITH WHEN THEY WERE VERY POOR
8630-305213-0017 SHE WOULD KEEP THEM IN HER OWN HOUSE FEED THEM AT HER OWN TABLE AND CLOTHE THEM WITH HER OWN HANDS IF I AM A MOTHER TO THESE MOTHERLESS ONES SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF HE WILL HAVE MERCY AND GIVE ME BACK MY BOY
8630-305213-0018 IF I TEACH THEM TO KNOW AND LOVE HIM AS A FATHER HE WILL WATCH OVER MY SON IT WAS A CUSTOM OF THE TIME ON THE FEASTS OF SAINTS AND MARTYRS TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO THEIR TOMBS
8630-305213-0019 WITH A LITTLE BASKET OF FOOD AND WINE THIS WAS LAID ON THE GRAVE AFTER WHICH THE FAITHFUL WOULD PARTAKE OF WHAT THEY HAD BROUGHT WHILE THEY THOUGHT AND SPOKE OF THE NOBLE LIVES OF GOD'S SERVANTS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
8630-305213-0020 THE CUSTOM WAS ABOLISHED NOT LONG AFTER ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABUSES WHICH HAD ARISEN BUT MONICA OBSERVED IT TO THE END SHE SCARCELY TASTED OF HER OFFERING HERSELF
8630-305213-0021 BUT GAVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE POOR OFTEN INDEED SHE WENT COLD AND HUNGRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE CLOTHED AND FED HER LOVE OF PRAYER TOO COULD NOW FIND FULL SCOPE
8630-305213-0022 EVERY MORNING FOUND HER IN HER PLACE IN CHURCH FOR THE HOLY SACRIFICE EVERY EVENING SHE WAS THERE AGAIN SILENT ABSORBED IN GOD THE PLACE WHERE SHE KNELT WAS OFTEN WET WITH HER TEARS
8630-305213-0023 THE TIME PASSED BY UNHEEDED PATRICIUS HER HUSBAND WAS SAFE IN GOD'S HANDS BUT AUGUSTINE HER ELDEST BORN HER DARLING IN WHAT DARK PATHS WAS HE WANDERING
8630-305213-0024 AND YET IN HER HEART OF HEARTS THERE WAS A DEEP CONVICTION THAT NO SAD NEWS OF HIS LIFE AT CARTHAGE COULD SHAKE HIS WAS NOT THE NATURE TO FIND CONTENTMENT IN THE THINGS OF EARTH
8630-305213-0025 HE WAS BORN TO SOMETHING HIGHER HIS NOBLE HEART HIS STRONG INTELLIGENCE WOULD BRING HIM BACK TO GOD AND YET AND YET
8630-305213-0026 HER HEART SANK AS SHE THOUGHT OF GRACES WASTED OF CONSCIENCE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT OF LIGHT REJECTED NO THERE WAS NO HOPE ANYWHERE BUT WITH GOD IN HIM SHE WOULD TRUST AND IN HIM ALONE
8630-305213-0027 HE WAS INFINITE IN MERCY AND STRONG TO SAVE HE HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NEVER FAIL THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM AT HIS FEET AND AT HIS FEET ALONE
8630-305213-0028 MONICA POURED OUT HER TEARS AND HER SORROW WITH OTHERS SHE WAS SERENE AND HOPEFUL AS OF OLD EVEN JOYOUS ALWAYS READY TO HELP AND COMFORT IT WAS SAID OF HER AFTER HER DEATH
8630-305213-0029 THAT NO ONE HAD SUCH A GIFT OF HELPING OTHERS AS SHE SHE NEVER PREACHED AT PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE HAVE AN INSURMOUNTABLE DISLIKE TO BEING PREACHED AT BUT EVERY WORD SHE SAID HAD A STRANGE POWER OF DRAWING SOULS TO GOD
8630-305213-0030 OF MAKING THEM WISH TO BE BETTER AUGUSTINE MEANWHILE AT CARTHAGE WAS JUSTIFYING ALL THE HOPES THAT HAD BEEN FORMED OF HIM HE HAD EVEN GREATER GIFTS IT SEEMED THAN ELOQUENCE FEELING AND WIT
8630-305213-0031 HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF HIS CLASS IN RHETORIC HIS MASTER HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF A CERTAIN TREATISE OF ARISTOTLE WHICH HE WOULD SOON BE CALLED UPON TO STUDY IT WAS SO PROFOUND HE SAID THAT FEW COULD UNDERSTAND IT
8630-305213-0032 EVEN WITH THE HELP OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS AUGUSTINE EAGER TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WONDERFUL WORK PROCURED IT AT ONCE AND READ IT IT SEEMED TO HIM PERFECTLY SIMPLE IT WAS UNNECESSARY HE FOUND
8630-305213-0033 TO ASK A SINGLE EXPLANATION IT WAS THE SAME WITH GEOMETRY MUSIC EVERY SCIENCE HE TOOK UP THIS YOUNG GENIUS OF NINETEEN ONLY DISCOVERED THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY
8630-305213-0034 WHEN HE HAD TO TEACH OTHERS AND REALIZED HOW HARD IT WAS TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE TO HIMSELF THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY SYMPATHETIC AND ATTRACTIVE ABOUT AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0035 HE SEEMED MODEST AND RESERVED ABOUT HIS OWN GIFTS ALTHOUGH HE HIMSELF TELLS US IN HIS CONFESSIONS THAT HE WAS FULL OF PRIDE AND AMBITION HE HAD A GIFT OF MAKING TRUE AND FAITHFUL FRIENDS A CHARM IN CONVERSATION
8630-305213-0036 THAT DREW HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS AND EVEN OLDER MEN TO HIS SIDE A MORE WORLDLY MOTHER THAN MONICA WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY PROUD OF HER SON FAITH AND VIRTUE WERE ALONE WEAK AND FAINT IN THAT SOUL
8630-305213-0037 THAT COULD SO ILL DO WITHOUT THEM BUT TO HER THEY WERE THE ONE ESSENTIAL THING THE REST DID NOT MATTER YET MONICA WITH TRUE INSIGHT BELIEVED THAT WITH NOBLE MINDS KNOWLEDGE MUST DRAW MEN TO GOD
8630-305213-0038 SHE HOPED MUCH THEREFORE THAT AUGUSTINE'S BRILLIANCE OF INTELLECT WOULD SAVE HIM IN THE END AND HER HOPES WERE NOT DECEIVED ALREADY THE NOBLE PHILOSOPHY OF CICERO
8630-305213-0039 PAGAN THOUGH HE WAS HAD AWAKENED A THIRST FOR WISDOM IN THE YOUNG STUDENT'S SOUL ALREADY HE FELT THE EMPTINESS OF EARTHLY JOYS I LONGED MY GOD HE WRITES
8630-305213-0040 AND I KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS THOU THAT WAST WORKING IN ME ONE THING COOLED MY ARDOUR HE GOES ON TO SAY IT WAS THAT THE NAME OF CHRIST WAS NOT THERE AND THIS NAME BY THY MERCY LORD
8630-305213-0041 OF THY SON MY SAVIOUR MY HEART HAD DRAWN IN WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK AND KEPT IN ITS DEPTHS AND EVERY DOCTRINE WHERE THIS NAME DID NOT APPEAR FLUENT ELEGANT AND TRUTH LIKE THOUGH IT MIGHT BE
8630-305213-0042 COULD NOT MASTER ME ALTOGETHER HE THEN TURNED TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES BUT THEY APPEARED TO HIM INFERIOR IN STYLE TO CICERO MY PRIDE HE WRITES
8630-305213-0043 DESPISED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE THINGS ARE SAID AND MY INTELLIGENCE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE HIDDEN SENSE
8630-305213-0044 AND I DISDAINED TO HUMBLE MYSELF AND INFLATED WITH VAINGLORY I BELIEVED MYSELF GREAT IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE MANICHEANS WHOSE ERRORS ATTRACTED HIM AT ONCE
8630-305213-0045 THIS EXTRAORDINARY HERESY HAD BEGUN IN THE EAST AND HAD SPREAD ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD ITS FOLLOWERS FORMED A SECRET SOCIETY WITH SIGNS AND PASSWORDS GRADES AND INITIATIONS
8630-305213-0046 TO IMPOSE ON CHRISTIANS THEY USED CHRISTIAN WORDS FOR DOCTRINES THAT WERE THOROUGHLY UNCHRISTIAN PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR HATRED OF THE CHURCH AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0047 WHO REMAINED AMONGST THEM FOR NINE YEARS THUS DESCRIBES THEM WHEN WRITING TO A FRIEND THOU KNOWEST HONORATUS THAT FOR THIS REASON ALONE DID WE FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THESE MEN
8630-305213-0048 NAMELY THAT THEY PROFESSED TO FREE US FROM ALL ERRORS AND BRING US TO GOD BY PURE REASON ALONE WITHOUT THAT TERRIBLE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY FOR WHAT ELSE INDUCED ME TO ABANDON THE FAITH OF MY CHILDHOOD
8630-305213-0049 AND FOLLOW THESE MEN FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS BUT THEIR ASSERTION THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED BY SUPERSTITION INTO A FAITH BLINDLY IMPOSED UPON OUR REASON WHILE THEY URGED NO ONE TO BELIEVE
8630-305213-0050 UNTIL THE TRUTH WAS FULLY DISCUSSED AND PROVED WHO WOULD NOT BE SEDUCED BY SUCH PROMISES ESPECIALLY IF HE WERE A PROUD CONTENTIOUS YOUNG MAN THIRSTING FOR TRUTH SUCH AS THEY THEN FOUND ME
8630-305213-0051 THAT WAS WHAT THE MANICHEANS PROMISED WHAT AUGUSTINE FOUND AMONGST THEM HE ALSO TELLS US THEY INCESSANTLY REPEATED TO ME TRUTH TRUTH BUT THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THEM
8630-305213-0052 THEY TAUGHT WHAT WAS FALSE NOT ONLY ABOUT THEE MY GOD WHO ART THE VERY TRUTH BUT EVEN ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THIS WORLD THY CREATURES SO MUCH FOR THEIR DOCTRINES AS FOR THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES
8630-305213-0053 HE FOUND THEM CARNAL AND LOQUACIOUS FULL OF INSANE PRIDE THE GREAT CHARM OF MANICHEISM TO AUGUSTINE WAS THAT IT TAUGHT THAT A MAN WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SINS THIS DOCTRINE WAS CONVENIENT TO ONE
8630-305213-0054 WHO COULD NOT FIND THE STRENGTH TO BREAK WITH HIS BAD HABITS SUCH WAS MY MIND HE SUMS UP LATER LOOKING BACK ON THIS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE SO WEIGHED DOWN SO BLINDED BY THE FLESH
7113-86041-0000 RUBEZAHL OVER ALL THE VAST UNDER WORLD THE MOUNTAIN GNOME RUBEZAHL WAS LORD AND BUSY ENOUGH THE CARE OF HIS DOMINIONS KEPT HIM THERE WERE THE ENDLESS TREASURE CHAMBERS TO BE GONE THROUGH
7113-86041-0001 AND THE HOSTS OF GNOMES TO BE KEPT TO THEIR TASKS SOME BUILT STRONG BARRIERS TO HOLD BACK THE FIERY VAPOURS TO CHANGE DULL STONES TO PRECIOUS METAL OR WERE HARD AT WORK FILLING EVERY CRANNY OF THE ROCKS WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES
7113-86041-0002 FOR RUBEZAHL LOVED ALL PRETTY THINGS SOMETIMES THE FANCY WOULD TAKE HIM TO LEAVE THOSE GLOOMY REGIONS AND COME OUT UPON THE GREEN EARTH FOR A WHILE AND BASK IN THE SUNSHINE AND HEAR THE BIRDS SING
7113-86041-0003 AND AS GNOMES LIVE MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS HE SAW STRANGE THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE CAME UP THE GREAT HILLS WERE COVERED WITH THICK FORESTS
7113-86041-0004 TO HEAR THE THUNDER OF THEIR FALL ECHOING AMONG THE HILLS BUT THE NEXT TIME HE VENTURED ABOVE GROUND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND EVERYTHING CHANGED THE DARK WOODS WERE HEWN DOWN
7113-86041-0005 AND IN THEIR PLACE APPEARED BLOSSOMING ORCHARDS SURROUNDING COSY LOOKING THATCHED COTTAGES FOR EVERY CHIMNEY THE BLUE SMOKE CURLED PEACEFULLY INTO THE AIR SHEEP AND OXEN FED IN THE FLOWERY MEADOWS
7113-86041-0006 CAME THE MUSIC OF THE SHEPHERD'S PIPE THE STRANGENESS AND PLEASANTNESS OF THE SIGHT SO DELIGHTED THE GNOME THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF RESENTING THE INTRUSION OF THESE UNEXPECTED GUESTS WHO WITHOUT SAYING BY YOUR LEAVE OR WITH YOUR LEAVE
7113-86041-0007 NOR DID HE WISH TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR DOINGS BUT LEFT THEM IN QUIET POSSESSION OF THEIR HOMES AS A GOOD HOUSEHOLDER LEAVES IN PEACE THE SWALLOWS WHO HAVE BUILT THEIR NESTS UNDER HIS EAVES
7113-86041-0008 HE WAS INDEED GREATLY MINDED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THIS BEING CALLED MAN SO TAKING THE FORM OF AN OLD FIELD LABOURER HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A FARMER UNDER HIS CARE ALL THE CROPS FLOURISHED EXCEEDINGLY
7113-86041-0009 BUT THE MASTER PROVED TO BE WASTEFUL AND UNGRATEFUL AND RUBEZAHL SOON LEFT HIM AND WENT TO BE SHEPHERD TO HIS NEXT NEIGHBOUR
7113-86041-0010 AND WHERE AMONG THE HILLS TO LOOK FOR ANY WHO STRAYED AWAY THAT THEY TOO PROSPERED UNDER HIS CARE AND NOT ONE WAS LOST OR TORN BY WOLVES BUT THIS NEW MASTER WAS A HARD MAN AND BEGRUDGED HIM HIS WELL EARNED WAGES
7113-86041-0011 SO HE RAN AWAY AND WENT TO SERVE THE JUDGE HERE HE UPHELD THE LAW WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND WAS A TERROR TO THIEVES AND EVILDOERS BUT THE JUDGE WAS A BAD MAN WHO TOOK BRIBES AND DESPISED THE LAW
7113-86041-0012 DOWN TO HIS UNDERGROUND PALACE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED BY HIS FIRST EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND BUT AS TIME WENT ON HE FORGOT THE DISAGREEABLE THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND THOUGHT HE WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE UPPER WORLD
7113-86041-0013 WHERE STOOD A CHARMING MAIDEN FRESH AS THE SPRING AND BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK UPON AROUND HER UPON THE GRASS LAY HER YOUNG COMPANIONS AS IF THEY HAD THROWN THEMSELVES DOWN TO REST AFTER SOME MERRY GAME
7113-86041-0014 BEYOND THEM FLOWED A LITTLE BROOK INTO WHICH A WATERFALL LEAPT FROM A HIGH ROCK FILLING THE AIR WITH ITS PLEASANT SOUND AND MAKING A COOLNESS EVEN IN THE SULTRY NOONTIDE
7113-86041-0015 THE SIGHT OF THE MAIDEN SO PLEASED THE GNOME THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WISHED HIMSELF A MORTAL AND LONGING FOR A BETTER VIEW OF THE GAY COMPANY HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A RAVEN
7113-86041-0016 HE COULD ONLY SEE WITH A RAVEN'S EYES AND FEEL AS A RAVEN FEELS AND A NEST OF FIELD MICE AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE INTERESTED HIM FAR MORE THAN THE SPORT OF THE MAIDENS
7113-86041-0017 WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THIS HE FLEW DOWN AGAIN IN A GREAT HURRY INTO THE THICKET AND TOOK THE FORM OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT WAS THE BEST WAY AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL THEN AND THERE
7113-86041-0018 THE FAIR MAIDEN WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THE COUNTRY AND SHE OFTEN WANDERED IN THE FOREST WITH HER PLAY FELLOWS GATHERING THE WILD FLOWERS AND FRUITS TILL THE MIDDAY HEAT DROVE THE MERRY BAND TO THE SHADY LAWN
7113-86041-0019 BY THE BROOK TO REST OR TO BATHE IN THE COOL WATERS ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING THE FANCY TOOK THEM TO WANDER OFF AGAIN INTO THE WOOD THIS
7113-86041-0020 STEPPING OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE
7113-86041-0021 WEAVING HIS MAGIC SPELLS TILL SLOWLY ALL ABOUT HIM CHANGED AND WHEN THE MAIDENS RETURNED AT NOON TO THEIR FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE THEY STOOD LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND ALMOST FANCIED THAT THEY MUST BE DREAMING
7113-86041-0022 THE RED ROCKS HAD BECOME WHITE MARBLE AND ALABASTER THE STREAM THAT MURMURED AND STRUGGLED BEFORE IN ITS ROCKY BED FLOWED IN SILENCE NOW IN ITS SMOOTH CHANNEL FROM WHICH A CLEAR FOUNTAIN LEAPT
7113-86041-0023 AS THE WANDERING BREEZE SCATTERED IT DAISIES AND FORGET ME NOTS FRINGED ITS BRINK WHILE TALL HEDGES OF ROSES AND JASMINE RINGED IT ROUND MAKING THE SWEETEST AND DAINTIEST BOWER IMAGINABLE
7113-86041-0024 WERE SPREAD OUT STRANGE FRUITS AND SWEETMEATS THE VERY SIGHT OF WHICH MADE THE PRINCESS LONG TO TASTE THEM SHE HESITATED A WHILE HOWEVER SCARCELY ABLE TO BELIEVE HER EYES
7113-86041-0025 BUT AT LENGTH CURIOSITY PREVAILED AND SHE AND HER COMPANIONS EXPLORED TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT
7113-86041-0026 RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER IN HIGH GLEE AND CALLING MERRILY TO EACH OTHER AT LAST WHEN THEY WERE QUITE WEARY THE PRINCESS CRIED OUT SUDDENLY THAT NOTHING WOULD CONTENT HER BUT TO BATHE IN THE MARBLE POOL
7113-86041-0027 WHICH CERTAINLY DID LOOK VERY INVITING AND THEY ALL WENT GAILY TO THIS NEW AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS WAS READY FIRST BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SLIPPED OVER THE RIM OF THE POOL WHEN DOWN DOWN DOWN SHE SANK
7113-86041-0028 AND VANISHED IN ITS DEPTHS BEFORE HER FRIGHTENED PLAYMATES COULD SEIZE HER BY SO MUCH AS A LOCK OF HER FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR LOUDLY DID THEY WEEP AND WAIL RUNNING ABOUT THE BRINK OF THE POOL WHICH LOOKED SO SHALLOW AND SO CLEAR
7113-86041-0029 BUT WHICH HAD SWALLOWED UP THEIR PRINCESS BEFORE THEIR EYES THEY EVEN SPRANG INTO THE WATER AND TRIED TO DIVE AFTER HER BUT IN VAIN THEY ONLY FLOATED LIKE CORKS IN THE ENCHANTED POOL AND COULD NOT KEEP UNDER WATER FOR A SECOND
7113-86041-0030 THEY SAW AT LAST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO CARRY TO THE KING THE SAD TIDINGS OF HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE AND WHAT GREAT WEEPING AND LAMENTATION THERE WAS IN THE PALACE WHEN THE DREADFUL NEWS WAS TOLD
7113-86041-0031 THE SCENE OF THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE THINKING AS PEOPLE WILL IN SORROW THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISTAKE AFTER ALL BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT BEHOLD ALL WAS CHANGED AGAIN
7113-86041-0032 THE GLITTERING GROTTO DESCRIBED TO HIM BY THE MAIDENS HAD COMPLETELY VANISHED AND SO HAD THE MARBLE BATH THE BOWER OF JASMINE INSTEAD ALL WAS A TANGLE OF FLOWERS AS IT HAD BEEN OF OLD
7113-86041-0033 THE KING WAS SO MUCH PERPLEXED THAT HE THREATENED THE PRINCESS'S PLAYFELLOWS WITH ALL SORTS OF PUNISHMENTS IF THEY WOULD NOT CONFESS SOMETHING ABOUT HER DISAPPEARANCE BUT AS THEY ONLY REPEATED THE SAME STORY HE PRESENTLY PUT DOWN THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE WORK OF SOME
7113-86041-0034 SPRITE OR GOBLIN AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF FOR HIS LOSS BY ORDERING A GRAND HUNT FOR KINGS CANNOT BEAR TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT ANYTHING LONG MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY
7113-86041-0035 THEY SWAM WITH HER QUICKLY BY STRANGE UNDERGROUND WAYS TO A PALACE SO SPLENDID THAT HER FATHER'S SEEMED BUT A POOR COTTAGE IN COMPARISON WITH IT AND WHEN SHE RECOVERED FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF SEATED UPON A COUCH
7113-86041-0036 WRAPPED IN A WONDERFUL ROBE OF SATIN FASTENED WITH A SILKEN GIRDLE WHILE BESIDE HER KNELT A YOUNG MAN WHO WHISPERED THE SWEETEST SPEECHES IMAGINABLE IN HER EAR THE GNOME FOR HE IT WAS TOLD HER ALL ABOUT HIMSELF
7113-86041-0037 AND HIS GREAT UNDERGROUND KINGDOM AND PRESENTLY LED HER THROUGH THE MANY ROOMS AND HALLS OF THE PALACE AND SHOWED HER THE RARE AND WONDERFUL THINGS DISPLAYED IN THEM TILL SHE WAS FAIRLY DAZZLED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH SPLENDOUR
7113-86041-0038 ON THREE SIDES OF THE CASTLE LAY A LOVELY GARDEN WITH MASSES OF GAY SWEET FLOWERS AND VELVET LAWNS ALL COOL AND SHADY WHICH PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PRINCESS THE FRUIT TREES WERE HUNG WITH GOLDEN AND ROSY APPLES
7113-86041-0039 AND NIGHTINGALES SANG IN EVERY BUSH AS THE GNOME AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED IN THE LEAFY ALLEYS SOMETIMES GAZING AT THE MOON SOMETIMES PAUSING TO GATHER THE RAREST FLOWERS FOR HER ADORNMENT
7113-86041-0040 BUT THE PRINCESS FELT NO SUCH HAPPINESS IN SPITE OF ALL THE MAGIC DELIGHTS AROUND HER SHE WAS SAD THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SEEM CONTENT FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE GNOME HOWEVER HE SOON PERCEIVED HER MELANCHOLY
7113-86041-0041 AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS STROVE TO DISPEL THE CLOUD BUT IN VAIN AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF MEN ARE SOCIABLE CREATURES LIKE BEES OR ANTS
7113-86041-0042 WHO IS THERE I CAN FIND FOR HER TO TALK TO
7113-86041-0043 CARROTS TURNIPS AND RADISHES AND LAYING THEM CAREFULLY IN AN ELEGANT BASKET BROUGHT THEM TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAT PENSIVE IN THE SHADE OF THE ROSE BOWER LOVELIEST DAUGHTER OF EARTH SAID THE GNOME BANISH ALL SORROW
7113-86041-0044 NO MORE SHALL YOU BE LONELY IN MY DWELLING
7113-86041-0045 TAKE THIS LITTLE MANY COLOURED WAND AND WITH A TOUCH GIVE TO EACH ROOT THE FORM YOU DESIRE TO SEE WITH THIS HE LEFT HER AND THE PRINCESS WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY OPENED THE BASKET
7113-86041-0046 THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WAS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE PRINCESS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EYES AND WAS QUITE BESIDE HERSELF WITH THE JOY OF HAVING HER DEAR PLAYFELLOW WITH HER ONCE MORE HAND IN HAND THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE ENCHANTED GARDEN
7113-86041-0047 AND GATHERED THE GOLDEN APPLES FROM THE TREES AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS LED HER FRIEND THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL ROOMS OF THE PALACE UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE ONE IN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL THE MARVELLOUS DRESSES AND ORNAMENTS
7113-86041-0048 THE GNOME HAD GIVEN TO HIS HOPED FOR BRIDE THERE THEY FOUND SO MUCH TO AMUSE THEM THAT THE HOURS PASSED LIKE MINUTES VEILS GIRDLES AND NECKLACES WERE TRIED ON AND ADMIRED
7113-86041-0049 AND SHOWED SO MUCH TASTE THAT NOBODY
7113-86041-0050 THE GNOME WHO HAD SECRETLY BEEN KEEPING AN EYE UPON THEM WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THE HEART OF A WOMAN AND THE PRINCESS SEEMED TO HIM EVEN MORE CHARMING THAN BEFORE
7113-86041-0051 SHE DID NOT FORGET TO TOUCH THE REST OF THE ROOTS WITH HER MAGIC WAND AND SOON HAD ALL HER MAIDENS ABOUT HER AND EVEN AS SHE HAD TWO TINY RADISHES TO SPARE
7113-86041-0052 WHOSE NAME WAS BENI AND NOW ALL WENT CHEERFULLY IN THE CASTLE THE PRINCESS GAVE TO EACH OF THE MAIDENS HER TASK AND NEVER WAS MISTRESS BETTER SERVED FOR A WHOLE WEEK SHE ENJOYED THE DELIGHT OF HER PLEASANT COMPANY UNDISTURBED
7113-86041-0053 THEY PLAYED FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ONLY THE PRINCESS NOTICED THAT DAY BY DAY THE FRESH YOUNG FACES OF HER MAIDENS GREW PALE AND WAN AND THE MIRROR IN THE GREAT MARBLE HALL SHOWED HER THAT SHE ALONE STILL KEPT HER ROSY BLOOM
7113-86041-0054 WHILE BRUNHILDA AND THE REST FADED VISIBLY THEY ASSURED HER THAT ALL WAS WELL WITH THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY CONTINUED TO WASTE AWAY
7113-86041-0055 TAKE PART IN THE GAMES OF THE PRINCESS TILL AT LAST ONE FINE MORNING WHEN THE PRINCESS STARTED FROM BED AND HASTENED OUT TO JOIN HER GAY PLAYFELLOWS SHE SHUDDERED
7113-86041-0056 AND STARTED BACK AT THE SIGHT OF A GROUP OF SHRIVELLED CRONES WITH BENT BACKS AND TREMBLING LIMBS WHO SUPPORTED THEIR TOTTERING STEPS WITH STAVES AND CRUTCHES AND COUGHED DISMALLY A LITTLE NEARER TO THE HEARTH
7113-86041-0057 LAY THE ONCE FROLICSOME BENI WITH ALL FOUR FEET STRETCHED STIFFLY OUT WHILE THE SLEEK CAT SEEMED TOO WEAK TO RAISE HIS HEAD FROM HIS VELVET CUSHION THE HORRIFIED PRINCESS FLED TO THE DOOR
7113-86041-0058 THE GREATEST DELIGHT OF MY LONELY HOURS ISN'T THIS SOLITARY LIFE IN SUCH A DESERT BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR TURNING THE CASTLE INTO A HOSPITAL FOR THE AGED GIVE MY MAIDENS BACK THEIR YOUTH AND HEALTH THIS VERY MINUTE OR I WILL NEVER LOVE YOU
7113-86041-0059 SWEETEST AND FAIREST OF DAMSELS CRIED THE GNOME DO NOT BE ANGRY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN MY POWER I WILL DO BUT DO NOT ASK THE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SAP WAS FRESH IN THE ROOTS
7113-86041-0060 THE MAGIC STAFF COULD KEEP THEM IN THE FORMS YOU DESIRED BUT AS THE SAP DRIED UP THEY WITHERED AWAY BUT NEVER TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THAT DEAREST ONE A BASKET OF FRESH TURNIPS WILL SOON SET MATTERS RIGHT
7113-86041-0061 AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY CALL UP AGAIN EVERY FORM YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREAT GREEN PATCH IN THE GARDEN WILL PROVE YOU WITH A MORE LIVELY COMPANY SO SAYING THE GNOME TOOK HIMSELF OFF
7113-86041-0062 AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MAGIC WAND TOUCHED THE WRINKLED OLD WOMEN AND LEFT THEM THE WITHERED ROOTS THEY REALLY WERE TO BE THROWN UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP AND WITH LIGHT FEET SKIPPED OFF ACROSS TO THE MEADOW
7113-86041-0063 TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FRESHLY FILLED BASKET BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN SHE SEARCHED SPYING INTO EVERY CORNER BUT NOT A SIGN OF IT WAS TO BE FOUND
7113-86041-0064 BY THE TRELLIS OF GRAPE VINES SHE MET THE GNOME WHO WAS SO MUCH EMBARRASSED AT THE SIGHT OF HER THAT SHE BECAME AWARE OF HIS CONFUSION WHILE HE WAS STILL QUITE A LONG WAY OFF
7113-86041-0065 DEAR QUEEN OF MY HEART ANSWERED HE I PRAY YOU TO FORGIVE MY CARELESSNESS I PROMISED MORE THAN I COULD PERFORM I HAVE SOUGHT ALL OVER THE LAND FOR THE ROOTS YOU DESIRE BUT THEY ARE GATHERED IN AND LIE DRYING IN MUSTY CELLARS
7113-86041-0066 AND THE FIELDS ARE BARE AND DESOLATE FOR BELOW IN THE VALLEY WINTER REIGNS ONLY HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE SPRING IS HELD FAST AND WHEREVER YOUR FOOT IS SET THE GAY FLOWERS BLOOM HAVE PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE
7113-86041-0067 AND THEN WITHOUT FAIL YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PUPPETS TO PLAY WITH ALMOST BEFORE THE GNOME HAD FINISHED THE DISAPPOINTED PRINCESS TURNED AWAY AND MARCHED OFF TO HER OWN APARTMENTS WITHOUT DEIGNING TO ANSWER HIM THE GNOME HOWEVER
7113-86041-0068 AND DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A FARMER BOUGHT AN ASS IN THE NEAREST MARKET TOWN AND BROUGHT IT BACK LOADED WITH SACKS OF TURNIP CARROT AND RADISH SEED WITH THIS HE SOWED A GREAT FIELD
7113-86041-0069 AND SENT A VAST ARMY OF HIS GOBLINS TO WATCH AND TEND IT AND TO BRING UP THE FIERY RIVERS FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH NEAR ENOUGH TO WARM AND ENCOURAGE THE SPROUTING SEEDS THUS FOSTERED THEY GREW AND FLOURISHED MARVELLOUSLY
7113-86041-0070 HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
7113-86041-0071 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE COMING OF THEIR WEDDING DAY WHEN THE BRIDE'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE TOOK PLACE THE SAD NEWS DROVE RATIBOR DISTRACTED AND AS THE DAYS WENT ON AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD OF THE PRINCESS HE FORSOOK HIS CASTLE
7113-86041-0072 AND THE SOCIETY OF MEN AND SPENT HIS DAYS IN THE WILD FORESTS ROAMING ABOUT AND CRYING HER NAME ALOUD TO THE TREES AND ROCKS MEANWHILE THE MAIDEN IN HER GORGEOUS PRISON SIGHED IN SECRET OVER HER GRIEF NOT WISHING TO AROUSE THE GNOME'S SUSPICIONS
7113-86041-0073 IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND AT LAST SHE HIT UPON A PLAN BY THIS TIME SPRING ONCE MORE REIGNED IN THE VALLEY AND THE GNOME SENT THE FIRES BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE DEEPS OF THE EARTH
7113-86041-0074 FOR THE ROOTS WHICH THEY HAD KEPT WARM THROUGH ALL THE CRUEL WINTER HAND NOW COME TO THEIR FULL SIZE DAY BY DAY THE PRINCESS PULLED UP SOME OF THEM AND MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM CONJURING UP NOW THIS LONGED FOR PERSON AND NOW THAT
7113-86041-0075 JUST FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM AS THEY APPEARED BUT SHE REALLY HAD ANOTHER PURPOSE IN VIEW ONE DAY SHE CHANGED A TINY TURNIP INTO A BEE AND SENT HIM OFF TO BRING HER SOME NEWS OF HER LOVER FLY
7113-86041-0076 SO THE BEE SPREAD HIS SHINING WINGS AND FLEW AWAY TO DO AS HE WAS BIDDEN BUT BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT A GREEDY SWALLOW MADE A SNATCH AT HIM AND TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF THE PRINCESS HER MESSENGER WAS EATEN UP
7113-86041-0077 THEN AND THERE AFTER THAT BY THE POWER OF THE WONDERFUL WAND SHE SUMMONED A CRICKET AND TAUGHT HIM THIS GREETING HOP LITTLE CRICKET TO RATIBOR AND CHIRP IN HIS EAR THAT I LOVE HIM ONLY
7113-86041-0078 BUT THAT I AM HELD CAPTIVE BY THE GNOME IN HIS PALACE UNDER THE MOUNTAINS SO THE CRICKET HOPPED OFF GAILY DETERMINED TO DO HIS BEST TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE BUT ALAS A LONG LEGGED STORK WHO WAS PRANCING ALONG THE SAME ROAD
7113-86041-0079 CAUGHT HIM IN HER CRUEL BEAK AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY A WORD HE HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN HER THROAT THESE TWO UNLUCKY VENTURES DID NOT PREVENT THE PRINCESS FROM TRYING ONCE MORE
7113-86041-0080 THIS TIME SHE CHANGED THE TURNIP INTO A MAGPIE FLUTTER FROM TREE TO TREE CHATTERING BIRD SAID SHE TILL YOU COME TO RATIBOR MY LOVE
7113-86041-0081 AND BID HIM COME WITH HORSES AND MEN THE THIRD DAY FROM THIS TO THE HILL THAT RISES FROM THE THORNY VALLEY THE MAGPIE LISTENED HOPPED AWHILE FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AND THEN DARTED AWAY
7113-86041-0082 NOW PRINCE RATIBOR WAS STILL SPENDING HIS LIFE IN WANDERING ABOUT THE WOODS AND NOT EVEN THE BEAUTY OF THE SPRING COULD SOOTHE HIS GRIEF ONE DAY AS HE SAT IN THE SHADE OF AN OAK TREE DREAMING OF HIS LOST PRINCESS AND SOMETIMES CRYING HER NAME ALOUD
7113-86041-0083 WHICH BELONGS TO AN UNLUCKY MORTAL WHO WISHES THE EARTH WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW UP HIM AND HIS MEMORY FOR EVER THEREUPON HE CAUGHT UP A GREAT STONE
7113-86041-0084 BUT THE MAGPIE IN THE TREE WHO LIKE
7113-86041-0085 UNLESS HE COULD BE FOR EVER CHATTERING
7113-86041-0086 ALL HIS GLOOM AND MISERY VANISHED IN A MOMENT AND HE ANXIOUSLY QUESTIONED THE WELCOME MESSENGER AS TO THE FATE OF THE PRINCESS BUT THE MAGPIE KNEW NO MORE THAN THE LESSON HE HAD LEARNT SO HE SOON FLUTTERED AWAY
7113-86041-0087 WHILE THE PRINCE HURRIED BACK TO HIS CASTLE TO GATHER TOGETHER A TROOP OF HORSEMEN FULL OF COURAGE FOR WHATEVER MIGHT BEFALL THE PRINCESS MEANWHILE WAS CRAFTILY PURSUING HER PLAN OF ESCAPE
7113-86041-0088 SHE LEFT OFF TREATING THE GNOME WITH COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE INDEED THERE WAS A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DAY RETURN HIS LOVE AND THE IDEA PLEASED HIM MIGHTILY THE NEXT DAY
7113-86041-0089 AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE DECKED AS A BRIDE IN THE WONDERFUL ROBES AND JEWELS WHICH THE FOND GNOME HAD PREPARED FOR HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WAS BRAIDED AND CROWNED WITH MYRTLE BLOSSOMS
7113-86041-0090 AND HER FLOWING VEIL SPARKLED WITH GEMS IN THESE MAGNIFICENT GARMENTS SHE WENT TO MEET THE GNOME UPON THE GREAT TERRACE LOVELIEST OF MAIDENS HE STAMMERED BOWING LOW BEFORE HER LET ME GAZE INTO YOUR DEAR EYES
7113-86041-0091 YOUR CONSTANCY HAS OVERCOME ME SHE SAID I CAN NO LONGER OPPOSE YOUR WISHES BUT BELIEVE MY WORDS AND SUFFER THIS VEIL STILL TO HIDE MY BLUSHES AND TEARS WHY TEARS BELOVED ONE CRIED THE GNOME ANXIOUSLY
7113-86041-0092 EVERY TEAR OF YOURS FALLS UPON MY HEART LIKE A DROP OF MOLTEN GOLD GREATLY AS I DESIRE YOUR LOVE I DO NOT ASK A SACRIFICE AH CRIED THE FALSE PRINCESS WHY DO YOU MISUNDERSTAND MY TEARS
7113-86041-0093 AND YET I AM FEARFUL A WIFE CANNOT ALWAYS CHARM AND THOUGH YOU WILL NEVER ALTER THE BEAUTY OF MORTALS IS AS A FLOWER THAT FADES HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AS LOVING AND CHARMING AS YOU ARE NOW
7113-86041-0094 ASK SOME PROOF SWEETHEART SAID HE PUT MY OBEDIENCE AND MY PATIENCE TO SOME TEST BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE BE IT SO ANSWERED THE CRAFTY MAIDEN THEN GIVE ME
7113-86041-0095 THAT SHALL BE THE TEST OF YOUR TRUTH TOWARDS ME UNWILLING AS THE GNOME WAS TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE FOR A MOMENT HE OBEYED HER COMMANDS WITHOUT DELAY AND HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN HIS TASK
7113-86041-0096 HE SKIPPED ALONG AMONG THE TURNIPS AS NIMBLE AS A GRASSHOPPER AND HAD SOON COUNTED THEM ALL BUT TO BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE HAD MADE NO MISTAKE HE THOUGHT HE WOULD JUST RUN OVER THEM AGAIN
7113-86041-0097 THIS TIME TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE THE NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT SO HE RECKONED THEM FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT NOW THE NUMBER WAS NOT THE SAME AS EITHER OF THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THIS WAS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT AS HIS MIND WAS FULL OF THE PRINCESS'S
7113-86041-0098 PRETTY LOOKS AND WORDS AS FOR THE MAIDEN NO SOONER WAS HER DELUDED LOVER FAIRLY OUT OF SIGHT THAN SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR FLIGHT SHE HAD A FINE FRESH TURNIP HIDDEN CLOSE AT HAND
7113-86041-0099 WHICH SHE CHANGED INTO A SPIRITED HORSE ALL SADDLED AND BRIDLED AND SPRINGING UPON ITS BACK SHE GALLOPED AWAY OVER HILL AND DALE TILL SHE REACHED THE THORNY VALLEY AND FLUNG HERSELF
7113-86041-0100 INTO THE ARMS OF HER BELOVED PRINCE RATIBOR MEANWHILE THE TOILING GNOME WENT THROUGH HIS TASK OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL HIS BACK ACHED AND HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE COULD NO LONGER PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
7113-86041-0101 BUT AS HE FELT TOLERABLY CERTAIN OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF TURNIPS IN THE FIELD BIG AND LITTLE TOGETHER HE HURRIED BACK EAGER TO PROVE TO HIS BELOVED ONE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND SUBMISSIVE HUSBAND HE WOULD BE HE FELT VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
7113-86041-0102 AS HE CROSSED THE MOSSY LAWN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT ALAS SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE SEARCHED EVERY THICKET AND PATH HE LOOKED BEHIND EVERY TREE AND GAZED INTO EVERY POND
7113-86041-0103 BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN HE HASTENED INTO THE PALACE AND RUSHED FROM ROOM TO ROOM PEERING INTO EVERY HOLE AND CORNER AND CALLING HER BY NAME BUT ONLY
7113-86041-0104 ECHO ANSWERED IN THE MARBLE HALLS THERE WAS NEITHER VOICE NOR FOOTSTEP THEN HE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND THROWING OFF THE MORTAL FORM THAT ENCUMBERED HIM HE FLEW OUT OF THE PALACE
7113-86041-0105 AND SOARED HIGH INTO THE AIR AND SAW THE FUGITIVE PRINCESS IN THE FAR DISTANCE JUST AS THE SWIFT HORSE CARRIED HER ACROSS THE BOUNDARY OF HIS DOMINIONS FURIOUSLY
7113-86041-0106 AND HURL A THUNDERBOLT AFTER THE FLYING MAIDEN SPLINTERING THE ROCKY BARRIERS WHICH HAD STOOD A THOUSAND YEARS BUT HIS FURY WAS VAIN THE THUNDERCLOUDS MELTED AWAY INTO A SOFT MIST
7113-86041-0107 AND THE GNOME AFTER FLYING ABOUT FOR A WHILE IN DESPAIR BEWAILING TO THE FOUR WINDS HIS UNHAPPY FATE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE PALACE AND STOLE ONCE MORE THROUGH EVERY ROOM WITH MANY SIGHS AND LAMENTATIONS
7113-86041-0108 HE PASSED THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH FOR HIM HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GOLDEN SAND OF THE PATHWAY RENEWED HIS GRIEF ALL WAS LONELY EMPTY SORROWFUL
7113-86041-0109 AND THE FORSAKEN GNOME RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE DEALINGS WITH SUCH FALSE CREATURES
7113-86041-0110 TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS UNDERGROUND KINGDOM
8797-294123-0000 TO ACHIEVE A CORRECT APPRECIATION OF THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0001 AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
8797-294123-0002 WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS
8797-294123-0003 HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
8797-294123-0004 LATER HE MAY RETURN SANS GOODS CHATTELS DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPELLED BY INSATIABLE CURIOSITY FOR A LOOK SEE BUT IT IS CURIOSITY MERELY A TIMID DEERLIKE CURIOSITY
8797-294123-0005 HE IS PREPARED TO BOUND AWAY ON HIS LONG LEGS AT THE FIRST HINT OF DANGER OR TROUBLE NORTHERN KOREA WAS A DESOLATE LAND WHEN THE JAPANESE PASSED THROUGH VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE DESERTED
8797-294123-0006 THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
8797-294123-0007 IN MANY A LONELY VILLAGE NOT AN OUNCE NOR A GRAIN OF ANYTHING COULD BE BOUGHT AND YET THERE MIGHT BE STANDING AROUND SCORES OF WHITE GARMENTED STALWART KOREANS SMOKING YARD LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING CHATTERING CEASELESSLY CHATTERING
8797-294123-0008 LOVE MONEY OR FORCE COULD NOT PROCURE FROM THEM A HORSESHOE OR A HORSESHOE NAIL UPSO WAS THEIR INVARIABLE REPLY UPSO CURSED WORD WHICH MEANS HAVE NOT GOT
8797-294123-0009 THEY HAD TRAMPED PROBABLY FORTY MILES THAT DAY DOWN FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES JUST FOR A LOOK SEE AND FORTY MILES BACK THEY WOULD CHEERFULLY TRAMP CHATTERING ALL THE WAY OVER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
8797-294123-0010 AND THE GLOOM OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL BE FILLED WITH TALL FLITTING GHOSTS BOUNDING LIKE DEER WITH GREAT SPRINGY STRIDES WHICH ONE CANNOT BUT ENVY THEY HAVE SPLENDID VIGOUR AND FINE BODIES BUT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED WITHOUT PROTEST OR RESISTANCE
8797-294123-0011 BY EVERY CHANCE FOREIGNER WHO ENTERS THEIR COUNTRY FROM THIS NERVELESS FORSAKEN KOREAN LAND I RODE DOWN UPON THE SANDY ISLANDS OF THE YALU FOR WEEKS THESE ISLANDS HAD BEEN THE DREAD BETWEEN THE LINES OF TWO FIGHTING ARMIES
8797-294123-0012 THE AIR ABOVE HAD BEEN RENT BY SCREAMING PROJECTILES THE ECHOES OF THE FINAL BATTLE HAD SCARCELY DIED AWAY THE TRAINS OF JAPANESE WOUNDED AND JAPANESE DEAD WERE TRAILING BY
8797-294123-0013 ON THE CONICAL HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY THE RUSSIAN DEAD WERE BEING BURIED IN THEIR TRENCHES AND IN THE SHELL HOLES MADE BY THE JAPANESE AND HERE IN THE THICK OF IT ALL A MAN WAS PLOUGHING GREEN THINGS WERE GROWING
8797-294123-0014 YOUNG ONIONS AND THE MAN WHO WAS WEEDING THEM PAUSED FROM HIS LABOUR LONG ENOUGH TO SELL ME A HANDFUL NEAR BY WAS THE SMOKE BLACKENED RUIN OF THE FARMHOUSE FIRED BY THE RUSSIANS WHEN THEY RETREATED FROM THE RIVERBED TWO MEN WERE REMOVING THE DEBRIS
8797-294123-0015 CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
8797-294123-0016 THERE WERE NO LOUNGING MEN SMOKING LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING THE PREVIOUS DAY THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN THERE A BLOODY BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND TO DAY THE JAPANESE WERE THERE BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY WAS BUSY
8797-294123-0017 MEN WERE OFFERING EGGS AND CHICKENS AND FRUIT FOR SALE UPON THE STREET AND BREAD AS I LIVE BREAD IN SMALL ROUND LOAVES OR BUNS I RODE ON INTO THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE A TOILING POPULATION WAS IN EVIDENCE
8797-294123-0018 THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
8797-294123-0019 TRAINS OF WHEELBARROWS HEAVILY LOADED SQUEAKED BY AND PEKIN CARTS DRAWN BY FROM FOUR TO SIX COWS HORSES MULES PONIES OR JACKASSES COWS EVEN WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES TOTTERING ALONG ON PUNY LEGS OUTSIDE THE TRACES
8797-294123-0020 EVERYBODY WORKED EVERYTHING WORKED I SAW A MAN MENDING THE ROAD I WAS IN CHINA I CAME TO THE CITY OF ANTUNG AND LODGED WITH A MERCHANT HE WAS A GRAIN MERCHANT
8797-294123-0021 CORN HE HAD HUNDREDS OF BUSHELS STORED IN GREAT BINS OF STOUT MATTING PEAS AND BEANS IN SACKS AND IN THE BACK YARD HIS MILLSTONES WENT ROUND AND ROUND GRINDING OUT MEAL ALSO IN HIS BACK YARD WERE BUILDINGS CONTAINING VATS SUNK INTO THE GROUND
8797-294123-0022 AND HERE THE TANNERS WERE AT WORK MAKING LEATHER I BOUGHT A MEASURE OF CORN FROM MINE HOST FOR MY HORSES AND HE OVERCHARGED ME THIRTY CENTS I WAS IN CHINA ANTUNG WAS JAMMED WITH JAPANESE TROOPS
8797-294123-0023 IT WAS THE THICK OF WAR BUT IT DID NOT MATTER THE WORK OF ANTUNG WENT ON JUST THE SAME THE SHOPS WERE WIDE OPEN THE STREETS WERE LINED WITH PEDLARS ONE COULD BUY ANYTHING GET ANYTHING MADE
8797-294123-0024 I DINED AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT CLEANSED MYSELF AT A PUBLIC BATH IN A PRIVATE TUB WITH A SMALL BOY TO ASSIST IN THE SCRUBBING I BOUGHT CONDENSED MILK BITTER CANNED VEGETABLES BREAD AND CAKE I REPEAT IT CAKE GOOD CAKE
8797-294123-0025 I BOUGHT KNIVES FORKS AND SPOONS GRANITE WARE DISHES AND MUGS THERE WERE HORSESHOES AND HORSESHOERS A WORKER IN IRON REALIZED FOR ME NEW DESIGNS OF MINE FOR MY TENT POLES MY SHOES WERE SENT OUT TO BE REPAIRED
8797-294123-0026 A BARBER SHAMPOOED MY HAIR A SERVANT RETURNED WITH CORN BEEF IN TINS A BOTTLE OF PORT ANOTHER OF COGNAC AND BEER
8797-294123-0027 TO WASH OUT FROM MY THROAT THE DUST OF AN ARMY IT WAS THE LAND OF CANAAN I WAS IN CHINA THE KOREAN IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INEFFICIENCY OF UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
8797-294123-0028 THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
8797-294123-0029 LIBERTY TO HIM EPITOMIZES ITSELF IN ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF TOIL TO TILL THE SOIL AND LABOUR INTERMINABLY WITH RUDE IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS IS ALL HE ASKS OF LIFE AND OF THE POWERS THAT BE
8797-294123-0030 WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
8797-294123-0031 HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
8797-294123-0032 HE PREPARES FOR IT ENDURES IT AND SURVIVES IT AND WHEN THE TIDE OF BATTLE SWEEPS BY
8797-294123-0033 HE IS SEEN CALMLY BENDING TO HIS USUAL TASKS NAY WAR ITSELF BEARS FRUITS WHEREOF HE MAY PICK BEFORE THE DEAD ARE COLD OR THE BURIAL SQUADS HAVE ARRIVED HE IS OUT ON THE FIELD
8797-294123-0034 STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
8797-294123-0035 HE DOES NOT HIDE AWAY HIS CHICKENS AND HIS EGGS NOR ANY OTHER COMMODITY HE POSSESSES HE PROCEEDS AT ONCE TO OFFER THEM FOR SALE NOR IS HE TO BE BULLIED INTO LOWERING HIS PRICE
8797-294123-0036 HE HAS TWO LARGE PEARS SAVED OVER FROM LAST YEAR WHICH HE WILL SELL FOR FIVE SEN OR FOR THE SAME PRICE THREE SMALL PEARS WHAT IF ONE SOLDIER PERSIST IN TAKING AWAY WITH HIM THREE LARGE PEARS WHAT IF THERE BE TWENTY OTHER SOLDIERS JOSTLING ABOUT HIM
8797-294123-0037 AND THE SOLDIER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FLIGHT
8797-294123-0038 NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
8797-294123-0039 HIS FORMS CUSTOMS AND METHODS HAVE BEEN PERMANENT THESE MANY CENTURIES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE LEARNED CLASSES AND THAT THESE GOVERNING SCHOLARS FOUND THEIR SALVATION LAY IN SUPPRESSING ALL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS
8797-294123-0040 AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
8797-294123-0041 ON THE OTHER HAND HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED WHEREVER HE HAS ESCAPED BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MAN IS CONCERNED HE HAS GRASPED FAR MORE CLEARLY THE WESTERN CODE OF BUSINESS
8797-294123-0042 THE WESTERN ETHICS OF BUSINESS THAN HAS THE JAPANESE HE HAS LEARNED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO KEEP HIS WORD OR HIS BOND AS YET THE JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN HE HAS SIGNED A TIME CONTRACT
8797-294123-0043 AND WHEN CHANGING CONDITIONS CAUSE HIM TO LOSE BY IT THE JAPANESE MERCHANT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT IT IS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND REPULSIVE TO HIS COMMON SENSE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT AND THEREBY LOSE MONEY
8797-294123-0044 HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ABSOLVE HIM AND IN SO FAR ADAPTABLE AS HE HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
8797-294123-0045 HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
8797-294123-0046 RESOURCES OF COAL AND IRON WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION
8797-294123-0047 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0048 THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
8797-294123-0049 COMES NOW THE JAPANESE ON THE STREETS OF ANTUNG OF FENG WANG CHANG OR OF ANY OTHER MANCHURIAN CITY THE FOLLOWING IS A FAMILIAR SCENE
8797-294123-0050 ON ONE SIDE SQUATS A CHINESE CIVILIAN ON HIS HAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE SQUATS A JAPANESE SOLDIER
8797-294123-0051 THE OTHER NODS UNDERSTANDING SWEEPS THE DUST SLATE LEVEL WITH HIS HAND AND WITH HIS FOREFINGER INSCRIBES SIMILAR CHARACTERS THEY ARE TALKING THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAN WRITE
8797-294123-0052 LONG AGO ONE BORROWED THE OTHER'S WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LONG BEFORE THAT UNTOLD GENERATIONS AGO THEY DIVERGED FROM A COMMON ROOT THE ANCIENT MONGOL STOCK THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES
8797-294123-0053 DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
8797-294123-0054 THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
8797-294123-0055 EQUIPPED WITH THE FINEST MACHINES AND SYSTEMS OF DESTRUCTION THE CAUCASIAN MIND HAS DEVISED HANDLING MACHINES AND SYSTEMS WITH REMARKABLE AND DEADLY ACCURACY THIS REJUVENESCENT JAPANESE RACE HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF CONQUEST THE GOAL OF WHICH NO MAN KNOWS
8797-294123-0056 THE HEAD MEN OF JAPAN ARE DREAMING AMBITIOUSLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE DREAMING BLINDLY A NAPOLEONIC DREAM AND TO THIS DREAM THE JAPANESE CLINGS AND WILL CLING WITH BULL DOG TENACITY THE SOLDIER SHOUTING NIPPON BANZAI
8797-294123-0057 HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
8797-294123-0058 GRANTING THAT THE JAPANESE CAN HURL BACK THE SLAV AND THAT THE TWO GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ANGLO SAXON RACE DO NOT DESPOIL HIM OF HIS SPOILS THE JAPANESE DREAM TAKES ON SUBSTANTIALITY
8797-294123-0059 BUT GIVEN POOR EMPTY KOREA FOR A BREEDING COLONY AND MANCHURIA FOR A GRANARY AND AT ONCE THE JAPANESE BEGINS TO INCREASE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVEN SO HE WOULD NOT OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE A BROWN PERIL
8797-294123-0060 HE HAS NOT THE TIME IN WHICH TO GROW AND REALIZE THE DREAM HE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLIONS AND SO FAST DOES THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PLANET HURRY ON THE PLANET'S PARTITION AMONGST THE WESTERN PEOPLES THAT BEFORE HE COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE REQUISITE TO MENACE
8797-294123-0061 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
8797-294123-0062 THE CHINESE IS NOT DEAD TO NEW IDEAS HE IS AN EFFICIENT WORKER MAKES A GOOD SOLDIER AND IS WEALTHY IN THE ESSENTIAL MATERIALS OF A MACHINE AGE UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT HE WILL GO FAR
8797-294123-0063 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0064 THE BAFFLING ENIGMA OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER IS NO BAFFLING ENIGMA TO HIM HE UNDERSTANDS AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES NOR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE LARGELY THE SAME
8797-294123-0065 HE THINKS WITH THE SAME THOUGHT SYMBOLS AS DOES THE CHINESE AND HE THINKS IN THE SAME PECULIAR GROOVES HE GOES ON WHERE WE ARE BALKED BY THE OBSTACLES OF INCOMPREHENSION HE TAKES THE TURNING WHICH WE CANNOT PERCEIVE
8797-294123-0066 TWISTS AROUND THE OBSTACLE AND PRESTO IS OUT OF SIGHT IN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CHINESE MIND WHERE WE CANNOT FOLLOW THE CHINESE HAS BEEN CALLED THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE AND WELL HE HAS MERITED IT DOZING AS HE HAS THROUGH THE AGES
8797-294123-0067 AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
8797-294123-0068 THE IDEAS OF THE WEST WERE THE LEAVEN WHICH QUICKENED THE JAPANESE AND THE IDEAS OF THE WEST TRANSMITTED BY THE JAPANESE MIND INTO IDEAS JAPANESE MAY WELL MAKE THE LEAVEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO QUICKEN THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0069 WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
8797-294123-0070 MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0071 THE POSSIBILITY OF RACE ADVENTURE HAS NOT PASSED AWAY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR OWN THE SLAV IS JUST GIRDING HIMSELF UP TO BEGIN WHY MAY NOT THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN START OUT ON AN ADVENTURE AS TREMENDOUS AS OUR OWN AND MORE STRIKINGLY UNIQUE
8797-294123-0072 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0073 IT ADVANCES THIS IDEA WITH PERSISTENCY AND DELIVERS ITSELF OF LONG ARGUMENTS SHOWING HOW AND WHY THIS MENACE WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ARISE
8797-294123-0074 THE WESTERN WORLD IS WARNED IF NOT ARMED AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF IT IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE IS A WEAKNESS INHERENT IN THE BROWN MAN WHICH WILL BRING HIS ADVENTURE TO NAUGHT FROM THE WEST HE HAS BORROWED ALL OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT AND PASSED OUR ETHICAL ACHIEVEMENT BY
8797-294123-0075 OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
8797-294123-0076 BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
8797-294123-0077 IT REQUIRED NO REVOLUTION OF HIS NATURE TO LEARN TO CALCULATE THE RANGE AND FIRE A FIELD GUN OR TO MARCH THE GOOSE STEP IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF TRAINING OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR INTELLECT
8797-294123-0078 IT IS KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE IT IS NOT WRAPPED UP IN THE HEREDITY OF THE NEW BORN CHILD BUT IS SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED AFTERWARD
8797-294123-0079 OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
8797-294123-0080 NOR CAN WE WE ARE THUMBED BY THE AGES INTO WHAT WE ARE AND BY NO CONSCIOUS INWARD EFFORT CAN WE IN A DAY RETHUMB OURSELVES NOR CAN THE JAPANESE IN A DAY OR A GENERATION RETHUMB HIMSELF IN OUR IMAGE
8797-294123-0081 BACK OF OUR OWN GREAT RACE ADVENTURE BACK OF OUR ROBBERIES BY SEA AND LAND OUR LUSTS AND VIOLENCES AND ALL THE EVIL THINGS WE HAVE DONE THERE IS A CERTAIN INTEGRITY A STERNNESS OF CONSCIENCE A MELANCHOLY RESPONSIBILITY OF LIFE
8797-294123-0082 A SYMPATHY AND COMRADESHIP AND WARM HUMAN FEEL WHICH IS OURS INDUBITABLY OURS AND WHICH WE CANNOT TEACH TO THE ORIENTAL AS WE WOULD TEACH LOGARITHMS OR THE TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILES
8797-294123-0083 THAT WE HAVE GROPED FOR THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT AND AGONIZED OVER THE SOUL BETOKENS OUR SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT THOUGH WE HAVE STRAYED OFTEN AND FAR FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS THE VOICES OF THE SEERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED
8797-294123-0084 AND WE HAVE HARKED BACK TO THE BIDDING OF CONSCIENCE THE COLOSSAL FACT OF OUR HISTORY IS THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST OUR RELIGION NO MATTER HOW DARK IN ERROR AND DEED OURS HAS BEEN A HISTORY OF SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE AND ENDEAVOUR
8797-294123-0085 WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
8797-294123-0086 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUL WAS HER ANSWER THIS MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE JAPANESE IS WITHOUT SOUL BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SOULS AND THIS WOMAN'S SOUL
8797-294123-0087 THERE WAS NO FEEL NO SPEECH NO RECOGNITION THIS WESTERN SOUL DID NOT DREAM THAT THE EASTERN SOUL EXISTED IT WAS SO DIFFERENT SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGION AS A BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT IN OUR SENSE OF RIGHT
8797-294123-0088 AS A YEARNING AND A STRIFE FOR SPIRITUAL GOOD AND PURITY IS UNKNOWN TO THE JAPANESE MEASURED BY WHAT RELIGION MEANS TO US THE JAPANESE IS A RACE WITHOUT RELIGION YET IT HAS A RELIGION
8797-294123-0089 AS ONE JAPANESE HAS WRITTEN OUR REFLECTION BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH THE MORAL AS THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO US THE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN LAND AND SOIL FROM WHICH TO MINE GOLD OR REAP GRAIN
8797-294123-0090 IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8797-294123-0091 BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
8797-294123-0092 SO FAR AS THE JAPANESE ARE CONCERNED THE EMPEROR LIVES IS HIMSELF DEITY THE EMPEROR IS THE OBJECT TO LIVE FOR AND TO DIE FOR THE JAPANESE IS NOT AN INDIVIDUALIST
8797-294123-0093 HE HAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INSTEAD OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN HIS OWN MORAL WELFARE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE STATE THE HONOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PER SE DOES NOT EXIST
8797-294123-0094 ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
8797-294123-0095 A QUIET SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE A STOIC COMPOSURE IN SIGHT OF DANGER OR CALAMITY A DISDAIN OF LIFE AND FRIENDLINESS WITH DEATH HE RELATES HIMSELF TO THE STATE AS AMONGST BEES THE WORKER IS RELATED TO THE HIVE HIMSELF NOTHING
8797-294123-0096 THE STATE EVERYTHING HIS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE STATE THE MOST ADMIRED QUALITY TO DAY OF THE JAPANESE IS HIS PATRIOTISM
8797-294123-0097 THE WESTERN WORLD IS IN RHAPSODIES OVER IT UNWITTINGLY MEASURING THE JAPANESE PATRIOTISM BY ITS OWN CONCEPTIONS OF PATRIOTISM FOR GOD MY COUNTRY AND THE CZAR CRIES THE RUSSIAN PATRIOT
8797-294123-0098 BUT IN THE JAPANESE MIND THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THREE THE EMPEROR IS THE EMPEROR AND GOD AND COUNTRY AS WELL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE JAPANESE IS BLIND AND UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO WHAT IS PRACTICALLY AN ABSOLUTISM
8797-294123-0099 THE EMPEROR CAN DO NO WRONG NOR CAN THE FIVE AMBITIOUS GREAT MEN WHO HAVE HIS EAR AND CONTROL THE DESTINY OF JAPAN NO GREAT RACE ADVENTURE CAN GO FAR NOR ENDURE LONG WHICH HAS NO DEEPER FOUNDATION THAN MATERIAL SUCCESS
8797-294123-0100 NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
8797-294123-0101 BUT IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ABOVE POSTULATE IS ITSELF A PRODUCT OF WESTERN RACE EGOTISM URGED BY OUR BELIEF IN OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOSTERED BY A FAITH IN OURSELVES WHICH MAY BE AS ERRONEOUS AS ARE MOST FOND RACE FANCIES
8797-294123-0102 SO BE IT THE WORLD IS WHIRLING FASTER TO DAY THAN EVER BEFORE IT HAS GAINED IMPETUS AFFAIRS RUSH TO CONCLUSION THE FAR EAST IS THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THE ADVENTURING WESTERN PEOPLE AS WELL AS OF THE ASIATIC
8797-294123-0103 WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
2182-181173-0000 BUT AT LEAST HE UNDERSTOOD AFTER A FEW CONVERSATIONS WITH MISTER HAVISHAM THAT HE COULD GRATIFY ALL HIS NEAREST WISHES AND HE PROCEEDED TO GRATIFY THEM WITH A SIMPLICITY AND DELIGHT WHICH CAUSED MISTER HAVISHAM MUCH DIVERSION
2182-181173-0001 IN THE WEEK BEFORE THEY SAILED FOR ENGLAND HE DID MANY CURIOUS THINGS THE LAWYER LONG AFTER REMEMBERED THE MORNING THEY WENT DOWN TOWN TOGETHER TO PAY A VISIT TO DICK
2182-181173-0002 AND THE AFTERNOON THEY SO AMAZED THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE BY STOPPING BEFORE HER STALL AND TELLING HER SHE WAS TO HAVE A TENT AND A STOVE AND A SHAWL AND A SUM OF MONEY WHICH SEEMED TO HER QUITE WONDERFUL
2182-181173-0003 SO I THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW PAINFUL A PERSON'S BONES CAN BE BUT I'VE SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU A GREAT DEAL AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE BETTER SHE'S A VERY GOOD APPLE WOMAN HE SAID TO MISTER HAVISHAM AS THEY WALKED AWAY
2182-181173-0004 LEAVING THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE STALL ALMOST GASPING FOR BREATH AND NOT AT ALL BELIEVING IN HER GREAT FORTUNE ONCE WHEN I FELL DOWN AND CUT MY KNEE SHE GAVE ME AN APPLE FOR NOTHING I'VE ALWAYS REMEMBERED HER FOR IT YOU KNOW
2182-181173-0005 YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND TO YOU IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIS HONEST SIMPLE LITTLE MIND THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO COULD FORGET KINDNESSES THE INTERVIEW WITH DICK WAS QUITE EXCITING
2182-181173-0006 DICK HAD JUST BEEN HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH JAKE AND WAS IN LOW SPIRITS WHEN THEY SAW HIM HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN CEDRIC CALMLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD COME TO GIVE HIM WHAT SEEMED A VERY GREAT THING TO HIM AND WOULD SET ALL HIS TROUBLES RIGHT
2182-181173-0007 THE STATEMENT THAT HIS OLD FRIEND HAD BECOME A LORD AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING AN EARL IF HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH CAUSED DICK TO SO OPEN HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND START THAT HIS CAP FELL OFF WHEN HE PICKED IT UP HE UTTERED A RATHER SINGULAR EXCLAMATION
2182-181173-0008 MISTER HOBBS THOUGHT I'D HAD A SUNSTROKE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE IT BETTER NOW I'M USED TO IT THE ONE WHO IS THE EARL NOW HE'S MY GRANDPAPA AND HE WANTS ME TO DO ANYTHING I LIKE
2182-181173-0009 HE'S VERY KIND IF HE IS AN EARL AND HE SENT ME A LOT OF MONEY BY MISTER HAVISHAM AND I'VE BROUGHT SOME TO YOU TO BUY JAKE OUT
2182-181173-0010 AND FOUND HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF THE BUSINESS AND SOME NEW BRUSHES AND A MOST ASTONISHING SIGN AND OUTFIT HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN HIS GOOD LUCK ANY MORE EASILY THAN THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE COULD BELIEVE IN HERS
2182-181173-0011 HE WALKED ABOUT LIKE A BOOT BLACK IN A DREAM HE STARED AT HIS YOUNG BENEFACTOR AND FELT AS IF HE MIGHT WAKE UP AT ANY MOMENT HE SCARCELY SEEMED TO REALIZE ANYTHING UNTIL CEDRIC PUT OUT HIS HAND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BEFORE GOING AWAY
2182-181173-0012 WELL GOOD BYE HE SAID AND THOUGH HE TRIED TO SPEAK STEADILY THERE WAS A LITTLE TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE AND HE WINKED HIS BIG BROWN EYES AND I HOPE TRADE'LL BE GOOD I'M SORRY I'M GOING AWAY TO LEAVE YOU
2182-181173-0013 BUT PERHAPS I SHALL COME BACK AGAIN WHEN I'M AN EARL AND I WISH YOU'D WRITE TO ME BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS GOOD FRIENDS AND IF YOU WRITE TO ME HERE'S WHERE YOU MUST SEND YOUR LETTER AND HE GAVE HIM A SLIP OF PAPER
2182-181173-0014 AND HE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT HE FELT JUST THEN IF HE HAD TRIED PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY HE DIDN'T TRY AND ONLY WINKED HIS EYES AND SWALLOWED A LUMP IN HIS THROAT I WISH YE WASN'T GOIN AWAY HE SAID IN A HUSKY VOICE
2182-181173-0015 THEN HE WINKED HIS EYES AGAIN THEN HE LOOKED AT MISTER HAVISHAM AND TOUCHED HIS CAP THANKY SIR FUR BRINGIN HIM DOWN HERE AN FUR WOT YE'VE DONE HE'S HE'S A QUEER LITTLE FELLER HE ADDED I'VE ALLERS THORT A HEAP OF HIM
2182-181173-0016 HE'S SUCH A GAME LITTLE FELLER AN' AN SUCH A QUEER LITTLE UN AND WHEN THEY TURNED AWAY HE STOOD AND LOOKED AFTER THEM IN A DAZED KIND OF WAY AND THERE WAS STILL A MIST IN HIS EYES AND A LUMP IN HIS THROAT
2182-181173-0017 AS HE WATCHED THE GALLANT LITTLE FIGURE MARCHING GAYLY ALONG BY THE SIDE OF ITS TALL RIGID ESCORT UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE HIS LORDSHIP SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE WITH MISTER HOBBS IN THE STORE
2182-181173-0018 GLOOM HAD SETTLED UPON MISTER HOBBS HE WAS MUCH DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS WHEN HIS YOUNG FRIEND BROUGHT TO HIM IN TRIUMPH THE PARTING GIFT OF A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN MISTER HOBBS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT PROPERLY
2182-181173-0019 HE LAID THE CASE ON HIS STOUT KNEE AND BLEW HIS NOSE VIOLENTLY SEVERAL TIMES THERE'S SOMETHING WRITTEN ON IT SAID CEDRIC INSIDE THE CASE I TOLD THE MAN MYSELF WHAT TO SAY
2182-181173-0020 FROM HIS OLDEST FRIEND LORD FAUNTLEROY TO MISTER HOBBS WHEN THIS YOU SEE REMEMBER ME I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET ME MISTER HOBBS BLEW HIS NOSE VERY LOUDLY AGAIN
2182-181173-0021 I SHA'N'T FORGET YOU HE SAID SPEAKING A TRIFLE HUSKILY AS DICK HAD SPOKEN NOR DON'T YOU GO AND FORGET ME WHEN YOU GET AMONG THE BRITISH ARRYSTOCRACY
2182-181173-0022 I SHOULDN'T FORGET YOU WHOEVER I WAS AMONG ANSWERED HIS LORDSHIP I'VE SPENT MY HAPPIEST HOURS WITH YOU AT LEAST SOME OF MY HAPPIEST HOURS I HOPE YOU'LL COME TO SEE ME SOMETIME
2182-181173-0023 I'D COME TO SEE YOU REPLIED MISTER HOBBS GRACIOUSLY SO IT SEEMED TO BE AGREED THAT IF HE RECEIVED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM THE EARL TO COME AND SPEND A FEW MONTHS AT DORINCOURT CASTLE
2182-181173-0024 WHEN THE CARRIAGE STOOD AT THE DOOR THEN A CURIOUS FEELING OF LONELINESS CAME UPON THE LITTLE BOY HIS MAMMA HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN HER ROOM FOR SOME TIME WHEN SHE CAME DOWN THE STAIRS HER EYES LOOKED LARGE AND WET AND HER SWEET MOUTH WAS TREMBLING
2182-181173-0025 CEDRIC WENT TO HER AND SHE BENT DOWN TO HIM AND HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER HE KNEW SOMETHING MADE THEM BOTH SORRY THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT ONE TENDER LITTLE THOUGHT ROSE TO HIS LIPS
2182-181173-0026 WE LIKED THIS LITTLE HOUSE DEAREST DIDN'T WE HE SAID WE ALWAYS WILL LIKE IT WON'T WE YES YES SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW SWEET VOICE YES DARLING
2182-181173-0027 IT SEEMED ALMOST DIRECTLY THEY WERE ON THE STEAMER IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDEST BUSTLE AND CONFUSION CARRIAGES WERE DRIVING DOWN AND LEAVING PASSENGERS PASSENGERS WERE GETTING INTO A STATE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT BAGGAGE WHICH HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THREATENED TO BE TOO LATE
2182-181173-0028 BIG TRUNKS AND CASES WERE BEING BUMPED DOWN AND DRAGGED ABOUT SAILORS WERE UNCOILING ROPES AND HURRYING TO AND FRO OFFICERS WERE GIVING ORDERS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND CHILDREN AND NURSES WERE COMING ON BOARD
2182-181173-0029 HE LOOKED AT THE PILES OF ROPE AT THE FURLED SAILS AT THE TALL TALL MASTS WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO TOUCH THE HOT BLUE SKY HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS FOR CONVERSING WITH THE SAILORS AND GAINING SOME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PIRATES
2182-181173-0030 IT WAS JUST AT THE VERY LAST WHEN HE WAS STANDING LEANING ON THE RAILING OF THE UPPER DECK AND WATCHING THE FINAL PREPARATIONS ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT AND THE SHOUTS OF THE SAILORS AND WHARFMEN
2182-181173-0031 HE CAME UP TO CEDRIC QUITE BREATHLESS I'VE RUN ALL THE WAY HE SAID I'VE COME DOWN TO SEE YE OFF TRADE'S BEEN PRIME
2182-181173-0032 YE KIN WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS I LOST THE PAPER WHEN I WAS TRYIN TO GET THROUGH THEM FELLERS DOWNSTAIRS
2182-181173-0033 IT'S A HANKERCHER HE POURED IT ALL FORTH AS IF IN ONE SENTENCE A BELL RANG AND HE MADE A LEAP AWAY BEFORE CEDRIC HAD TIME TO SPEAK GOOD BYE HE PANTED WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS AND HE DARTED OFF AND WAS GONE
2182-181173-0034 A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY SAW HIM STRUGGLE THROUGH THE CROWD ON THE LOWER DECK AND RUSH ON SHORE JUST BEFORE THE GANG PLANK WAS DRAWN IN HE STOOD ON THE WHARF AND WAVED HIS CAP CEDRIC HELD THE HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS HAND
2182-181173-0035 IT WAS OF BRIGHT RED SILK ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE HORSESHOES AND HORSES HEADS THERE WAS A GREAT STRAINING AND CREAKING AND CONFUSION THE PEOPLE ON THE WHARF BEGAN TO SHOUT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THE PEOPLE ON THE STEAMER SHOUTED BACK
2182-181173-0036 EVERY ONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING DON'T FORGET US WRITE WHEN YOU GET TO LIVERPOOL GOOD BYE GOOD BYE LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY LEANED FORWARD AND WAVED THE RED HANDKERCHIEF
2182-181173-0037 AND HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE HEARTY CHILDISH VOICE CALLING
2182-181183-0000 OF COURSE AS SOON AS THE STORY OF LORD FAUNTLEROY AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS THEY WERE DISCUSSED IN THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS THE STORY WAS TOO INTERESTING TO BE PASSED OVER LIGHTLY
2182-181183-0001 ONE SAID HE WAS ENGAGED TO A YOUNG LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE ANOTHER SAID HE HAD JUST BEEN MARRIED THE ONLY THING IN FACT WHICH WAS NOT SAID WAS THAT HE WAS A LITTLE BOY BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT
2182-181183-0002 WITH HANDSOME LEGS AND CURLY HAIR ONE SAID HE WAS NO RELATION TO THE EARL OF DORINCOURT AT ALL BUT WAS A SMALL IMPOSTOR WHO HAD SOLD NEWSPAPERS AND SLEPT IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK BEFORE HIS MOTHER IMPOSED UPON THE FAMILY LAWYER
2182-181183-0003 WHO CAME TO AMERICA TO LOOK FOR THE EARL'S HEIR THEN CAME THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW LORD FAUNTLEROY AND HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES SHE WAS A GYPSY SOMETIMES AN ACTRESS SOMETIMES A BEAUTIFUL SPANIARD
2182-181183-0004 BUT IT WAS ALWAYS AGREED THAT THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WAS HER DEADLY ENEMY AND WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HER SON AS HIS HEIR IF HE COULD HELP IT AND AS THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME SLIGHT FLAW IN THE PAPERS SHE HAD PRODUCED
2182-181183-0005 IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LONG TRIAL WHICH WOULD BE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING EVER CARRIED INTO COURT BEFORE MISTER HOBBS USED TO READ THE PAPERS UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL AND IN THE EVENING HE AND DICK WOULD TALK IT ALL OVER
2182-181183-0006 THE MORE EXCITED THEY BECAME SEEMS LIKE SOMETHIN ORTER BE DONE SAID MISTER HOBBS THINGS LIKE THEM ORTER BE HELD ON TO EARLS OR NO EARLS BUT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO
2182-181183-0007 BUT EACH WRITE A LETTER TO CEDRIC CONTAINING ASSURANCES OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY THEY WROTE THOSE LETTERS AS SOON AS THEY COULD AFTER RECEIVING THE NEWS AND AFTER HAVING WRITTEN THEM THEY HANDED THEM OVER TO EACH OTHER TO BE READ
2182-181183-0008 THIS IS WHAT MISTER HOBBS READ IN DICK'S LETTER DERE FREND
2182-181183-0009 AN WE SAY HOLD ON AS LONGS U KIN

2182-181183-0013 SO NO MORE AT PRESENT DICK
2182-181183-0014 I BELIEVE ITS A PUT UP JOB AND THEM THATS DONE IT OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AFTER SHARP AND WHAT I WRITE TO SAY IS TWO THINGS
2182-181183-0015 AND IF THE WORST HAPPENS AND THEM EARLS IS TOO MANY FOR US THERES A PARTNERSHIP IN THE GROCERY BUSINESS READY FOR YOU WHEN YURE OLD ENOUGH AND A HOME AND A FRIEND IN
2182-181183-0016 SILAS HOBBS WELL SAID MISTER HOBBS HE'S PERVIDED FOR BETWEEN US IF HE AINT A EARL SO HE IS SAID DICK I'D HA STOOD BY HIM BLEST IF I DIDN'T LIKE THAT LITTLE FELLER FUST RATE
2182-181183-0017 THE VERY NEXT MORNING ONE OF DICK'S CUSTOMERS WAS RATHER SURPRISED HE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER JUST BEGINNING PRACTICE AS POOR AS A VERY YOUNG LAWYER CAN POSSIBLY BE
2182-181183-0018 BUT A BRIGHT ENERGETIC YOUNG FELLOW WITH SHARP WIT AND A GOOD TEMPER HE HAD A SHABBY OFFICE NEAR DICK'S STAND AND EVERY MORNING DICK BLACKED HIS BOOTS FOR HIM AND QUITE OFTEN THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY WATER TIGHT BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A FRIENDLY WORD OR A JOKE FOR DICK
2182-181183-0019 AND DICK WAS STARING AT ONE OF THEM WITH HIS EYES AND MOUTH OPEN AND HIS SHARP FACE ALMOST PALE WITH EXCITEMENT WHAT'S TO PAY DICK SAID THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HAS PARALYZED YOU DICK REALLY DID LOOK AS IF SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED
2182-181183-0020 MY I KNOW HER BETTER N I KNOW YOU THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH WHERE DID YOU MEET HER DICK HE SAID AT NEWPORT OR WHEN YOU RAN OVER TO PARIS THE LAST TIME DICK ACTUALLY FORGOT TO GRIN
2182-181183-0021 HE BEGAN TO GATHER HIS BRUSHES AND THINGS TOGETHER AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS BUSINESS FOR THE PRESENT NEVER MIND HE SAID I KNOW HER AN I'VE STRUCK WORK FOR THIS MORNIN
2182-181183-0022 MISTER HOBBS COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF HIS SENSES WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTER AND SAW DICK RUSH IN WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND THE BOY WAS OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING SO MUCH OUT OF BREATH IN FACT THAT HE COULD SCARCELY SPEAK
2182-181183-0023 AS HE THREW THE PAPER DOWN ON THE COUNTER HELLO
2182-181183-0024 LOOK AT IT PANTED DICK
2182-181183-0025 THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT SHE AINT NO RISTOCRAT SHE AINT WITH WITHERING SCORN SHE'S NO LORD'S WIFE
2182-181183-0026 THAT'S WHO DONE IT SHE WAS ALLERS UP TO HER TRICKS AN I'LL TELL YER WOT COME TO ME THE MINNIT I SAW HER PICTUR THERE WAS ONE O THEM PAPERS WE SAW HAD A LETTER IN IT THAT SAID SOMETHIN BOUT HER BOY AN IT SAID HE HAD A SCAR ON HIS CHIN
2182-181183-0027 PUT THEM TWO TOGETHER HER N THAT THERE SCAR WHY THAT THERE BOY O HERS AINT NO MORE A LORD THAN I AM IT'S BEN'S BOY THE LITTLE CHAP SHE HIT WHEN SHE LET FLY THAT PLATE AT ME
2182-181183-0028 PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SHARP BOY AND EARNING HIS LIVING IN THE STREETS OF A BIG CITY HAD MADE HIM STILL SHARPER HE HAD LEARNED TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND HIS WITS ABOUT HIM
2182-181183-0029 AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE ENJOYED IMMENSELY THE EXCITEMENT AND IMPATIENCE OF THAT MOMENT IF LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY COULD ONLY HAVE LOOKED INTO THE STORE THAT MORNING HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN INTERESTED
2182-181183-0030 THE FELLER THAT GIVE ME THE PAPER HE'S A LAWYER LET'S AX HIM WHAT WE'D BETTER DO LAWYERS KNOWS IT ALL MISTER HOBBS WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND DICK'S BUSINESS CAPACITY
2182-181183-0031 THAT'S SO HE REPLIED THIS HERE CALLS FOR LAWYERS AND LEAVING THE STORE IN THE CARE OF A SUBSTITUTE HE STRUGGLED INTO HIS COAT AND MARCHED DOWN TOWN WITH DICK AND THE TWO PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR ROMANTIC STORY IN MISTER HARRISON'S OFFICE
2182-181183-0032 MUCH TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S ASTONISHMENT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN A VERY YOUNG LAWYER WITH A VERY ENTERPRISING MIND AND A GREAT DEAL OF SPARE TIME ON HIS HANDS HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO READILY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
2182-181183-0033 FOR IT ALL CERTAINLY SOUNDED VERY WILD AND QUEER BUT HE CHANCED TO WANT SOMETHING TO DO VERY MUCH AND HE CHANCED TO KNOW DICK AND DICK CHANCED TO SAY HIS SAY IN A VERY SHARP TELLING SORT OF WAY
2182-181183-0034 IT APPEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DUBIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHILD THE WOMAN CONTRADICTED HERSELF IN SOME OF HER STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS AGE AND AROUSED SUSPICION THE FIRST PERSONS TO BE WRITTEN TO ARE DICK'S BROTHER AND THE EARL OF DORINCOURT'S FAMILY LAWYER
2182-181183-0035 AND ACTUALLY BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN TWO LETTERS HAD BEEN WRITTEN AND SENT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ONE SPEEDING OUT OF NEW YORK HARBOR ON A MAIL STEAMER ON ITS WAY TO ENGLAND AND THE OTHER ON A TRAIN CARRYING LETTERS AND PASSENGERS BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA
2182-181183-0036 AND THE SECOND TO BENJAMIN TIPTON
625-132118-0000 OF THE PASSING OF THE FIRST BORN
625-132118-0001 THOU HAST FORGOTTEN O SUMMER SWALLOW BUT THE WORLD SHALL END WHEN I FORGET SWINBURNE
625-132118-0002 SANG THE BIT OF YELLOW PAPER THAT FLUTTERED INTO MY ROOM ONE BROWN OCTOBER MORNING THEN THE FEAR OF FATHERHOOD MINGLED WILDLY WITH THE JOY OF CREATION I WONDERED HOW IT LOOKED
625-132118-0003 WHILE I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY WANDERING I FLED TO MY WIFE AND CHILD REPEATING THE WHILE TO MYSELF HALF WONDERINGLY WIFE AND CHILD WIFE AND CHILD
625-132118-0004 FLED FAST AND FASTER THAN BOAT AND STEAM CAR AND YET MUST EVER IMPATIENTLY AWAIT THEM AWAY FROM THE HARD VOICED CITY
625-132118-0005 INTO MY OWN BERKSHIRE HILLS THAT SIT ALL SADLY GUARDING THE GATES OF MASSACHUSETTS UP THE STAIRS I RAN TO THE WAN MOTHER AND WHIMPERING BABE TO THE SANCTUARY ON WHOSE ALTAR A LIFE AT MY BIDDING
625-132118-0006 HAD OFFERED ITSELF TO WIN A LIFE AND WON WHAT IS THIS TINY FORMLESS THING THIS NEWBORN WAIL FROM AN UNKNOWN WORLD ALL HEAD AND VOICE
625-132118-0007 I HANDLE IT CURIOUSLY AND WATCH PERPLEXED ITS WINKING BREATHING AND SNEEZING I DID NOT LOVE IT THEN IT SEEMED A LUDICROUS THING TO LOVE BUT HER I LOVED
625-132118-0008 MY GIRL MOTHER SHE WHOM NOW I SAW UNFOLDING LIKE THE GLORY OF THE MORNING THE TRANSFIGURED WOMAN THROUGH HER I CAME TO LOVE THE WEE THING AS IT GREW STRONG
625-132118-0009 AS ITS LITTLE SOUL UNFOLDED ITSELF IN TWITTER AND CRY AND HALF FORMED WORD AND AS ITS EYES CAUGHT THE GLEAM AND FLASH OF LIFE HOW BEAUTIFUL HE WAS
625-132118-0010 HELD HIM AND GLANCED AT THE HOT RED SOIL OF GEORGIA AND THE BREATHLESS CITY OF A HUNDRED HILLS AND FELT A VAGUE UNREST WHY WAS HIS HAIR
625-132118-0011 I SAW AS IT FELL ACROSS MY BABY THE SHADOW OF THE VEIL WITHIN THE VEIL WAS HE BORN SAID I AND THERE WITHIN SHALL HE LIVE A NEGRO AND A NEGRO'S SON
625-132118-0012 BITTERLY HE UNBOWED PRIDE OF A HUNTED RACE CLINGING WITH THAT TINY DIMPLED HAND AH WEARILY TO A HOPE NOT HOPELESS BUT UNHOPEFUL
625-132118-0013 AND SEEING WITH THOSE BRIGHT WONDERING EYES THAT PEER INTO MY SOUL A LAND WHOSE FREEDOM IS TO US A MOCKERY AND WHOSE LIBERTY A LIE
625-132118-0014 I SAW THE SHADOW OF THE VEIL AS IT PASSED OVER MY BABY I SAW THE COLD CITY TOWERING ABOVE THE BLOOD RED LAND I HELD MY FACE BESIDE HIS LITTLE CHEEK
625-132118-0015 SHOWED HIM THE STAR CHILDREN AND THE TWINKLING LIGHTS AS THEY BEGAN TO FLASH AND STILLED WITH AN EVEN SONG THE UNVOICED TERROR OF MY LIFE SO STURDY AND MASTERFUL HE GREW SO FILLED WITH BUBBLING LIFE
625-132118-0016 HE TINGED HER EVERY DREAM AND IDEALIZED HER EVERY EFFORT NO HANDS BUT HERS MUST TOUCH AND GARNISH THOSE LITTLE LIMBS NO DRESS OR FRILL MUST TOUCH THEM THAT HAD NOT WEARIED HER FINGERS
625-132118-0017 NO VOICE BUT HERS COULD COAX HIM OFF TO DREAMLAND AND SHE AND HE TOGETHER SPOKE SOME SOFT AND UNKNOWN TONGUE AND IN IT HELD COMMUNION I TOO MUSED ABOVE HIS LITTLE WHITE BED
625-132118-0018 THROUGH THE NEWER STRENGTH OF HIS SAW THE DREAM OF MY BLACK FATHERS STAGGER A STEP ONWARD IN THE WILD PHANTASM OF THE WORLD HEARD IN HIS BABY VOICE THE VOICE OF THE PROPHET
625-132118-0019 THAT WAS TO RISE WITHIN THE VEIL AND SO WE DREAMED AND LOVED AND PLANNED BY FALL AND WINTER AND THE FULL FLUSH OF THE LONG SOUTHERN SPRING
625-132118-0020 TILL THE HOT WINDS ROLLED FROM THE FETID GULF TILL THE ROSES SHIVERED AND THE STILL STERN SUN QUIVERED ITS AWFUL LIGHT OVER THE HILLS OF ATLANTA AND THEN ONE NIGHT THE LITTLE FEET PATTERED WEARILY TO THE WEE WHITE BED
625-132118-0021 AND THE TINY HANDS TREMBLED AND A WARM FLUSHED FACE TOSSED ON THE PILLOW AND WE KNEW BABY WAS SICK TEN DAYS HE LAY THERE A SWIFT WEEK
625-132118-0022 OUT INTO THE STARLIGHT I CREPT TO ROUSE THE GRAY PHYSICIAN THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE HOURS TREMBLED ON THE NIGHT LISTENED
625-132118-0023 AND THEN HIS LITTLE SOUL LEAPT LIKE A STAR THAT TRAVELS IN THE NIGHT AND LEFT A WORLD OF DARKNESS IN ITS TRAIN THE DAY CHANGED NOT
625-132118-0024 THE SAME TALL TREES PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOWS THE SAME GREEN GRASS GLINTED IN THE SETTING SUN ONLY IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH WRITHED THE WORLD'S MOST PITEOUS THING A CHILDLESS MOTHER
625-132118-0025 I SHIRK NOT I LONG FOR WORK I PANT FOR A LIFE FULL OF STRIVING I AM NO COWARD TO SHRINK BEFORE THE RUGGED RUSH OF THE STORM NOR EVEN QUAIL BEFORE THE AWFUL SHADOW OF THE VEIL BUT HEARKEN O DEATH

625-132118-0029 AND THE CHILDREN HOVERED AND FLUTTERED ABOUT HIM I CAN SEE HIM NOW CHANGING LIKE THE SKY FROM SPARKLING LAUGHTER TO DARKENING FROWNS AND THEN TO WONDERING THOUGHTFULNESS AS HE WATCHED THE WORLD
625-132118-0030 HE KNEW NO COLOR LINE POOR DEAR AND THE VEIL THOUGH IT SHADOWED HIM HAD NOT YET DARKENED HALF HIS SUN HE LOVED THE WHITE MATRON HE LOVED HIS BLACK NURSE
625-132118-0031 AND IN HIS LITTLE WORLD WALKED SOULS ALONE UNCOLORED AND UNCLOTHED I YEA ALL MEN ARE LARGER AND PURER BY THE INFINITE BREADTH OF THAT ONE LITTLE LIFE
625-132118-0032 SHE WHO IN SIMPLE CLEARNESS OF VISION SEES BEYOND THE STARS SAID WHEN HE HAD FLOWN HE WILL BE HAPPY THERE HE EVER LOVED BEAUTIFUL THINGS
625-132118-0033 AND I FAR MORE IGNORANT AND BLIND BY THE WEB OF MINE OWN WEAVING SIT ALONE WINDING WORDS AND MUTTERING IF STILL HE BE AND HE BE THERE AND THERE BE A THERE
625-132118-0034 LET HIM BE HAPPY O FATE BLITHE WAS THE MORNING OF HIS BURIAL WITH BIRD AND SONG AND SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS THE TREES WHISPERED TO THE GRASS
625-132118-0035 THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THOSE PALE FACED HURRYING MEN AND WOMEN THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THEY ONLY GLANCED AND SAID NIGGERS
625-132118-0036 IN VAIN FOR WHERE O GOD BENEATH THY BROAD BLUE SKY SHALL MY DARK BABY REST IN PEACE WHERE REVERENCE DWELLS AND GOODNESS AND A FREEDOM THAT IS FREE
625-132118-0037 ALL THAT DAY AND ALL THAT NIGHT THERE SAT AN AWFUL GLADNESS IN MY HEART NAY BLAME ME NOT IF I SEE THE WORLD THUS DARKLY THROUGH THE VEIL AND MY SOUL WHISPERS EVER TO ME SAYING NOT DEAD
625-132118-0038 NO TAUNT SHALL MADDEN HIS HAPPY BOYHOOD FOOL THAT I WAS TO THINK OR WISH THAT THIS LITTLE SOUL SHOULD GROW CHOKED AND DEFORMED WITHIN THE VEIL I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT YONDER DEEP
625-132118-0039 WHICH HIS FATHER HAD HARDLY CRUSHED IN HIS OWN HEART FOR WHAT FORSOOTH SHALL A NEGRO WANT WITH PRIDE AMID THE STUDIED HUMILIATIONS OF FIFTY MILLION FELLOWS WELL SPED MY BOY
625-132118-0040 BEFORE THE WORLD HAD DUBBED YOUR AMBITION INSOLENCE HAD HELD YOUR IDEALS UNATTAINABLE AND TAUGHT YOU TO CRINGE AND BOW
625-132118-0041 BETTER FAR THIS NAMELESS VOID THAT STOPS MY LIFE THAN A SEA OF SORROW FOR YOU IDLE WORDS
625-132118-0042 AYE AND FOUND IT LIGHTER TOO SOME DAY FOR SURELY SURELY THIS IS NOT THE END
625-132118-0043 SURELY THERE SHALL YET DAWN SOME MIGHTY MORNING TO LIFT THE VEIL AND SET THE PRISONED FREE NOT FOR ME I SHALL DIE IN MY BONDS BUT FOR FRESH YOUNG SOULS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NIGHT
625-132118-0044 AND WAKEN TO THE MORNING A MORNING WHEN MEN ASK OF THE WORKMAN NOT IS HE WHITE BUT CAN HE WORK WHEN MEN ASK ARTISTS NOT ARE THEY BLACK BUT DO THEY KNOW
625-132118-0045 SOME MORNING THIS MAY BE LONG LONG YEARS TO COME BUT NOW THERE WAILS ON THAT DARK SHORE WITHIN THE VEIL THE SAME DEEP VOICE THOU SHALT FOREGO
625-132118-0046 AND ALL HAVE I FOREGONE AT THAT COMMAND AND WITH SMALL COMPLAINT ALL SAVE THAT FAIR YOUNG FORM THAT LIES SO COLDLY WED WITH DEATH
625-132118-0047 IN THE NEST I HAD BUILDED IF ONE MUST HAVE GONE WHY NOT I WHY MAY I NOT REST ME FROM THIS RESTLESSNESS AND SLEEP FROM THIS WIDE WAKING
625-132118-0048 WAS NOT THE WORLD'S ALEMBIC TIME IN HIS YOUNG HANDS AND IS NOT MY TIME WANING ARE THERE SO MANY WORKERS IN THE VINEYARD THAT THE FAIR PROMISE OF THIS LITTLE BODY
625-132118-0049 COULD LIGHTLY BE TOSSED AWAY THE WRETCHED OF MY RACE THAT LINE THE ALLEYS OF THE NATION SIT FATHERLESS AND UNMOTHERED
625-132118-0050 SLEEP THEN CHILD SLEEP TILL I SLEEP AND WAKEN TO A BABY VOICE AND THE CEASELESS PATTER OF LITTLE FEET
6454-93938-0000 WHAT SEEMED AT THE MOMENT AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE PUZZLE HAD AS WE AFTERWARDS LEARNED A VERY SIMPLE EXPLANATION ONE OF THE G S DIRECTORS MISTER BALDWIN WHO HAD COME IN ON MISTER CAMP'S CAR
6454-93938-0001 SEEING THROUGH THE DEVICE THE PARTY HAD AT ONCE GONE TO THIS RANCH WHERE THE OWNER BALDWIN MOUNTED THEM AND IT WAS THEIR DUST CLOUD WE HAD SEEN AS THEY RODE UP TO ASH FORKS
6454-93938-0002 TO MAKE MATTERS MORE SERIOUS BALDWIN HAD ROUNDED UP HIS COWBOYS AND BROUGHT THEM ALONG WITH HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY RESISTANCE IMPOSSIBLE I MADE NO OBJECTION TO THE SHERIFF SERVING THE PAPER
6454-93938-0003 AND THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES ARE AGAINST SISERA WITH THE SHERIFF AND MISTER CAMP I THEN WALKED OVER TO THE SALOON WHERE JUDGE WILSON WAS WAITING TO DISPOSE OF MY CASE
6454-93938-0004 AND ANSWERED THAT I ASKED AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE CASE SO THAT I MIGHT BE HEARD BY COUNSEL IT WAS DENIED AS WAS TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTED INDEED WHY THEY TOOK THE TROUBLE TO GO THROUGH THE FORMS WAS BEYOND ME
6454-93938-0005 I TOLD WILSON I SHOULD NOT PRODUCE THE LETTERS AND HE ASKED IF I KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING AND RETORTING IT VERY APPROPRIATELY MEANS CONTEMPT OF THE COURT YOUR HONOR
6454-93938-0006 SEEING THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE MOVES TOO WELL TO BE BLUFFED THE JUDGE MISTER CAMP AND THE LAWYER HELD A WHISPERED CONSULTATION MY SURPRISE CAN BE IMAGINED WHEN AT ITS CONCLUSION MISTER CAMP SAID
6454-93938-0007 ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER FOURTEENTH AND ASK THAT HE BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON THAT CHARGE I COULDN'T MAKE OUT THIS NEW MOVE AND PUZZLED OVER IT WHILE JUDGE WILSON ORDERED MY COMMITMENT
6454-93938-0008 BUT THE NEXT STEP REVEALED THE OBJECT FOR THE LAWYER THEN ASKED FOR A SEARCH WARRANT TO LOOK FOR STOLEN PROPERTY THE JUDGE WAS EQUALLY OBLIGING AND BEGAN TO FILL ONE OUT ON THE INSTANT
6454-93938-0009 THIS MADE ME FEEL PRETTY SERIOUS FOR THE LETTERS WERE IN MY BREAST POCKET AND I SWORE AT MY OWN STUPIDITY IN NOT HAVING PUT THEM IN THE STATION SAFE WHEN I HAD FIRST ARRIVED AT ASH FORKS
6454-93938-0010 THERE WEREN'T MANY MOMENTS IN WHICH TO THINK WHILE THE JUDGE SCRIBBLED AWAY AT THE WARRANT BUT IN WHAT TIME THERE WAS I DID A LOT OF HEAD WORK WITHOUT HOWEVER FINDING MORE THAN ONE WAY OUT OF THE SNARL
6454-93938-0011 AND WHEN I SAW THE JUDGE FINISH OFF HIS SIGNATURE WITH A FLOURISH I PLAYED A PRETTY DESPERATE CARD YOU'RE JUST TOO LATE GENTLEMEN I SAID POINTING OUT THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE SALOON THERE COME THE CAVALRY
6454-93938-0012 THE THREE CONSPIRATORS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND BOLTED FOR THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0013 AS HE DID SO I GAVE HIM A SHOVE TOWARDS THE THREE WHICH SENT THEM ALL SPRAWLING ON THE FLOOR IN A PRETTY BADLY MIXED UP CONDITION I MADE A DASH FOR THE DOOR AND AS I WENT THROUGH IT
6454-93938-0014 I GRABBED THE KEY AND LOCKED THEM IN WHEN I TURNED TO DO SO I SAW THE LOT STRUGGLING UP FROM THE FLOOR AND KNOWING THAT IT WOULDN'T TAKE THEM MANY SECONDS TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0015 AS ONLY WESTERN HORSES WILL STAND IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO HAVE THOSE BRIDLES BACK IN PLACE AND AS I TOSSED EACH OVER THE PEAK OF THE MEXICAN SADDLE
6454-93938-0016 I GAVE TWO OF THE PONIES SLAPS WHICH STARTED THEM OFF AT A LOPE ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS I SWUNG MYSELF INTO THE SADDLE OF THE THIRD AND FLICKED HIM WITH THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE BRIDLE IN A WAY WHICH MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I MEANT BUSINESS
6454-93938-0017 AND CONSIDERING THAT HE HAD COVERED OVER FORTY MILES THAT AFTERNOON IN PRETTY QUICK TIME IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH GO LEFT IN HIM
6454-93938-0018 TWO HUNDRED FEET THEREFORE BROUGHT ME TO THE EDGE OF THE TOWN AND I WHEELED MY PONY AND RODE DOWN BEHIND THE REAR OF THE BUILDINGS IN TURNING I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HALF A DOZEN MOUNTED MEN ALREADY IN PURSUIT
6454-93938-0019 BUT I LOST SIGHT OF THEM THE NEXT MOMENT AS SOON AS I REACHED A STREET LEADING BACK TO THE RAILROAD I TURNED AGAIN AND RODE TOWARDS IT MY ONE THOUGHT BEING TO GET BACK IF POSSIBLE TO THE STATION
6454-93938-0020 AND PUT THE LETTERS INTO THE RAILROAD AGENT'S SAFE WHEN I REACHED THE MAIN STREET I SAW THAT MY HOPE WAS FUTILE FOR ANOTHER BATCH OF COWBOYS WERE COMING IN FULL GALLOP TOWARDS ME VERY THOROUGHLY HEADING ME OFF IN THAT DIRECTION
6454-93938-0021 TO ESCAPE THEM I HEADED UP THE STREET AWAY FROM THE STATION WITH THE PACK IN CLOSE PURSUIT THEY YELLED AT ME TO HOLD UP AND I EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO HEAR THE CRACK OF REVOLVERS
6454-93938-0022 IN EXPECTATION OF HEARING THE SHOOTING BEGIN AND TO KNOW THAT ANY MOMENT MAY BE YOUR LAST I DON'T SUPPOSE I WAS ON THE RAGGED EDGE MORE THAN THIRTY SECONDS BUT THEY WERE ENOUGH TO PROVE TO ME THAT
6454-93938-0023 TO KEEP ONE'S BACK TURNED TO AN ENEMY AS ONE RUNS AWAY TAKES A DEAL MORE PLUCK THAN TO STAND UP AND FACE HIS GUN FORTUNATELY FOR ME MY PURSUERS FELT SO SURE OF MY CAPTURE
6454-93938-0024 THAT NOT ONE OF THEM DREW A BEAD ON ME THE MOMENT I SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE I PUT MY HAND IN MY BREAST POCKET AND TOOK OUT THE LETTERS INTENDING TO TEAR THEM INTO A HUNDRED PIECES BUT
6454-93938-0025 AS I DID SO I REALIZED THAT TO DESTROY UNITED STATES MAIL NOT MERELY ENTAILED CRIMINAL LIABILITY BUT WAS OFF COLOR MORALLY I FALTERED
6454-93938-0026 BALANCING THE OUTWITTING OF CAMP AGAINST STATE'S PRISON THE DOING MY BEST FOR MADGE AGAINST THE WRONG OF IT I THINK I'M AS HONEST A FELLOW AS THE AVERAGE BUT I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I COULDN'T DECIDE TO DO RIGHT
6454-93938-0027 TILL I THOUGHT THAT MADGE WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BE DISHONEST EVEN FOR HER I TURNED ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND CUT IN BEHIND SOME FREIGHT CARS THAT WERE STANDING ON A SIDING
6454-93938-0028 THIS PUT ME OUT OF VIEW OF MY PURSUERS FOR A MOMENT AND IN THAT INSTANT I STOOD UP IN MY STIRRUPS LIFTED THE BROAD LEATHER FLAP OF THE SADDLE AND TUCKED THE LETTERS UNDERNEATH IT AS FAR IN AS I COULD FORCE THEM
6454-93938-0029 IT WAS A DESPERATE PLACE IN WHICH TO HIDE THEM BUT THE GAME WAS A DESPERATE ONE AT BEST AND THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE IDEA MIGHT BE ITS BEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS
6454-93938-0030 I WAS NOW HEADING FOR THE STATION OVER THE TIES AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE FRED CULLEN WITH LORD RALLES ON THE TRACKS UP BY THE SPECIAL FOR MY MIND HAD BEEN SO BUSY IN THE LAST HOUR
6454-93938-0031 THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT FRED WAS DUE THE MOMENT I SAW HIM I RODE TOWARDS HIM PRESSING MY PONY FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH MY HOPE WAS THAT I MIGHT GET TIME TO GIVE FRED THE TIP AS TO WHERE THE LETTERS WERE
6454-93938-0032 BUT BEFORE I WAS WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE BALDWIN CAME RUNNING OUT FROM BEHIND THE STATION AND SEEING ME TURNED CALLED BACK AND GESTICULATED EVIDENTLY TO SUMMON SOME COWBOYS TO HEAD ME OFF
6454-93938-0033 AFRAID TO SHOUT ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD CONVEY THE SLIGHTEST CLUE AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE LETTERS AS THE NEXT BEST THING I PULLED A COUPLE OF OLD SECTION REPORTS FROM MY POCKET
6454-93938-0034 INTENDING TO RIDE UP AND RUN INTO MY CAR FOR I KNEW THAT THE PAPERS IN MY HAND WOULD BE TAKEN TO BE THE WANTED LETTERS AND THAT IF I COULD ONLY GET INSIDE THE CAR EVEN FOR A MOMENT THE SUSPICION WOULD BE THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO HIDE THEM
6454-93938-0035 HIDE THEM FRED WAS QUICK AS A FLASH AND GRABBING THEM OFF THE GROUND SPRANG UP THE STEPS OF MY CAR AND RAN INSIDE JUST ESCAPING A BULLET FROM MY PURSUERS
6454-120342-0000 OURS ARE NOT THE CAROLLINGS OF YOUR POOR SHIVERING LITTLE EAST ANGLES OR SOUTH MERCIANS WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLOD ROUND AFOOT IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SLEIGH RIDE IS
6454-120342-0001 I HAD ASKED HARRY TO HAVE SIXTEEN OF THE BEST VOICES IN THE CHAPEL SCHOOL TO BE TRAINED TO EIGHT OR TEN GOOD CAROLS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY WE DID NOT CARE TO DISAPPOINT THEM IF A FEBRUARY THAW SETTING IN ON THE TWENTY FOURTH OF DECEMBER
6454-120342-0002 SHOULD BREAK UP THE SPREE BEFORE IT BEGAN THEN I HAD TOLD HOWLAND THAT HE MUST RESERVE FOR ME A SPAN OF GOOD HORSES AND A SLEIGH THAT I COULD PACK SIXTEEN SMALL CHILDREN INTO TIGHT STOWED
6454-120342-0003 HOWLAND IS ALWAYS GOOD ABOUT SUCH THINGS KNEW WHAT THE SLEIGH WAS FOR HAVING DONE THE SAME IN OTHER YEARS AND DOUBLED THE SPAN OF HORSES OF HIS OWN ACCORD BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT BETTER AND IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
6454-120342-0004 SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE WEATHER NYMPHS ORDERED THE WIND HAULED ROUND TO THE NORTHWEST AND EVERYTHING FROZE HARD MONDAY NIGHT THINGS MODERATED AND THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL STEADILY SO STEADILY
6454-120342-0005 AND SO TUESDAY NIGHT THE METROPOLITAN PEOPLE GAVE UP THEIR UNEQUAL CONTEST ALL GOOD MEN AND ANGELS REJOICING AT THEIR DISCOMFITURE AND ONLY A FEW OF THE PEOPLE IN THE VERY LOWEST BOLGIE BEING ILL NATURED ENOUGH TO GRIEVE
6454-120342-0006 AND WITHOUT FATIGUE TO HORSE OR MAN SO IT WAS THAT WHEN I CAME DOWN WITH LYCIDAS TO THE CHAPEL AT SEVEN O'CLOCK I FOUND HARRY HAD GATHERED THERE HIS EIGHT PRETTY GIRLS AND HIS EIGHT JOLLY BOYS
6454-120342-0007 AND HAD THEM PRACTISING FOR THE LAST TIME CAROL CAROL CHRISTIANS CAROL JOYFULLY CAROL FOR THE COMING OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY I THINK THE CHILDREN HAD GOT INKLING OF WHAT WAS COMING
6454-120342-0008 OR PERHAPS HARRY HAD HINTED IT TO THEIR MOTHERS CERTAINLY THEY WERE WARMLY DRESSED AND WHEN FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS HOWLAND CAME ROUND HIMSELF WITH THE SLEIGH HE HAD PUT IN AS MANY RUGS AND BEAR SKINS
6454-120342-0009 AS IF HE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN WERE TO BE TAKEN NEW BORN FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE CRADLES GREAT WAS THE REJOICING AS THE BELLS OF THE HORSES RANG BENEATH THE CHAPEL WINDOWS AND HARRY DID NOT GET HIS LAST DA CAPO FOR HIS LAST CAROL
6454-120342-0010 UNDER THE FULL MOON ON THE SNOW STILL WHITE WITH SIXTEEN CHILDREN AT THE HAPPIEST
6454-120342-0011 THERE CAN BE NOTHING BETTER THAN TWO OR THREE SUCH HOURS FIRST DRIVER OUT ON COMMONWEALTH AVENUE THAT WILL TONE DOWN THE HORSES STOP ON THE LEFT AFTER YOU HAVE PASSED FAIRFIELD STREET
6454-120342-0012 SO WE DASHED UP TO THE FRONT OF HALIBURTON'S PALACE WHERE HE WAS KEEPING HIS FIRST CHRISTMAS TIDE AND THE CHILDREN WHOM HARRY HAD HUSHED DOWN FOR A SQUARE OR TWO BROKE FORTH WITH GOOD FULL VOICE UNDER HIS STRONG LEAD IN
6454-120342-0013 SHEPHERD OF TENDER SHEEP SINGING WITH ALL THAT UNCONSCIOUS PATHOS WITH WHICH CHILDREN DO SING AND STARTING THE TEARS IN YOUR EYES IN THE MIDST OF YOUR GLADNESS THE INSTANT THE HORSES BELLS STOPPED THEIR VOICES BEGAN
6454-120342-0014 IN AN INSTANT MORE WE SAW HALIBURTON AND ANNA RUN TO THE WINDOW AND PULL UP THE SHADES AND IN A MINUTE MORE FACES AT ALL THE WINDOWS AND SO THE CHILDREN SUNG THROUGH CLEMENT'S OLD HYMN
6454-120342-0015 LITTLE DID CLEMENT THINK OF BELLS AND SNOW AS HE TAUGHT IT IN HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL THERE IN ALEXANDRIA BUT PERHAPS TO DAY AS THEY PIN UP THE LAURELS AND THE PALM IN THE CHAPEL AT ALEXANDRIA
6454-120342-0016 THEY ARE HUMMING THE WORDS NOT THINKING OF CLEMENT MORE THAN HE THOUGHT OF US AS THE CHILDREN CLOSED WITH
6454-120342-0017 HALIBURTON CAME RUNNING OUT AND BEGGED ME TO BRING THEM IN BUT I TOLD HIM NO AS SOON AS I COULD HUSH THEIR SHOUTS OF MERRY CHRISTMAS THAT WE HAD A LONG JOURNEY BEFORE US AND MUST NOT ALIGHT BY THE WAY
6454-120342-0018 AND THE CHILDREN BROKE OUT WITH HAIL TO THE NIGHT HAIL TO THE DAY RATHER A FAVORITE QUICKER AND MORE TO THE CHILDISH TASTE PERHAPS THAN THE OTHER AND WITH ANOTHER MERRY CHRISTMAS WE WERE OFF AGAIN
6454-120342-0019 WE RAN THE SLEIGH INTO A BANK ON THE SLOPE OF PINCKNEY STREET IN FRONT OF WALTER'S HOUSE AND BEFORE THEY SUSPECTED THERE THAT ANY ONE HAD COME THE CHILDREN WERE SINGING CAROL CAROL CHRISTIANS CAROL JOYFULLY
6454-120342-0020 KISSES FLUNG FROM THE WINDOW KISSES FLUNG BACK FROM THE STREET MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN WITH A GOOD WILL AND THEN ONE OF THE GIRLS BEGAN WHEN ANNA TOOK THE BABY AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO HERS
6454-120342-0021 AND ALL OF THEM FELL IN SO CHEERILY O DEAR ME IT IS A SCRAP OF OLD EPHREM THE SYRIAN IF THEY DID BUT KNOW IT AND WHEN AFTER THIS HARRY WOULD FAIN HAVE DRIVEN ON
6454-120342-0022 BECAUSE TWO CAROLS AT ONE HOUSE WAS THE RULE HOW THE LITTLE WITCHES BEGGED THAT THEY MIGHT SING JUST ONE SONG MORE THERE BECAUSE MISSUS ALEXANDER HAD BEEN SO KIND TO THEM WHEN SHE SHOWED THEM ABOUT THE GERMAN STITCHES
6454-120342-0023 AND THEN UP THE HILL AND OVER TO THE NORTH END AND AS FAR AS WE COULD GET THE HORSES UP INTO MOON COURT THAT THEY MIGHT SING TO THE ITALIAN IMAGE MAN WHO GAVE LUCY THE BOY AND DOG IN PLASTER
6454-120342-0024 THOUGH CHRYSOSTOM SHOULD HAVE MADE A FEW REMARKS TO THEM SEVENTEEN TIMES IN THE CHAPEL THEN THE ITALIAN IMAGE MAN HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE NOW IS THE TIME OF CHRISTMAS COME AND
6454-120342-0025 JESUS IN HIS BABES ABIDING AND THEN WE CAME UP HANOVER STREET AND STOPPED UNDER MISTER GERRY'S CHAPEL WHERE THEY WERE DRESSING THE WALLS WITH THEIR EVERGREENS AND GAVE THEM HAIL TO THE NIGHT HAIL TO THE DAY
6454-120342-0026 AND SO DOWN STATE STREET AND STOPPED AT THE ADVERTISER OFFICE BECAUSE WHEN THE BOYS GAVE THEIR LITERARY ENTERTAINMENT MISTER HALE PUT IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT FOR NOTHING AND UP IN THE OLD ATTIC THERE
6454-120342-0027 AND THE IN GENERAL MAN FROM HIS MORE SERIOUS VIEWS AND THE DAILY THE NEXT MORNING WISHED EVERYBODY A MERRY CHRISTMAS WITH EVEN MORE UNCTION AND RESOLVED THAT IN COMING YEARS IT WOULD HAVE A SUPPLEMENT
6454-120342-0028 LARGE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN ALL THE GOOD WISHES SO AWAY AGAIN TO THE HOUSES OF CONFECTIONERS WHO HAD GIVEN THE CHILDREN CANDY
6454-120342-0029 TO THE PALACES OF MILLIONNAIRES WHO HAD PRAYED FOR THESE CHILDREN WITH TEARS IF THE CHILDREN ONLY KNEW IT TO DOCTOR FROTHINGHAM'S IN SUMMER STREET I REMEMBER WHERE WE STOPPED BECAUSE THE BOSTON ASSOCIATION OF MINISTERS MET THERE
6454-120342-0030 AND OUT ON DOVER STREET BRIDGE THAT THE POOR CHAIR MENDER MIGHT HEAR OUR CAROLS SUNG ONCE MORE BEFORE HE HEARD THEM BETTER SUNG IN ANOTHER WORLD WHERE NOTHING NEEDS MENDING
6454-120342-0031 KING OF GLORY KING OF PEACE HEAR THE SONG AND SEE THE STAR WELCOME BE THOU HEAVENLY KING
6454-120342-0032 AND ALL THE OTHERS RUNG OUT WITH ORDER OR WITHOUT ORDER BREAKING THE HUSH DIRECTLY AS THE HORSES BELLS WERE STILLED THROWN INTO THE AIR WITH ALL THE GLADNESS OF CHILDHOOD
6454-120342-0033 EVERYWHERE A LITTLE CROWD GATHERED ROUND US AND THEN WE DASHED AWAY FAR ENOUGH TO GATHER QUITE ANOTHER CROWD AND THEN BACK PERHAPS NOT SORRY TO DOUBLE ON OUR STEPS IF NEED WERE AND LEAVING EVERY CROWD WITH A HAPPY THOUGHT OF
6454-120342-0034 THE STAR THE MANGER AND THE CHILD AT NINE WE BROUGHT UP AT MY HOUSE D STREET THREE DOORS FROM THE CORNER AND THE CHILDREN PICKED THEIR VERY BEST FOR POLLY AND MY SIX LITTLE GIRLS TO HEAR
6454-120342-0035 BEGGED THAT THEY MIGHT STAY TILL THE LAST MOMENT THEY COULD WALK BACK FROM THE STABLE AND RATHER WALK THAN NOT INDEED
412-126975-0000 THE FLYING STARS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CRIME I EVER COMMITTED FLAMBEAU WOULD SAY IN HIS HIGHLY MORAL OLD AGE
412-126975-0001 WAS ALSO BY A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE MY LAST IT WAS COMMITTED AT CHRISTMAS AS AN ARTIST
412-126975-0002 I HAD ALWAYS ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE CRIMES SUITABLE TO THE SPECIAL SEASON OR LANDSCAPES IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF CHOOSING THIS OR THAT TERRACE OR GARDEN FOR A CATASTROPHE AS IF FOR A STATUARY GROUP
412-126975-0003 THUS SQUIRES SHOULD BE SWINDLED IN LONG ROOMS PANELLED WITH OAK WHILE JEWS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD RATHER FIND THEMSELVES UNEXPECTEDLY PENNILESS
412-126975-0004 AMONG THE LIGHTS AND SCREENS OF THE CAFE RICHE THUS IN ENGLAND IF I WISHED TO RELIEVE A DEAN OF HIS RICHES WHICH IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE I WISHED TO FRAME HIM
412-126975-0005 IF I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR IN THE GREEN LAWNS AND GREY TOWERS OF SOME CATHEDRAL TOWN SIMILARLY IN FRANCE WHEN I HAD GOT MONEY OUT OF A RICH AND WICKED PEASANT
412-126975-0006 WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT GRATIFIED ME TO GET HIS INDIGNANT HEAD RELIEVED AGAINST A GREY LINE OF CLIPPED POPLARS AND THOSE SOLEMN PLAINS OF GAUL OVER WHICH BROODS THE MIGHTY SPIRIT OF MILLET
412-126975-0007 WELL MY LAST CRIME WAS A CHRISTMAS CRIME A CHEERY COSY ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASS CRIME A CRIME OF CHARLES DICKENS
412-126975-0008 I DID IT IN A GOOD OLD MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE NEAR PUTNEY A HOUSE WITH A CRESCENT OF CARRIAGE DRIVE A HOUSE WITH A STABLE BY THE SIDE OF IT A HOUSE WITH THE NAME ON THE TWO OUTER GATES
412-126975-0009 A HOUSE WITH A MONKEY TREE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THE SPECIES I REALLY THINK MY IMITATION OF DICKENS'S STYLE WAS DEXTEROUS AND LITERARY IT SEEMS ALMOST A PITY
412-126975-0010 I REPENTED THE SAME EVENING FLAMBEAU WOULD THEN PROCEED TO TELL THE STORY FROM THE INSIDE AND EVEN FROM THE INSIDE IT WAS ODD SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE
412-126975-0011 IT WAS PERFECTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND IT IS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THE STRANGER MUST STUDY IT FROM THIS STANDPOINT THE DRAMA MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEGUN WHEN THE FRONT DOORS OF THE HOUSE WITH THE STABLE
412-126975-0012 OPENED ON THE GARDEN WITH THE MONKEY TREE AND A YOUNG GIRL CAME OUT WITH BREAD TO FEED THE BIRDS ON THE AFTERNOON OF BOXING DAY SHE HAD A PRETTY FACE WITH BRAVE BROWN EYES
412-126975-0013 BUT HER FIGURE WAS BEYOND CONJECTURE FOR SHE WAS SO WRAPPED UP IN BROWN FURS THAT IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS HAIR AND WHICH WAS FUR BUT FOR THE ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SMALL TODDLING BEAR
412-126975-0014 THE WINTER AFTERNOON WAS REDDENING TOWARDS EVENING AND ALREADY A RUBY LIGHT WAS ROLLED OVER THE BLOOMLESS BEDS FILLING THEM AS IT WERE WITH THE GHOSTS OF THE DEAD ROSES
412-126975-0015 ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
412-126975-0016 FOR THE FOURTH OR FIFTH TIME THAT DAY BECAUSE THE DOG ATE IT PASSED UNOBTRUSIVELY DOWN THE LANE OF LAURELS AND INTO A GLIMMERING PLANTATION OF EVERGREENS BEHIND
412-126975-0017 HERE SHE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF WONDER REAL OR RITUAL AND LOOKING UP AT THE HIGH GARDEN WALL ABOVE HER BEHELD IT FANTASTICALLY BESTRIDDEN BY A SOMEWHAT FANTASTIC FIGURE
412-126975-0018 OH DON'T JUMP MISTER CROOK SHE CALLED OUT IN SOME ALARM IT'S MUCH TOO HIGH THE INDIVIDUAL RIDING THE PARTY WALL LIKE AN AERIAL HORSE
412-126975-0019 WAS A TALL ANGULAR YOUNG MAN WITH DARK HAIR STICKING UP LIKE A HAIR BRUSH INTELLIGENT AND EVEN DISTINGUISHED LINEAMENTS BUT A SALLOW AND ALMOST ALIEN COMPLEXION
412-126975-0020 THIS SHOWED THE MORE PLAINLY BECAUSE HE WORE AN AGGRESSIVE RED TIE THE ONLY PART OF HIS COSTUME OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE ANY CARE PERHAPS IT WAS A SYMBOL
412-126975-0021 HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE GIRL'S ALARMED ADJURATION BUT LEAPT LIKE A GRASSHOPPER TO THE GROUND BESIDE HER WHERE HE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BROKEN HIS LEGS I THINK I WAS MEANT TO BE A BURGLAR
412-126975-0022 HE SAID PLACIDLY AND I HAVE NO DOUBT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IF I HADN'T HAPPENED TO BE BORN IN THAT NICE HOUSE NEXT DOOR I CAN'T SEE ANY HARM IN IT ANYHOW
412-126975-0023 HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS SHE REMONSTRATED WELL SAID THE YOUNG MAN IF YOU'RE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WALL I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S WRONG TO CLIMB OVER IT
412-126975-0024 I NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL SAY OR DO NEXT SHE SAID I DON'T OFTEN KNOW MYSELF REPLIED MISTER CROOK BUT THEN I AM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WALL NOW
412-126975-0025 AND WHICH IS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WALL ASKED THE YOUNG LADY SMILING WHICHEVER SIDE YOU ARE ON SAID THE YOUNG MAN NAMED CROOK
412-126975-0026 AS THEY WENT TOGETHER THROUGH THE LAURELS TOWARDS THE FRONT GARDEN A MOTOR HORN SOUNDED THRICE COMING NEARER AND NEARER AND A CAR OF SPLENDID SPEED GREAT ELEGANCE
412-126975-0027 AND STOOD THROBBING HULLO HULLO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE RED TIE HERE'S SOMEBODY BORN ON THE RIGHT SIDE ANYHOW I DIDN'T KNOW MISS ADAMS THAT YOUR SANTA CLAUS WAS SO MODERN AS THIS
412-126975-0028 OH THAT'S MY GODFATHER SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER HE ALWAYS COMES ON BOXING DAY THEN AFTER AN INNOCENT PAUSE WHICH UNCONSCIOUSLY BETRAYED SOME LACK OF ENTHUSIASM
412-126975-0029 RUBY ADAMS ADDED HE IS VERY KIND JOHN CROOK JOURNALIST HAD HEARD OF THAT EMINENT CITY MAGNATE AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF THE CITY MAGNATE
412-126975-0030 HAD NOT HEARD OF HIM FOR IN CERTAIN ARTICLES IN THE CLARION OR THE NEW AGE SIR LEOPOLD HAD BEEN DEALT WITH AUSTERELY BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND GRIMLY WATCHED THE UNLOADING OF THE MOTOR CAR
412-126975-0031 WHICH WAS RATHER A LONG PROCESS A LARGE NEAT CHAUFFEUR IN GREEN GOT OUT FROM THE FRONT AND A SMALL NEAT MANSERVANT IN GREY GOT OUT FROM THE BACK AND BETWEEN THEM THEY DEPOSITED SIR LEOPOLD ON THE DOORSTEP
412-126975-0032 AND BEGAN TO UNPACK HIM LIKE SOME VERY CAREFULLY PROTECTED PARCEL RUGS ENOUGH TO STOCK A BAZAAR FURS OF ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST AND SCARVES OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
412-126975-0033 WERE UNWRAPPED ONE BY ONE TILL THEY REVEALED SOMETHING RESEMBLING THE HUMAN FORM THE FORM OF A FRIENDLY BUT FOREIGN LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY GOAT LIKE BEARD AND A BEAMING SMILE
412-126975-0034 WHO RUBBED HIS BIG FUR GLOVES TOGETHER LONG BEFORE THIS REVELATION WAS COMPLETE THE TWO BIG DOORS OF THE PORCH HAD OPENED IN THE MIDDLE AND COLONEL ADAMS FATHER OF THE FURRY YOUNG LADY
412-126975-0035 HAD COME OUT HIMSELF TO INVITE HIS EMINENT GUEST INSIDE HE WAS A TALL SUNBURNT AND VERY SILENT MAN WHO WORE A RED SMOKING CAP LIKE A FEZ MAKING HIM LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE ENGLISH SIRDARS
412-126975-0036 OR PASHAS IN EGYPT WITH HIM WAS HIS BROTHER IN LAW LATELY COME FROM CANADA A BIG AND RATHER BOISTEROUS YOUNG GENTLEMAN FARMER WITH A YELLOW BEARD BY NAME JAMES BLOUNT
412-126975-0037 WITH HIM ALSO WAS THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE OF THE PRIEST FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ROMAN CHURCH FOR THE COLONEL'S LATE WIFE HAD BEEN A CATHOLIC AND THE CHILDREN AS IS COMMON IN SUCH CASES HAD BEEN TRAINED TO FOLLOW HER
412-126975-0038 EVERYTHING SEEMED UNDISTINGUISHED ABOUT THE PRIEST EVEN DOWN TO HIS NAME WHICH WAS BROWN YET THE COLONEL HAD ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING COMPANIONABLE ABOUT HIM AND FREQUENTLY ASKED HIM TO SUCH FAMILY GATHERINGS
412-126975-0039 IN THE LARGE ENTRANCE HALL OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS AMPLE ROOM EVEN FOR SIR LEOPOLD AND THE REMOVAL OF HIS WRAPS PORCH AND VESTIBULE INDEED
412-126975-0040 WERE UNDULY LARGE IN PROPORTION TO THE HOUSE AND FORMED AS IT WERE A BIG ROOM WITH THE FRONT DOOR AT ONE END AND THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AT THE OTHER IN FRONT OF THE LARGE HALL FIRE
412-126975-0041 OVER WHICH HUNG THE COLONEL'S SWORD THE PROCESS WAS COMPLETED AND THE COMPANY INCLUDING THE SATURNINE CROOK PRESENTED TO SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER THAT VENERABLE FINANCIER HOWEVER
412-126975-0042 STILL SEEMED STRUGGLING WITH PORTIONS OF HIS WELL LINED ATTIRE AND AT LENGTH PRODUCED FROM A VERY INTERIOR TAIL COAT POCKET A BLACK OVAL CASE WHICH HE RADIANTLY EXPLAINED TO BE HIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR HIS GOD DAUGHTER
412-126975-0043 WITH AN UNAFFECTED VAIN GLORY THAT HAD SOMETHING DISARMING ABOUT IT HE HELD OUT THE CASE BEFORE THEM ALL IT FLEW OPEN AT A TOUCH AND HALF BLINDED THEM
412-126975-0044 IT WAS JUST AS IF A CRYSTAL FOUNTAIN HAD SPURTED IN THEIR EYES IN A NEST OF ORANGE VELVET LAY LIKE THREE EGGS THREE WHITE AND VIVID DIAMONDS THAT SEEMED TO SET THE VERY AIR ON FIRE ALL ROUND THEM
412-126975-0045 FISCHER STOOD BEAMING BENEVOLENTLY AND DRINKING DEEP OF THE ASTONISHMENT AND ECSTASY OF THE GIRL THE GRIM ADMIRATION AND GRUFF THANKS OF THE COLONEL THE WONDER OF THE WHOLE GROUP
412-126975-0046 I HAD TO BE CAREFUL OF EM COMING DOWN THEY'RE THE THREE GREAT AFRICAN DIAMONDS CALLED THE FLYING STARS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN STOLEN SO OFTEN ALL THE BIG CRIMINALS ARE ON THE TRACK
412-126975-0047 BUT EVEN THE ROUGH MEN ABOUT IN THE STREETS AND HOTELS COULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT THEIR HANDS OFF THEM I MIGHT HAVE LOST THEM ON THE ROAD HERE IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE QUITE NATURAL I SHOULD SAY
412-126975-0048 GROWLED THE MAN IN THE RED TIE I SHOULDN'T BLAME EM IF THEY HAD TAKEN EM WHEN THEY ASK FOR BREAD AND YOU DON'T EVEN GIVE THEM A STONE I THINK THEY MIGHT TAKE THE STONE FOR THEMSELVES
412-126975-0049 I WON'T HAVE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT CRIED THE GIRL WHO WAS IN A CURIOUS GLOW YOU'VE ONLY TALKED LIKE THAT SINCE YOU BECAME A HORRID WHAT'S HIS NAME YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
412-126975-0050 A SAINT SAID FATHER BROWN I THINK SAID SIR LEOPOLD WITH A SUPERCILIOUS SMILE THAT RUBY MEANS A SOCIALIST
412-126975-0051 A RADICAL DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO LIVES ON RADISHES REMARKED CROOK WITH SOME IMPATIENCE AND A CONSERVATIVE DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO PRESERVES JAM NEITHER I ASSURE YOU
412-126975-0052 DOES A SOCIALIST MEAN A MAN WHO DESIRES A SOCIAL EVENING WITH THE CHIMNEY SWEEP A SOCIALIST MEANS A MAN WHO WANTS ALL THE CHIMNEYS SWEPT AND ALL THE CHIMNEY SWEEPS PAID FOR IT BUT WHO WON'T ALLOW YOU
412-126975-0053 PUT IN THE PRIEST IN A LOW VOICE TO OWN YOUR OWN SOOT CROOK LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EYE OF INTEREST AND EVEN RESPECT DOES ONE WANT TO OWN SOOT HE ASKED ONE MIGHT
412-126975-0054 WITH SPECULATION IN HIS EYE I'VE HEARD THAT GARDENERS USE IT AND I ONCE MADE SIX CHILDREN HAPPY AT CHRISTMAS WHEN THE CONJUROR DIDN'T COME ENTIRELY WITH SOOT APPLIED EXTERNALLY
412-126975-0055 OH SPLENDID CRIED RUBY OH I WISH YOU'D DO IT TO THIS COMPANY THE BOISTEROUS CANADIAN MISTER BLOUNT WAS LIFTING HIS LOUD VOICE IN APPLAUSE
412-126975-0056 AND THE ASTONISHED FINANCIER HIS IN SOME CONSIDERABLE DEPRECATION WHEN A KNOCK SOUNDED AT THE DOUBLE FRONT DOORS THE PRIEST OPENED THEM AND THEY SHOWED AGAIN THE FRONT GARDEN OF EVERGREENS MONKEY TREE AND ALL
412-126975-0057 NOW GATHERING GLOOM AGAINST A GORGEOUS VIOLET SUNSET THE SCENE THUS FRAMED WAS SO COLOURED AND QUAINT LIKE A BACK SCENE IN A PLAY THAT THEY FORGOT A MOMENT THE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE STANDING IN THE DOOR
412-126975-0058 HE WAS DUSTY LOOKING AND IN A FRAYED COAT EVIDENTLY A COMMON MESSENGER ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN MISTER BLOUNT HE ASKED AND HELD FORWARD A LETTER DOUBTFULLY
412-126975-0059 MISTER BLOUNT STARTED AND STOPPED IN HIS SHOUT OF ASSENT RIPPING UP THE ENVELOPE WITH EVIDENT ASTONISHMENT HE READ IT HIS FACE CLOUDED A LITTLE AND THEN CLEARED AND HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW AND HOST
412-126975-0060 I'M SICK AT BEING SUCH A NUISANCE COLONEL HE SAID WITH THE CHEERY COLONIAL CONVENTIONS BUT WOULD IT UPSET YOU IF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE CALLED ON ME HERE TONIGHT ON BUSINESS IN POINT OF FACT IT'S FLORIAN
412-126975-0061 THAT FAMOUS FRENCH ACROBAT AND COMIC ACTOR I KNEW HIM YEARS AGO OUT WEST HE WAS A FRENCH CANADIAN BY BIRTH AND HE SEEMS TO HAVE BUSINESS FOR ME THOUGH I HARDLY GUESS WHAT
412-126975-0062 OF COURSE OF COURSE REPLIED THE COLONEL CARELESSLY MY DEAR CHAP ANY FRIEND OF YOURS NO DOUBT HE WILL PROVE AN ACQUISITION
412-126975-0063 HE'LL BLACK HIS FACE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED BLOUNT LAUGHING I DON'T DOUBT HE'D BLACK EVERYONE ELSE'S EYES I DON'T CARE I'M NOT REFINED
412-126975-0064 I LIKE THE JOLLY OLD PANTOMIME WHERE A MAN SITS ON HIS TOP HAT NOT ON MINE PLEASE SAID SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER WITH DIGNITY WELL WELL OBSERVED CROOK AIRILY
412-126975-0065 DON'T LET'S QUARREL THERE ARE LOWER JOKES THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT DISLIKE OF THE RED TIED YOUTH BORN OF HIS PREDATORY OPINIONS AND EVIDENT INTIMACY WITH THE PRETTY GODCHILD
412-126975-0066 LED FISCHER TO SAY IN HIS MOST SARCASTIC MAGISTERIAL MANNER NO DOUBT YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING MUCH LOWER THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT WHAT IS IT PRAY
412-126975-0067 LETTING A TOP HAT SIT ON YOU FOR INSTANCE SAID THE SOCIALIST NOW NOW NOW CRIED THE CANADIAN FARMER WITH HIS BARBARIAN BENEVOLENCE DON'T LET'S SPOIL A JOLLY EVENING
412-126975-0068 WHAT I SAY IS LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR THE COMPANY TONIGHT NOT BLACKING FACES OR SITTING ON HATS IF YOU DON'T LIKE THOSE BUT SOMETHING OF THE SORT WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE A PROPER OLD ENGLISH PANTOMIME
412-126975-0069 CLOWN COLUMBINE AND SO ON I SAW ONE WHEN I LEFT ENGLAND AT TWELVE YEARS OLD AND IT'S BLAZED IN MY BRAIN LIKE A BONFIRE EVER SINCE I CAME BACK TO THE OLD COUNTRY ONLY LAST YEAR
412-126975-0070 AND I FIND THE THING'S EXTINCT NOTHING BUT A LOT OF SNIVELLING FAIRY PLAYS I WANT A HOT POKER AND A POLICEMAN MADE INTO SAUSAGES AND THEY GIVE ME PRINCESSES MORALISING BY MOONLIGHT BLUE BIRDS
412-126975-0071 OR SOMETHING BLUE BEARD'S MORE IN MY LINE AND HIM I LIKE BEST WHEN HE TURNED INTO THE PANTALOON I'M ALL FOR MAKING A POLICEMAN INTO SAUSAGES SAID JOHN CROOK
412-126975-0072 IT'S A BETTER DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM THAN SOME RECENTLY GIVEN BUT SURELY THE GET UP WOULD BE TOO BIG A BUSINESS NOT A SCRAP CRIED BLOUNT QUITE CARRIED AWAY
412-126975-0073 A HARLEQUINADE'S THE QUICKEST THING WE CAN DO FOR TWO REASONS FIRST ONE CAN GAG TO ANY DEGREE AND SECOND ALL THE OBJECTS ARE HOUSEHOLD THINGS
412-126975-0074 TABLES AND TOWEL HORSES AND WASHING BASKETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S TRUE ADMITTED CROOK NODDING EAGERLY AND WALKING ABOUT BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HAVE MY POLICEMAN'S UNIFORM
412-126975-0075 HAVEN'T KILLED A POLICEMAN LATELY BLOUNT FROWNED THOUGHTFULLY A SPACE AND THEN SMOTE HIS THIGH YES WE CAN HE CRIED I'VE GOT FLORIAN'S ADDRESS HERE
412-126975-0076 AND HE KNOWS EVERY COSTUMIER IN LONDON I'LL PHONE HIM TO BRING A POLICE DRESS WHEN HE COMES AND HE WENT BOUNDING AWAY TO THE TELEPHONE OH IT'S GLORIOUS GODFATHER
412-126975-0077 ALMOST DANCING I'LL BE COLUMBINE AND YOU SHALL BE PANTALOON THE MILLIONAIRE HELD HIMSELF STIFF WITH A SORT OF HEATHEN SOLEMNITY I THINK MY DEAR HE SAID
412-126975-0078 YOU MUST GET SOMEONE ELSE FOR PANTALOON I WILL BE PANTALOON IF YOU LIKE SAID COLONEL ADAMS TAKING HIS CIGAR OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME
412-126975-0079 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A STATUE CRIED THE CANADIAN AS HE CAME BACK RADIANT FROM THE TELEPHONE THERE WE ARE ALL FITTED MISTER CROOK SHALL BE CLOWN
412-126975-0080 HE'S A JOURNALIST AND KNOWS ALL THE OLDEST JOKES I CAN BE HARLEQUIN THAT ONLY WANTS LONG LEGS AND JUMPING ABOUT MY FRIEND FLORIAN PHONES HE'S BRINGING THE POLICE COSTUME HE'S CHANGING ON THE WAY
412-126975-0081 WE CAN ACT IT IN THIS VERY HALL THE AUDIENCE SITTING ON THOSE BROAD STAIRS OPPOSITE ONE ROW ABOVE ANOTHER THESE FRONT DOORS CAN BE THE BACK SCENE EITHER OPEN OR SHUT SHUT
412-126975-0082 YOU SEE AN ENGLISH INTERIOR OPEN A MOONLIT GARDEN IT ALL GOES BY MAGIC AND SNATCHING A CHANCE PIECE OF BILLIARD CHALK FROM HIS POCKET HE RAN IT ACROSS THE HALL FLOOR
412-126975-0083 HALF WAY BETWEEN THE FRONT DOOR AND THE STAIRCASE TO MARK THE LINE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS HOW EVEN SUCH A BANQUET OF BOSH WAS GOT READY IN THE TIME REMAINED A RIDDLE
412-126975-0084 BUT THEY WENT AT IT WITH THAT MIXTURE OF RECKLESSNESS AND INDUSTRY THAT LIVES WHEN YOUTH IS IN A HOUSE AND YOUTH WAS IN THAT HOUSE THAT NIGHT THOUGH NOT ALL MAY HAVE ISOLATED THE TWO FACES AND HEARTS FROM WHICH IT FLAMED
412-126975-0085 AS ALWAYS HAPPENS THE INVENTION GREW WILDER AND WILDER THROUGH THE VERY TAMENESS OF THE BOURGEOIS CONVENTIONS FROM WHICH IT HAD TO CREATE THE COLUMBINE LOOKED CHARMING IN AN OUTSTANDING SKIRT
412-126975-0086 THAT STRANGELY RESEMBLED THE LARGE LAMP SHADE IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE CLOWN AND PANTALOON MADE THEMSELVES WHITE WITH FLOUR FROM THE COOK AND RED WITH ROUGE FROM SOME OTHER DOMESTIC WHO REMAINED
412-126975-0087 LIKE ALL TRUE CHRISTIAN BENEFACTORS ANONYMOUS THE HARLEQUIN ALREADY CLAD IN SILVER PAPER OUT OF CIGAR BOXES WAS WITH DIFFICULTY
412-126975-0088 PREVENTED FROM SMASHING THE OLD VICTORIAN LUSTRE CHANDELIERS THAT HE MIGHT COVER HIMSELF WITH RESPLENDENT CRYSTALS IN FACT HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DONE SO HAD NOT RUBY UNEARTHED SOME OLD PANTOMIME PASTE JEWELS
412-126975-0089 SHE HAD WORN AT A FANCY DRESS PARTY AS THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS INDEED HER UNCLE JAMES BLOUNT WAS GETTING ALMOST OUT OF HAND IN HIS EXCITEMENT HE WAS LIKE A SCHOOLBOY
412-126975-0090 HE PUT A PAPER DONKEY'S HEAD UNEXPECTEDLY ON FATHER BROWN WHO BORE IT PATIENTLY AND EVEN FOUND SOME PRIVATE MANNER OF MOVING HIS EARS HE EVEN ESSAYED TO PUT THE PAPER DONKEY'S TAIL
412-126975-0091 TO THE COAT TAILS OF SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER THIS HOWEVER WAS FROWNED DOWN UNCLE IS TOO ABSURD CRIED RUBY TO CROOK ROUND WHOSE SHOULDERS SHE HAD SERIOUSLY PLACED A STRING OF SAUSAGES
412-126975-0092 WHY IS HE SO WILD HE IS HARLEQUIN TO YOUR COLUMBINE SAID CROOK I AM ONLY THE CLOWN WHO MAKES THE OLD JOKES I WISH YOU WERE THE HARLEQUIN
412-126975-0093 SHE SAID AND LEFT THE STRING OF SAUSAGES SWINGING FATHER BROWN THOUGH HE KNEW EVERY DETAIL DONE BEHIND THE SCENES AND HAD EVEN EVOKED APPLAUSE BY HIS TRANSFORMATION OF A PILLOW INTO A PANTOMIME BABY
412-126975-0094 WENT ROUND TO THE FRONT AND SAT AMONG THE AUDIENCE WITH ALL THE SOLEMN EXPECTATION OF A CHILD AT HIS FIRST MATINEE THE SPECTATORS WERE FEW RELATIONS ONE OR TWO LOCAL FRIENDS
5022-29411-0000 MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
5022-29411-0001 STILL WHILE CRISTEL'S ENTREATIES AND CRISTEL'S INFLUENCE HAD FAILED TO SHAKE ME GLOODY'S STRANGE LANGUAGE AND GLOODY'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT HAD TROUBLED MY MIND I FELT VAGUELY UNEASY IRRITATED BY MY OWN DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
5022-29411-0002 IF I HAD BEEN A PHILOSOPHER I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SYMPTOMS OF A VERY COMMON ATTACK OF A VERY WIDELY SPREAD MORAL MALADY THE MEANEST OF ALL HUMAN INFIRMITIES IS ALSO THE MOST UNIVERSAL AND THE NAME OF IT IS SELF ESTEEM
5022-29411-0003 IT IS PERHAPS ONLY RIGHT TO ADD THAT MY PATIENCE HAD BEEN TRIED BY THE PROGRESS OF DOMESTIC EVENTS WHICH AFFECTED LADY LENA AND MYSELF VIEWED AS VICTIMS CALLING WITH MY STEPMOTHER AT LORD UPPERCLIFF'S HOUSE LATER IN THE DAY
5022-29411-0004 OR MADE AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING TOGETHER CONFIDENTIALLY IN A CORNER AND ONCE OR TWICE I CAUGHT THEM LOOKING AT LADY LENA AND AT ME EVEN LORD UPPERCLIFF PERHAPS NOT YET TAKEN INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE
5022-29411-0005 NOTICED THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWO LADIES AND SEEMED TO BE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THEM WHEN MISSUS ROYLAKE AND I WERE TOGETHER AGAIN ON OUR WAY HOME I WAS PREPARED TO HEAR THE PRAISE OF LADY LENA FOLLOWED BY A DELICATE EXAMINATION INTO THE STATE OF MY HEART
5022-29411-0006 NEITHER OF THESE ANTICIPATIONS WAS REALIZED ONCE MORE MY CLEVER STEPMOTHER HAD PUZZLED ME MISSUS ROYLAKE TALKED AS FLUENTLY AS EVER EXHAUSTING ONE COMMON PLACE SUBJECT AFTER ANOTHER
5022-29411-0007 WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO MY LORD'S DAUGHTER TO MY MATRIMONIAL PROSPECTS OR TO MY VISITS AT THE MILL I WAS SECRETLY ANNOYED FEELING THAT MY STEPMOTHER'S SINGULAR INDIFFERENCE TO DOMESTIC INTERESTS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
5022-29411-0008 RETURNING TO THE HOUSE I TRIED TO OCCUPY MYSELF WITH MY COLLECTION OF INSECTS SADLY NEGLECTED OF LATE USELESS MY OWN MOTHS FAILED TO INTEREST ME I WENT BACK TO THE GARDEN PASSING THE OPEN WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LOWER ROOMS WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE TERRACE
5022-29411-0009 I SAW MISSUS ROYLAKE READING A BOOK IN SAD COLORED BINDING SHE WAS YAWNING OVER IT FEARFULLY WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER EQUAL TO ANY EMERGENCY THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN INSTANTLY HANDED TO ME A SECOND AND SIMILAR VOLUME
5022-29411-0010 I LOOKED AT THE BOOK I OPENED THE BOOK I RECOVERED MY PRESENCE OF MIND AND HANDED IT BACK IF A FEMALE HUMBUG WAS ON ONE SIDE OF THE WINDOW A MALE HUMBUG WAS ON THE OTHER
5022-29411-0011 WHICH WAY DID I TURN MY STEPS MEN WILL WONDER WHAT POSSESSED ME WOMEN WILL THINK IT A PROCEEDING THAT DID ME CREDIT I TOOK THE FAMILIAR ROAD WHICH LED TO THE GLOOMY WOOD AND THE GUILTY RIVER THE LONGING IN ME TO SEE CRISTEL AGAIN WAS MORE THAN I COULD RESIST
5022-29411-0012 NOT BECAUSE I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER ONLY BECAUSE I HAD LEFT HER IN DISTRESS BEYOND THE SPRING AND WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE RIVER I SAW A LADY ADVANCING TOWARDS ME ON THE PATH WHICH LED FROM THE MILL BRISK SMILING TRIPPING ALONG LIKE A YOUNG GIRL
5022-29411-0013 BEHOLD THE MOCK REPUBLICAN KNOWN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AS LADY RACHEL SHE HELD OUT BOTH HANDS TO ME BUT FOR HER PETTICOATS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD MET WITH A JOLLY YOUNG MAN
5022-29411-0014 PATRONIZING PIETY ON THE WAY TO AFTERNOON CHURCH I MUST POSITIVELY MAKE A SKETCH OF THE COTTAGE BY THE MILL I MEAN OF COURSE THE PICTURESQUE SIDE OF IT THAT FINE GIRL OF TOLLER'S WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR SHE IS REALLY HANDSOMER THAN EVER ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HER YOU WICKED MAN
5022-29411-0015 WHEN WE HAD LEFT EACH OTHER I THOUGHT OF THE ABSENT CAPTAIN IN THE NAVY WHO WAS LADY RACHEL'S HUSBAND HE WAS A PERFECT STRANGER BUT I PUT MYSELF IN HIS PLACE AND FELT THAT I TOO SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SEA
5022-29411-0016 OLD TOLLER WAS ALONE IN HIS KITCHEN EVIDENTLY ANNOYED AND ANGRY WE ARE ALL AT SIXES AND SEVENS MISTER GERARD I'VE HAD ANOTHER ROW WITH THAT DEAF DEVIL MY NEW NAME FOR HIM AND I THINK IT'S RATHER CLEVER
5022-29411-0017 HE SWEARS SIR THAT HE WON'T GO AT THE END OF HIS WEEK'S NOTICE
5022-29411-0018 AND SHOOT THE MAN AND SHOOT HIMSELF AHA
5022-29411-0019 I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM YOU MARK MY WORDS I'LL BE EVEN WITH HIM THAT OLD TOLLER THE MOST EXASPERATING OF MEN JUDGED BY A QUICK TEMPER HAD IRRITATED MY FRIEND INTO SPEAKING RASHLY WAS PLAIN ENOUGH NEVERTHELESS I FELT SOME ANXIETY
5022-29411-0020 ABOUT CRISTEL AFTER LOOKING ROUND THE KITCHEN AGAIN I ASKED WHERE SHE WAS SITTING FORLORN IN HER BEDROOM CRYING HER FATHER TOLD ME I WENT OUT FOR A WALK BY THE RIVER AND I SAT DOWN AND BEING SUNDAY I FELL ASLEEP WHEN I WOKE AND GOT HOME AGAIN JUST NOW THAT
5022-29411-0021 WAS HOW I FOUND HER I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR MY GIRL CRYING SHE'S AS GOOD AS GOLD AND BETTER NO SIR OUR DEAF DEVIL IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THIS HE HAS GIVEN CRISTY NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIM SHE SAYS SO HERSELF AND SHE NEVER TOLD A LIE YET
5022-29411-0022 BUT MISTER TOLLER I OBJECTED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO DISTRESS HER HAS SHE NOT TOLD YOU WHAT IT IS NOT SHE OBSTINATE ABOUT IT LEAVES ME TO GUESS IT'S CLEAR TO MY MIND MISTER GERARD THAT SOMEBODY HAS GOT AT HER IN MY ABSENCE
5022-29411-0023 YOU WILL ASK ME WHO THE PERSON IS
5022-29411-0024 BUT YOU MEAN TO TRY YES I MEAN TO TRY HE ANSWERED ME WITH LITTLE OF THE ENERGY WHICH GENERALLY DISTINGUISHED HIM PERHAPS HE WAS FATIGUED OR PERHAPS HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF I OFFERED A SUGGESTION WHEN WE ARE
5022-29411-0025 IN WANT OF HELP I SAID WE SOMETIMES FIND IT NEARER THAN WE HAD VENTURED TO EXPECT AT OUR OWN DOORS THE ANCIENT MILLER ROSE AT THAT HINT LIKE A FISH AT A FLY GLOODY HE CRIED FIND HIM AT ONCE MISTER TOLLER
5022-29411-0026 I'VE GOT BURDENS ON MY MIND HE EXPLAINED OR I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT TOO HAVING DONE JUSTICE TO HIS OWN ABILITIES HE BUSTLED OUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE HE WAS BACK AGAIN IN A STATE OF BREATHLESS TRIUMPH GLOODY HAS SEEN THE PERSON HE ANNOUNCED AND
5022-29411-0027 I BECKONED TO GLOODY WAITING MODESTLY AT THE DOOR TO COME IN AND TELL ME WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED I SAW HER OUTSIDE SIR RAPPING AT THE DOOR HERE WITH HER PARASOL THAT WAS THE SERVANT'S REPORT HER PARASOL
5022-29411-0028 MISS CRISTEL LOOKED LIKE A PERSON SURPRISED AT SEEING A STRANGER WHAT I SHOULD CALL A FREE AND EASY STRANGER SHE WALKED IN SIR AS IF THE PLACE BELONGED TO HER I AM NOT SUSPICIOUS BY NATURE AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE
5022-29411-0029 THE HAT I HAD SEEN ON THE HEAD OF THAT HATEFUL WOMAN WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED FOR A MAN SLY OLD TOLLER LEAVING GLOODY UNNOTICED AND KEEPING HIS EYE ON ME SAW THE SIGNS OF CONVICTION IN MY FACE AND SAID WITH HIS CUSTOMARY AUDACITY
5022-29411-0030 WHO IS SHE I FOLLOWED AT MY HUMBLE DISTANCE THE EXAMPLE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT WHEN INQUISITIVE PEOPLE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS IN PLAIN ENGLISH I DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRANGER WEARING THE GREEN HAT
5022-29411-0031 BUT I WAS NATURALLY DESIROUS OF DISCOVERING NEXT WHAT LADY RACHEL HAD SAID AND I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH CRISTEL HER FAR SEEING FATHER MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE PERCEIVED A CHANCE OF LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION
5022-29411-0032 HE LED ME TO THE DOOR OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ROOM AND STOOD CLOSE BY WHEN I KNOCKED SOFTLY AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD COME OUT THE TONE OF THE POOR GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING FORGIVE ME SIR I CAN'T DO IT CONVICTED THE SHE SOCIALIST AS I THOUGHT
5022-29411-0033 OF MERCILESS CONDUCT OF SOME SORT ASSUMING THIS CONCLUSION TO BE THE RIGHT ONE I DETERMINED THEN AND THERE THAT LADY RACHEL SHOULD NOT PASS THE DOORS OF TRIMLEY DEEN AGAIN IF HER BOSOM FRIEND RESENTED THAT WISE ACT OF SEVERITY BY LEAVING THE HOUSE I SHOULD SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION
5022-29411-0034 AND SHOULD REMEMBER THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH PLEASURE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE ILL CRISTEL WAS ALL I COULD FIND TO SAY UNDER THE DOUBLE DISADVANTAGE OF SPEAKING THROUGH A DOOR AND HAVING A FATHER LISTENING AT MY SIDE OH NO MISTER GERARD NOT ILL
5022-29411-0035 PRAY BE KINDER TO ME THAN EVER PRAY LET ME BE I SAID I WOULD RETURN ON THE NEXT DAY AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A SORE HEART OLD TOLLER HIGHLY APPROVED OF MY CONDUCT HE RUBBED HIS FLESHLESS HANDS AND WHISPERED
5022-29411-0036 YOU'LL GET IT OUT OF CRISTY TO MORROW AND I'LL HELP YOU I FOUND GLOODY WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE HE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT MISS CRISTEL HIS ONLY EXCUSE HE TOLD ME BEING THE FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT BE ILL HAVING SET HIM AT EASE IN THAT PARTICULAR I SAID
5022-29411-0037 YOU SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN MISS CRISTEL HIS ANSWER RAISED HIM A STEP HIGHER IN MY ESTIMATION HOW CAN I HELP IT SIR AN ODD MAN WITH A PERSONAL APPEARANCE THAT MIGHT EXCITE A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM IN SOME MINDS
5022-29411-0038 I FAILED TO SEE IT MYSELF IN THAT LIGHT IT STRUCK ME AS I WALKED HOME THAT CRISTEL MIGHT HAVE MADE MANY A WORSE FRIEND THAN THE RETIRED PRIZE FIGHTER A CHANGE IN MY MANNER WAS OF COURSE REMARKED BY MISSUS ROYLAKE'S READY OBSERVATION
5022-29411-0039 I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN ANNOYED AND OFFERED NO OTHER EXPLANATION WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY AND NO SURPRISE MORE WONDERFUL STILL AT EVERY FAIR OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED SHE KEPT OUT OF MY WAY
5022-29411-0040 MY NEXT DAY'S ENGAGEMENT BEING FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING I PUT MISSUS ROYLAKE'S SELF CONTROL TO A NEW TEST WITH PREFATORY EXCUSES I INFORMED HER THAT I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DINE AT HOME AS USUAL IMPOSSIBLE AS IT WAS THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO HEAR THIS
5022-29411-0041 ON THE RIVER MARGIN OF THE WOOD I WAS CONFRONTED BY A WILD GLEAM OF BEAUTY IN THE FAMILIAR VIEW FOR WHICH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE HAD NOT PREPARED ME AM I WRONG IN BELIEVING THAT ALL SCENERY NO MATTER HOW MAGNIFICENT OR HOW HOMELY IT MAY BE
5022-29411-0042 DERIVES A SPLENDOR NOT ITS OWN FROM FAVOURING CONDITIONS OF LIGHT AND SHADE OUR GLOOMY TREES AND OUR REPELLENT RIVER PRESENTED AN ASPECT SUPERBLY TRANSFIGURED UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE TOWERING CLOUDS THE FANTASTIC WREATHS OF THE MIST
5022-29411-0043 AND THE LURID REDDENING OF THE SUN AS IT STOOPED TO ITS SETTING LOVELY INTERFUSIONS OF SOBERED COLOR RESTED FADED RETURNED AGAIN ON THE UPPER LEAVES OF THE FOLIAGE AS THEY LIGHTLY MOVED THE MIST ROLLING CAPRICIOUSLY OVER THE WATERS
5022-29411-0044 WHILE IT DIMMED THE TURBID EARTHY YELLOW THAT DISCOLORED AND DEGRADED THE STREAM UNDER THE FULL GLARE OF DAY WHILE MY EYES FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE VIEW AS THE HOUR ADVANCED TENDER AND SOLEMN INFLUENCES BREATHED THEIR BALM OVER MY MIND
5022-29411-0045 DAYS HAPPY DAYS THAT WERE PAST REVIVED AGAIN I WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH MY MOTHER AMONG THE SCENES THAT WERE ROUND ME AND LEARNT FROM HER TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH WITH A HEART THAT FELT IT
5022-29411-0046 WE WERE TRACING OUR WAY ALONG OUR FAVORITE WOODLAND PATH AND WE FOUND A COMPANION OF TENDER YEARS HIDING FROM US SHE SHOWED HERSELF BLUSHING HESITATING OFFERING A NOSEGAY OF WILD FLOWERS MY MOTHER WHISPERED TO ME
5022-29411-0047 I THANKED THE LITTLE MILL GIRL AND GAVE HER A KISS DID I FEEL THE CHILD'S BREATH IN MY DAY DREAM STILL FLUTTERING ON MY CHEEK WAS I CONSCIOUS OF HER TOUCH I STARTED TREMBLED RETURNED RELUCTANTLY TO MY PRESENT SELF
5022-29411-0048 A VISIBLE HAND TOUCHED MY ARM AS I TURNED SUDDENLY A LIVING BREATH PLAYED ON MY FACE THE CHILD HAD FADED INTO A VANISHING SHADE THE PERFECTED WOMAN WHO HAD GROWN FROM HER HAD STOLEN ON ME UNAWARES AND WAS ASKING ME TO PARDON HER
5022-29411-0049 MISTER GERARD YOU WERE LOST IN YOUR THOUGHTS I SPOKE AND YOU NEVER HEARD ME I LOOKED AT HER IN SILENCE WAS THIS THE DEAR CRISTEL SO WELL KNOWN TO ME OR WAS IT A MOCKERY OF HER THAT HAD TAKEN HER PLACE
5022-29411-0050 YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I ANSWERED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I SAW YOU LAST WHAT IS IT NOTHING I ADVANCED A STEP AND DREW HER CLOSER TO ME A DARK FLUSH DISCOLORED HER FACE AN OVERPOWERING BRILLIANCY FLASHED FROM HER EYES
5022-29411-0051 THERE WAS AN HYSTERICAL DEFIANCE IN HER MANNER ARE YOU EXCITED ARE YOU ANGRY ARE YOU TRYING TO STARTLE ME BY ACTING A PART I URGED THOSE QUESTIONS ON HER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I WAS LOUDLY AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED
5022-29411-0052 THE DEAF GENTLEMAN SUBMITTED WHY DID YOU INVITE YOURSELF BECAUSE A TEA PARTY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT A WOMAN HER MANNER WAS AS STRANGELY ALTERED AS HER LOOKS THAT SHE WAS BESIDE HERSELF FOR THE MOMENT I CLEARLY SAW
5022-29411-0053 I KNOW THAT SHE HAS VISITED YOU AND SPOKEN TO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE HAS SAID I CAN GUESS
5022-29411-0054 HER MANNER HAD BECOME QUIETER HER FACE WAS MORE COMPOSED HER EXPRESSION ALMOST RECOVERED ITS NATURAL CHARM WHILE SHE SPOKE OF LADY RACHEL I WAS STUPEFIED TRY SIR TO FORGET IT AND FORGIVE IT SHE RESUMED GENTLY
5022-29411-0055 IF I HAVE MISBEHAVED MYSELF I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING OR DOING I POINTED TO THE NEW SIDE OF THE COTTAGE BEHIND US IS THE CAUSE THERE I ASKED NO NO INDEED
5022-29411-0056 IN THAT SHORT TIME I TOLD HER THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND IN MY GARDEN LOOKING AT THE FLOWERS AS HE HAD DONE NO HARM I SAID
5022-29411-0057 AND FELT I DON'T DOUBT IT I HAD INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE THAN THIS BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF GLOODY'S MYSTERIOUS PREVARICATION AND OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH I HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FELT WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARDS LED ME I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY HOW
5022-29411-0058 INTO ASSOCIATING CRISTEL'S AGITATION WITH SOMETHING WHICH THIS MAN MIGHT HAVE SAID TO HER I WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING THE QUESTION WHEN SHE HELD UP HER HAND AND SAID HUSH THE WIND WAS BLOWING TOWARDS US FROM THE RIVER SIDE VILLAGE TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED
5022-29411-0059 I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS KYLAM IT WAS SITUATED BEHIND A PROMONTORY OF THE RIVER BANK CLOTHED THICKLY WITH TREES AND WAS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE MILL IN THE PRESENT DIRECTION OF THE WIND WE COULD HEAR THE STRIKING OF THE CHURCH CLOCK
5022-29411-0060 CRISTEL COUNTED THE STROKES SEVEN SHE SAID ARE YOU DETERMINED TO KEEP YOUR ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD REPEATED IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE AND WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER COLOR TO PALENESS THE STRANGE QUESTION PUT TO ME BY GLOODY
5022-29411-0061 IN HIS CASE I HAD FAILED TO TRACE THE MOTIVE I TRIED TO DISCOVER IT NOW TELL ME WHY I OUGHT TO BREAK MY ENGAGEMENT I SAID REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU AT THE SPRING SHE ANSWERED
5022-29411-0062 YOU ARE DECEIVED BY A FALSE FRIEND WHO LIES TO YOU AND HATES YOU THE MAN SHE WAS SPEAKING OF TURNED THE CORNER OF THE NEW COTTAGE
5022-29411-0063 IT'S TOO LATE NOW INSTEAD OF LETTING ME PRECEDE HER AS I HAD ANTICIPATED SHE RAN ON BEFORE ME MADE A SIGN TO THE DEAF MAN AS SHE PASSED HIM NOT TO STOP HER AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR OF HER FATHER'S SIDE OF THE COTTAGE
5022-29411-0064 I WAS LEFT TO DECIDE FOR MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE IF I HAD BEEN TWENTY YEARS OLDER
5022-29411-0065 THE FEAR OF APPEARING TO BE AFRAID AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE MADE MY EXCUSES TO MY HOST OF THE EVENING HOW WOULD MY MORAL COURAGE HAVE ANSWERED HIM IF HE HAD ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION USELESS TO SPECULATE ON IT HAD I POSSESSED THE WISDOM OF MIDDLE LIFE
5022-29411-0066 HIS BOOK OF LEAVES WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIM IN MY OWN HANDWRITING THAT I BELIEVED IN HIS BETTER NATURE
5022-29411-0067 EXPLAIN IT WHO CAN I KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO DRINK TEA WITH HIM AND YET I WAS UNWILLING TO ADVANCE A FEW STEPS AND MEET HIM ON THE ROAD I FIND A NEW BOND OF UNION BETWEEN US HE SAID AS HE JOINED ME WE BOTH FEEL THAT
5022-29411-0068 HE POINTED TO THE GRANDLY DARKENING VIEW THE TWO MEN WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED THE MYSTERY OF THOSE GROWING SHADOWS AND FADING LIGHTS LIE IN THE GRAVES OF REMBRANDT AND TURNER SHALL WE GO TO TEA ON OUR WAY TO HIS ROOM WE STOPPED AT THE MILLER'S DOOR
5022-29411-0069 WILL YOU INQUIRE HE SAID IF MISS CRISTEL IS READY I WENT IN OLD TOLLER WAS IN THE KITCHEN SMOKING HIS PIPE WITHOUT APPEARING TO ENJOY IT WHAT'S COME TO MY GIRL HE ASKED THE MOMENT HE SAW ME
5022-29411-0070 TO DAY SHE'S IN HER ROOM PRAYING THE WARNINGS WHICH I HAD NEGLECTED ROSE IN JUDGMENT AGAINST ME I WAS SILENT I WAS AWED BEFORE I RECOVERED MYSELF CRISTEL ENTERED THE KITCHEN HER FATHER WHISPERED
125-121342-0000 A FATHOM DEEP IN SLEEP I LIE WITH OLD DESIRES RESTRAINED BEFORE TO CLAMOR LIFEWARD WITH A CRY AS DARK FLIES OUT THE GREYING DOOR AND SO IN QUEST OF CREEDS TO SHARE I SEEK ASSERTIVE DAY AGAIN
125-121342-0001 BUT OLD MONOTONY IS THERE ENDLESS AVENUES OF RAIN OH MIGHT I RISE AGAIN MIGHT I THROW OFF THE HEAT OF THAT OLD WINE SEE THE NEW MORNING MASS THE SKY WITH FAIRY TOWERS LINE ON LINE
125-121342-0002 THE AIR BECAME GRAY AND OPALESCENT A SOLITARY LIGHT SUDDENLY OUTLINED A WINDOW OVER THE WAY THEN ANOTHER LIGHT THEN A HUNDRED MORE DANCED AND GLIMMERED INTO VISION UNDER HIS FEET A THICK IRON STUDDED SKYLIGHT TURNED YELLOW
125-121342-0003 IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
125-121342-0004 THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
125-121342-0005 HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
125-121342-0006 CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
125-121342-0007 THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
125-121342-0008 FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS
125-121342-0009 A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT
125-121342-0010 AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
125-121342-0011 THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
125-121342-0012 AT BEST JUST PEOPLE TOO HOT OR TOO COLD TIRED WORRIED HE PICTURED THE ROOMS WHERE THESE PEOPLE LIVED WHERE THE PATTERNS OF THE BLISTERED WALL PAPERS WERE HEAVY REITERATED SUNFLOWERS ON GREEN AND YELLOW BACKGROUNDS
125-121342-0013 AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
125-121342-0014 LEAVING HARD BROWN DEPOSITS IN THE BOWL IT WAS NOT SO BAD WHERE THERE WERE ONLY MEN OR ELSE ONLY WOMEN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE VILELY HERDED THAT IT ALL SEEMED SO ROTTEN IT WAS SOME SHAME THAT WOMEN GAVE OFF AT HAVING MEN SEE THEM TIRED AND POOR
125-121342-0015 IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
125-121342-0016 AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
125-121342-0017 HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
125-121342-0018 AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
125-121342-0019 HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
125-121342-0020 NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
125-121342-0021 MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS
125-121342-0022 SOMEWHERE IN HIS MIND A CONVERSATION BEGAN RATHER RESUMED ITS PLACE IN HIS ATTENTION IT WAS COMPOSED NOT OF TWO VOICES BUT OF ONE WHICH ACTED ALIKE AS QUESTIONER AND ANSWERER QUESTION WELL WHAT'S THE SITUATION ANSWER

250-142276-0000 CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
250-142276-0001 HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
250-142276-0002 WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
250-142276-0003 IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
250-142276-0004 AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
250-142276-0005 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0006 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
250-142276-0007 MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
250-142276-0008 A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
250-142276-0009 AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
250-142276-0010 AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD BYES
250-142276-0011 OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
250-142276-0012 THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
250-142276-0013 HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
250-142276-0014 TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
250-142276-0015 THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
250-142276-0016 TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
250-142276-0017 I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
250-142276-0018 I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
250-142276-0019 FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS
250-142276-0020 AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
250-142276-0021 NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
250-142276-0022 WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
250-142276-0023 FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
250-142276-0024 THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
250-142276-0025 AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
250-142276-0026 THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
250-142276-0027 LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
250-142276-0028 CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
250-142276-0029 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
250-142276-0030 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0031 BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
250-142276-0032 AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
250-142276-0033 THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
250-142276-0034 AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
250-142276-0035 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
250-142276-0036 BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
250-142276-0037 NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
250-142276-0038 HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
250-142276-0039 IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
250-142276-0040 ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON OH I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS
250-142276-0041 I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
250-142276-0042 AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
250-142276-0043 BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
250-142276-0044 AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
250-142276-0045 HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
250-142276-0046 SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
250-142276-0047 WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
250-142276-0048 NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
250-142276-0049 WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
250-142276-0050 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142276-0051 ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
250-142276-0052 THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
250-142276-0053 WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
250-142276-0054 HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
250-142276-0055 BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
250-142276-0056 ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
250-142276-0057 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142276-0058 THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
250-142276-0059 A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
250-142276-0060 HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
250-142276-0061 NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
250-142276-0062 SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
250-142276-0063 BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
250-142286-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE MORNING CALLS WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
250-142286-0001 MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
250-142286-0002 BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
250-142286-0003 WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB HIRE
250-142286-0004 THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
250-142286-0005 BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
250-142286-0006 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SILENT AFTER THIS FOR HER LAST WORDS BORE RELATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MORTIFIED HER SHE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPT FOR A WEAK CHARACTER AND FANNY WAS WEAK IN THE VERY POINTS IN WHICH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE STRONG
250-142286-0007 MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
250-142286-0008 WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
250-142286-0009 THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
250-142286-0010 BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
250-142286-0011 WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
250-142286-0012 MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
250-142286-0013 AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
250-142286-0014 IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
250-142286-0015 HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
250-142286-0016 FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
250-142286-0017 BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
250-142286-0018 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
250-142286-0019 AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
250-142286-0020 AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
250-142286-0021 MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
250-142286-0022 WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
250-142286-0023 FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
250-142286-0024 MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE
250-142286-0025 TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
250-142286-0026 BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
250-142286-0027 MAY I INQUIRE MARGARET HAD NOT THE WORDS READY FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH TOOK HER A LITTLE BY SURPRISE SO MISS THORNTON REPLIED
250-142286-0028 AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
250-142286-0029 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET
250-142286-0030 THEN SHE FELT THAT BY CONCEALING HER UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO ALL SUCH PLACES SHE WAS HARDLY SPEAKING WITH TRUTH SO SHE WENT ON
250-142286-0031 EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
250-142286-0032 SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON
5652-39938-0000 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK OF THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT BEGIN WITH HIS CURATIVE EFFORTS THERAPY IS ALWAYS ONLY THE LAST STEP DIAGNOSIS AND OBSERVATION HAVE TO PRECEDE AND AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE IS ESSENTIAL
5652-39938-0001 THE WHOLE EQUIPMENT OF THE MODERN LABORATORY OUGHT TO BE PUT AT ITS DISPOSAL PERCEPTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS REACTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS OUGHT TO BE EXAMINED WITH THE SAME CAREFULNESS WITH WHICH THE CONSCIENTIOUS PHYSICIAN EXAMINES THE BLOOD AND THE URINE
5652-39938-0002 AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
5652-39938-0003 IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
5652-39938-0004 THE INTELLECTUAL CLEARNESS OF THE PATIENT TOO EASILY TEMPTS ONE INTO TRUSTING THE SINCERITY OF HIS STORY AND YET THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS CLUSTERING PERHAPS ABOUT LOVE OR AMBITION ABOUT VICE OR CRIME ABOUT BUSINESS FAILURE OR FAMILY SECRETS
5652-39938-0005 WITHHELD AND MAY FRUSTRATE EVERY PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE WHERE SUSPICION IS AWAKE AND MERE CONFIDENTIAL TALK AND PERSUASION SEEM INSUFFICIENT
5652-39938-0006 THE PHYSICIAN MAY FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF HIS PATIENT IN DRAWING THE THOUGHTS OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS SKILL TACT AND EXPERIENCE ARE NEEDED THERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
5652-39938-0007 WILL SUPPORT THE PHYSICIAN AND ACCORDINGLY HIS EXAMINATION IS NOT OBLIGED TO TRAP THE PATIENT BUT SIMPLY TO GUIDE HIM TO IMPORTANT POINTS BUT THEN BEGINS THE MOST ESSENTIAL STUDY OF DIAGNOSTICAL DIFFERENTIATION
5652-39938-0008 WITH ALL THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT OF NEUROLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE PARTICULAR CASE FROM SIMILAR ONES AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER HE DEALS WITH FOR INSTANCE A HYSTERIC OR WITH A PARANOIAC
5652-39938-0009 AND HE WILL NOT FORGET THAT THERE EXIST ALMOST NO SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS DISEASES WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HYSTERIC MAY NOT IMITATE FOR A TIME
5652-39938-0010 NOT OURS IS THE TASK OF ANALYZING SPECIAL METHODS OF NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS ARE USED IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC AND IN THE OFFICE OF THE NERVE SPECIALIST THERE THE FAMILY HISTORY WITH REFERENCE TO NERVOUS AND OTHER DISEASES
5652-39938-0011 IN A SIMILAR WAY THE PSYCHICAL EXAMINATION TESTS THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS THE VARIATIONS AND DEFECTS OF MEMORY AND ATTENTION OF JUDGMENT AND REASONING OF ORIENTATION AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS OF EMOTIONS AND VOLITIONS
5652-39938-0012 BUT ONE RULE IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM NEVER USE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN A SCHEMATIC WAY LIKE A RIGID PATTERN SCHEMATIC TREATMENT IS A POOR TREATMENT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE BUT IN PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS IT IS DISASTROUS
5652-39938-0013 THERE ARE NO TWO CASES ALIKE AND NOT ONLY THE EASILY RECOGNIZABLE DIFFERENCES OF SEX AND AGE AND OCCUPATION AND EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL MEANS AND TEMPERAMENT AND CAPACITY ARE DECISIVE
5652-39938-0014 BUT ALL THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS OF PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AMBITIONS AND PROSPECTS MEMORIES AND FANCIES
5652-39938-0015 EVERY ELEMENT OF A MAN'S LIFE HISTORY IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD HIS LOVE AND HIS SUCCESSES HIS DISEASES AND HIS DISTRESSES HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND HIS READING HIS TALENT HIS CHARACTER HIS SINCERITY HIS ENERGY HIS INTELLIGENCE
5652-39938-0016 EVERYTHING OUGHT TO DETERMINE THE CHOICE OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC STEPS AS IT IS ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE ALL THOSE FACTORS BY ANY SUFFICIENT INQUIRY
5652-39938-0017 MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF METHOD MUST BE LEFT TO THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN IN WHICH WIDE EXPERIENCE SOLID KNOWLEDGE TACT AND SYMPATHY OUGHT TO BE BLENDED EVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THE PATIENT REACTS ON THE METHOD WILL OFTEN GUIDE THE INSTINCT OF THE WELL TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
5652-39938-0018 IT IS THEREFORE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN SIMPLY DECIDE BEFOREHAND ON A DEFINITE COURSE OF PSYCHICAL TREATMENT AND LEAVE THE CARRYING OUT TO A WELL MEANING MINISTER OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL AMATEUR WHO SCHEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE INDICATED PATH
5652-39938-0019 THE FINEST ADJUSTMENT HAS TO COME IN DURING THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT OFTEN HAS TO SUGGEST ENTIRELY NEW LINES OF PROCEDURE
5652-39938-0020 MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
5652-39938-0021 SUBTLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PERSONAL NEEDS AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE PSYCHICAL FACTOR IS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE
5652-39938-0022 IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE ONE GREAT OBSTACLE IN THE WORK OF THE ROUTINE PHYSICIAN IS THE LACK OF TIME AND PATIENCE WHICH IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS IS ALWAYS QUICKER THAN TO INFLUENCE THE MIND
5652-39938-0023 THE FIRST METHOD TO BRING BACK THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0024 NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
5652-39938-0025 IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WIDEST MEANING THIS WOULD EVIDENTLY INCLUDE EVERY POSSIBLE MEDICAL TASK FROM FILLING A PAINFUL TOOTH TO OPERATING ON A PAINFUL APPENDIX AS IN EVERY CASE WHERE PAIN RESULTS THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM IS DISTURBED BY IT AND THE NORMAL MENTAL LIFE OF THE PATIENT REDUCED IN ITS EFFICIENCY
5652-39938-0026 GROWTHS IN THE NOSE MAY BE OPERATED UPON THE ASTIGMATIC OR THE SHORT SIGHTED EYE MAY BE CORRECTED BY GLASSES THE CHILD WHO IS HARD OF HEARING MAY AT LEAST BE SEATED NEAR THE TEACHER AND THE BACKWARD CHILDREN QUICKLY REACH THE AVERAGE LEVEL
5652-39938-0027 NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
5652-39938-0028 ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGESTIVE AND SEXUAL SPHERES ARE SOURCES OF IRRITATION WHICH SLOWLY INFLUENCE THE WHOLE PERSONALITY
5652-39938-0029 TO BE SURE THE BRAIN DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE MERE REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL AFFLICTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REINSTATE THE NORMAL BALANCE OF MENTAL ENERGIES BUT WHEREVER SUCH A BODILY IRRITATION GOES ON IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO ABOLISH IT IN THE INTERESTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
5652-39938-0030 HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
5652-39938-0031 OFTEN WITHIN A SURPRISINGLY SHORT TIME THE BRAIN GATHERS THE ENERGIES TO OVERCOME THE FRICTIONS WITH UNAVOIDABLE SURROUNDINGS YET HERE THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO ADJUST THE PRESCRIBED DOSE OF OUTING VERY CAREFULLY TO THE SPECIAL CASE
5652-39938-0032 WE MAY BE GUIDED BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INTEREST OF TESTING THE FATIGUE INDUCED BY MENTAL WORK
5652-39938-0033 IF PERHAPS FOUR HOURS OF CONCENTRATED WORK ARE DONE WITHOUT PAUSES EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK DETERIORATES MEASURED FOR INSTANCE BY THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IN QUICK CALCULATION
5652-39938-0034 THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO FIND THE MIDDLE WAY BETWEEN A TEMPORARY REMOVAL OF IRRITATION WHICH REALLY ALLOWS A DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ENERGIES AND A MERE INTERRUPTION WHICH SIMPLY DAMAGES THE ACQUIRED RELATIVE ADJUSTMENT
5652-39938-0035 EVERY CAUSE OF FRICTION WHICH CAN BE PERMANENTLY ANNIHILATED FOR THE PATIENT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS NEGATIVE REMEDY DEMANDS ITS POSITIVE SUPPLEMENT
5652-39938-0036 THE PATIENT MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONDITIONS AND INFLUENCES WHICH GIVE FAIR CHANCES FOR THE RECUPERATION OF HIS ENERGIES TOO OFTEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE PRESCRIPTION IS SIMPLY REST
5652-39938-0037 AS FAR AS REST INVOLVES SLEEP IT IS CERTAINLY THE IDEAL PRESCRIPTION THERE IS NO OTHER INFLUENCE WHICH BUILDS UP THE INJURED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AS SAFELY AS SOUND NATURAL SLEEP
5652-39938-0038 AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
5652-39938-0039 IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
5652-39938-0040 THE WILD CHASE FOR LUXURY IN THE HIGHER CLASSES REENFORCED BY THE COMMERCIALISM OF OUR TIME THE HARD AND MONOTONOUS LABOR IN OUR MODERN MILLS AND MINES FOR THE LOWER CLASSES
5652-39938-0041 THE OVER EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO EVERYBODY BY THE SENSATIONALISM OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE ALL INJURE THE BRAIN CELLS AND DAMAGE THE EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0042 THAT IS A STORY WHICH WE HEAR A THOUSAND TIMES NOWADAYS YET IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE IS REALLY MUCH TRUTH IN SUCH A CLAIM AND WHETHER MUCH WISE PSYCHOTHERAPY CAN BE DEDUCED FROM IT
5652-39938-0043 WE MAY BEGIN EVEN WITH THE VERY JUSTIFIABLE DOUBT WHETHER NERVOUSNESS REALLY HAS INCREASED IN OUR TIME EARLIER PERIODS HAD NOT SO MANY NAMES FOR THOSE SYMPTOMS AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE THEM WITH THE SAME CLEARNESS
5652-39938-0044 EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
5652-39938-0045 EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
5652-39938-0046 THE PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC HYGIENE HAS BROUGHT EVERYONE MUCH NEARER TO A HARMONIOUS FUNCTIONING OF THE ORGANISM AND THE PROGRESS OF TECHNIQUE HAS REMOVED INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE PLAY OF LIFE
5652-39938-0047 OF COURSE WE STAND TODAY BEFORE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SURROUNDING THAN OUR ANCESTORS BUT STILL MORE QUICKLY THAN THE COMPLEXITY HAVE GROWN THE MEANS TO MASTER IT
5652-39938-0048 THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
5652-39938-0049 MOREOVER OUR LIFE HAS PROBABLY BECOME COOLER THERE IS LESS EMOTIONALISM LESS SENTIMENTALITY MORE BUSINESS LIKE ATTITUDE AND THAT ALL MEANS LESS INNER FRICTION AND EXCITEMENT IN PUBLIC LIFE TOO LESS FEAR OF WAR AND LESS RELIGIOUS STRUGGLE
5652-39938-0050 ABOVE ALL THE INTENSITY OF MENTAL STIMULI IS ALWAYS RELATIVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST KNOWS THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH DETERMINE THAT WE PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE OF IMPRESSIONS AS ALIKE WHEN THE STIMULI ARE PROPORTIONAL
5652-39938-0051 IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
5652-39938-0052 YET THAT QUIET COUNTRYMAN MAY REACT IN HIS NARROW SYSTEM NOT LESS WHEN THE MODEST CHANGES IN HIS SURROUNDINGS PROVOKE HIM THE GOSSIP OF HIS NEIGHBOR MAY UNDERMINE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JUST AS MUCH AS A POLITICAL FIGHT OR THE STRUGGLES OF THE EXCHANGE THAT OF THE CITY MAN
5652-39938-0053 EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE ESTIMATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE STANDARD OF THE PARTICULAR CASE THIS RELATIVITY OF THE MENTAL REACTION ON THE DEMANDS OF LIFE MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC REGIME
5652-39938-0054 SIMPLY TO WITHDRAW A PATIENT FROM THE ONE KIND OF LIFE
5652-39938-0055 COMPLETE REST FOR INSTANCE FOR A HARD BRAIN WORKER HARDLY OUGHT TO BE RECOMMENDED UNLESS A HIGH DEGREE OF EXHAUSTION HAS COME ON IF ROUTINE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE TO BE ADMITTED AT ALL
5652-39938-0056 THEY SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETE REST OR COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT A CONTINUATION OF THE LIFE FOR WHICH ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN LEARNED WITH A REASONABLE REDUCTION OF THE DEMANDS AND STIMULATIONS
5652-39938-0057 THE INTELLECTUAL WORKER OUGHT TO DECREASE HIS WORK THE OVERBUSY SOCIETY WOMAN OUGHT TO STAY IN BED ONE DAY IN THE WEEK THE MAN IN THE MIDST OF THE RUSH OF LIFE OUGHT TO CUT DOWN HIS OBLIGATIONS
5652-39938-0058 BUT PROBABLY EACH OF THEM DOES BETTER TO GO ON THAN SIMPLY TO SWEAR OFF ALTOGETHER THEIR REST OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHARACTER OF VACATION THAT MEANS INTERRUPTIONS WITHOUT THE USUAL ACTIVITY OUGHT TO BE SHORT PERIODS SPENT WITH THE DISTINCT FEELING
5652-39938-0059 THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
5652-39938-0060 STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
5652-39938-0061 BY FAR THE BEST ALTERATION IS THEREFORE EVEN IN THE PERIODS OF INTERRUPTION NOT SIMPLY REST BUT NEW ENGAGEMENTS WHICH AWAKEN NEW INTERESTS AND STIMULATE NEGLECTED MENTAL FACTORS DISBURDENING THE OVER STRAINED ELEMENTS OF MENTAL LIFE
5652-39938-0062 THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENCY FOR THIS TASK IS CONTACT WITH BEAUTY BEAUTY IN NATURE AND LIFE BEAUTY IN ART AND LITERATURE AND MUSIC
5652-39938-0063 TO ENJOY A LANDSCAPE OUGHT TO BE NOT MERELY A NEGATIVE REST FOR THE MAN OF THE OFFICE BUILDING AND GOOD LITERATURE OR MUSIC ABSORBS THE MENTAL ENERGIES AND HARMONIZES THEM
5652-39938-0064 IN THE SECOND PLACE COME GAMES AND SPORT WHICH MAY ENTER INTO THEIR RIGHT IF FATIGUE CAN BE AVOIDED HARMONIOUS JOYFUL COMPANY AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE DEPRESSING COMPANY OF THE SANITARIUMS WILL ADD ITS PLEASANTNESS
5652-39938-0065 WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
5652-39938-0066 EVERYTHING IS TO BE AVOIDED WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
289-121665-0000 AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
289-121665-0001 AND STARTED OUT WITH HER SHEEP THAT THEY MIGHT FEED UPON THE TENDER JUICY GRASSES WITH WHICH THE HILLS ABOUNDED THE LITTLE GIRL USUALLY ACCOMPANIED HER MOTHER AND SAT BY HER SIDE
289-121665-0002 UPON THE GRASSY MOUNDS AND WATCHED HER CARE FOR THE EWES AND LAMBS SO THAT IN TIME SHE HERSELF GREW TO BE A VERY PROFICIENT SHEPHERDESS SO WHEN THE MOTHER BECAME TOO OLD AND FEEBLE TO LEAVE HER COTTAGE LITTLE BO PEEP AS SHE WAS CALLED
289-121665-0003 DECIDED THAT SHE WAS FULLY ABLE TO MANAGE THE FLOCKS HERSELF SHE WAS A LITTLE MITE OF A CHILD WITH FLOWING NUT BROWN LOCKS AND BIG GRAY EYES THAT CHARMED ALL WHO GAZED INTO THEIR INNOCENT DEPTHS SHE WORE A LIGHT GRAY FROCK
289-121665-0004 FASTENED ABOUT THE WAIST WITH A PRETTY PINK SASH AND THERE WERE WHITE RUFFLES AROUND HER NECK AND PINK RIBBONS IN HER HAIR ALL THE SHEPHERDS AND SHEPHERDESSES UPON THE HILLS BOTH YOUNG AND OLD SOON CAME TO KNOW LITTLE BO PEEP VERY WELL INDEED
289-121665-0005 AND THERE WERE MANY WILLING HANDS TO AID HER IF WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN SHE NEEDED THEIR ASSISTANCE BO PEEP USUALLY TOOK HER SHEEP TO THE SIDE OF A HIGH HILL ABOVE THE COTTAGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO EAT THE RICH GRASS WHILE SHE HERSELF SAT UPON A MOUND AND
289-121665-0006 LAYING ASIDE HER CROOK AND HER BROAD STRAW HAT WITH ITS PINK RIBBONS DEVOTED HER TIME TO SEWING AND MENDING STOCKINGS FOR HER AGED MOTHER ONE DAY WHILE THUS OCCUPIED
289-121665-0007 GOOD MORNING LITTLE BO PEEP AND LOOKING UP THE GIRL SAW A WOMAN STANDING NEAR HER AND LEANING UPON A SHORT STICK SHE WAS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE BY WEIGHT OF MANY YEARS HER HAIR WAS WHITE AS SNOW AND HER EYES AS BLACK AS COALS
289-121665-0008 DEEP WRINKLES SEAMED HER FACE AND HANDS WHILE HER NOSE AND CHIN WERE SO POINTED THAT THEY NEARLY MET SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK UPON BUT BO PEEP HAD LEARNED TO BE POLITE TO THE AGED SO SHE ANSWERED SWEETLY
289-121665-0009 GOOD MORNING MOTHER CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU NO DEARIE RETURNED THE WOMAN IN A CRACKED VOICE BUT I WILL SIT BY YOUR SIDE AND REST FOR A TIME THE GIRL MADE ROOM ON THE MOUND BESIDE HER
289-121665-0010 AND THE STRANGER SAT DOWN AND WATCHED IN SILENCE THE BUSY FINGERS SEW UP THE SEAMS OF THE NEW FROCK SHE WAS MAKING BY AND BY THE WOMAN ASKED WHY DO YOU COME OUT HERE TO SEW BECAUSE I AM A SHEPHERDESS REPLIED THE GIRL
289-121665-0011 BUT WHERE IS YOUR CROOK ON THE GRASS BESIDE ME AND WHERE ARE YOUR SHEEP BO PEEP LOOKED UP AND COULD NOT SEE THEM THEY MUST HAVE STRAYED OVER THE TOP OF THE HILL SHE SAID AND I WILL GO AND SEEK THEM
289-121665-0012 DO NOT BE IN A HURRY CROAKED THE OLD WOMAN THEY WILL RETURN PRESENTLY WITHOUT YOUR TROUBLING TO FIND THEM DO YOU THINK SO ASKED BO PEEP OF COURSE DO NOT THE SHEEP KNOW YOU
289-121665-0013 OH YES THEY KNOW ME EVERY ONE AND DO NOT YOU KNOW THE SHEEP I CAN CALL EVERY ONE BY NAME SAID BO PEEP CONFIDENTLY FOR THOUGH I AM SO YOUNG A SHEPHERDESS I AM FOND OF MY SHEEP AND KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM
289-121665-0014 THE OLD WOMAN CHUCKLED SOFTLY AS IF THE ANSWER AMUSED HER AND REPLIED NO ONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING MY DEAR BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT MY SHEEP PROTESTED LITTLE BO PEEP DO YOU INDEED
289-121665-0015 THEN YOU ARE WISER THAT MOST PEOPLE AND IF YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM YOU ALSO KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL ALL BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AS USUAL
289-121665-0016 OH SAID LITTLE BO PEEP IN SURPRISE DO THEY WAG THEIR TAILS I NEVER NOTICED THAT INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN THEN YOU ARE NOT VERY OBSERVING FOR ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT SHEEP
289-121665-0017 PERHAPS YOU HAVE NEVER NOTICED THEIR TAILS AT ALL NO ANSWERED BO PEEP THOUGHTFULLY I DO N'T KNOW THAT I EVER HAVE THE WOMAN LAUGHED SO HARD AT THIS REPLY
289-121665-0018 THAT SHE BEGAN TO COUGH AND THIS MADE THE GIRL REMEMBER THAT HER FLOCK HAD STRAYED AWAY I REALLY MUST GO AND FIND MY SHEEP SHE SAID RISING TO HER FEET AND THEN I SHALL BE SURE TO NOTICE THEIR TAILS AND SEE IF THEY WAG THEM SIT STILL MY CHILD
289-121665-0019 SAID THE OLD WOMAN I AM GOING OVER THE HILL TOP MYSELF AND I WILL SEND THE SHEEP BACK TO YOU SO SHE GOT UPON HER FEET AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL AND THE GIRL HEARD HER SAYING AS SHE WALKED AWAY LITTLE BO PEEP HAS LOST HER SHEEP
289-121665-0020 AND DOES N'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND EM BUT LEAVE EM ALONE AND THEY LL COME HOME ALL WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND EM LITTLE BO PEEP SAT STILL AND WATCHED THE OLD WOMAN TOIL SLOWLY UP THE HILL SIDE AND DISAPPEAR OVER THE TOP BY AND BY SHE THOUGHT
289-121665-0021 VERY SOON I SHALL SEE THE SHEEP COMING BACK BUT TIME PASSED AWAY AND STILL THE ERRANT FLOCK FAILED TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SOON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS BEGAN TO NOD
289-121665-0022 LITTLE BO PEEP FELL FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMT SHE HEARD THEM BLEATING BUT WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND IT A JOKE FOR STILL THEY WERE A FLEETING THE GIRL NOW BECAME QUITE ANXIOUS AND WONDERED WHY THE OLD WOMAN HAD NOT DRIVEN HER FLOCK OVER THE HILL
289-121665-0023 BUT AS IT WAS NOW TIME FOR LUNCHEON SHE OPENED HER LITTLE BASKET AND ATE OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE AND COOKIES SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER AFTER SHE HAD FINISHED HER MEAL AND TAKEN A DRINK OF COOL WATER FROM A SPRING NEAR BY
289-121665-0024 SHE DECIDED SHE WOULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER SO UP SHE TOOK HER LITTLE CROOK DETERMINED FOR TO FIND THEM AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP THERE WAS NEVER A SIGHT OF SHEEP ABOUT
289-121665-0025 ONLY A GREEN VALLEY AND ANOTHER HILL BEYOND NOW REALLY ALARMED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER CHARGE BO PEEP HURRIED INTO THE VALLEY AND UP THE FARTHER HILL SIDE PANTING AND TIRED SHE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND PAUSING BREATHLESSLY
289-121665-0026 GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
289-121665-0027 BUT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT AND HELD UP HER LITTLE HANDS WITH A PRETTY EXPRESSION OF DISMAY SHE HAD FOUND THEM INDEED BUT IT MADE HER HEART BLEED
289-121665-0028 NOTHING WAS LEFT TO EACH SHEEP BUT A WEE LITTLE STUMP WHERE A TAIL SHOULD BE AND LITTLE BO PEEP WAS SO HEART BROKEN THAT SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM AND SOBBED BITTERLY
289-121665-0029 BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
289-121665-0030 SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
289-121665-0031 AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AS IF SOMETHING PLEASED HER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS BECOME OF THEIR TAILS ASKED THE GIRL OH SOME ONE HAS PROBABLY CUT THEM OFF THEY MAKE NICE TIPPETS IN WINTER TIME YOU KNOW
289-121665-0032 AND THEN SHE PATTED THE CHILD UPON HER HEAD AND WALKED AWAY DOWN THE VALLEY BO PEEP WAS MUCH GRIEVED OVER THE LOSS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER DEAR SHEEP AND SO DRIVING THEM BEFORE HER SHE WANDERED AROUND TO SEE IF BY ANY CHANCE SHE COULD FIND THE LOST TAILS
289-121665-0033 BUT SOON THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK OVER THE HILL TOPS AND SHE KNEW SHE MUST TAKE HER SHEEP HOME BEFORE NIGHT OVERTOOK THEM SHE DID NOT TELL HER MOTHER OF HER MISFORTUNE FOR SHE FEARED THE OLD SHEPHERDESS WOULD SCOLD HER
289-121665-0034 AND BO PEEP HAD FULLY DECIDED TO SEEK FOR THE TAILS AND FIND THEM BEFORE SHE RELATED THE STORY OF THEIR LOSS TO ANYONE EACH DAY FOR MANY DAYS AFTER THAT LITTLE BO PEEP WANDERED ABOUT THE HILLS SEEKING THE TAILS OF HER SHEEP
289-121665-0035 AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
289-121665-0036 THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
289-121665-0037 AND AFTER PONDERING THE MATTER FOR A TIME SHE BECAME DISCOURAGED AND THINKING SHE WAS NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE THE TAILS WERE FOUND SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND TO BEWAIL HER MISFORTUNE BUT AMIDST HER TEARS SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF HER NEEDLE AND THREAD
289-121665-0038 WHY SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING AGAIN I CAN SEW THEM ON OF COURSE THEN SHE HEAVED A SIGH AND WIPED HER EYE AND RAN O'ER HILL AND DALE OH AND TRIED WHAT SHE COULD AS A SHEPHERDESS SHOULD TO TACK TO EACH SHEEP ITS TAIL OH
289-121665-0039 BUT THE VERY FIRST SHEEP SHE CAME TO REFUSED TO ALLOW HER TO SEW ON THE TAIL AND RAN AWAY FROM HER AND THE OTHERS DID THE SAME SO THAT FINALLY SHE WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN WHEN THE SAME OLD WOMAN SHE HAD BEFORE MET
289-121665-0040 CAME HOBBLING TO HER SIDE AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CAT TAILS YOUR CAT TAILS REPLIED BO PEEP IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THESE TAILS ARE ALL CUT FROM WHITE PUSSYCATS AND I PUT THEM ON THE TREE TO DRY
289-121665-0041 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
289-121665-0042 I MUST HUNT UNTIL I FIND THOSE THAT BELONG TO MY SHEEP MY DEAR SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR SHEEP AND I WANTED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON FOR HOWEVER WISE WE MAY BE
289-121665-0043 NO ONE IN THIS WORLD KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING SHEEP DO NOT HAVE LONG TAILS THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE STUMP TO ANSWER FOR A TAIL NEITHER DO RABBITS HAVE TAILS NOR BEARS NOR MANY OTHER ANIMALS
289-121665-0044 AND IF YOU HAD BEEN OBSERVING YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS WHEN I SAID THE SHEEP WOULD BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED ALL THOSE DAYS IN SEARCHING FOR WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND
289-121665-0045 SO NOW LITTLE ONE RUN AWAY HOME AND TRY TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL IN THE FUTURE YOUR SHEEP WILL NEVER MISS THE TAILS
289-121665-0046 AND NOW LITTLE BO PEEP NO MORE DID WEEP MY TALE OF TAILS ENDS HERE
909-131044-0000 THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET
909-131044-0001 AND TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED UNDER HIS AUSPICES WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT THE LONGER THE DURATION IN OFFICE THE GREATER WILL BE THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING SO IMPORTANT AN ADVANTAGE
909-131044-0002 IT IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT A MAN WILL BE INTERESTED IN WHATEVER HE POSSESSES IN PROPORTION TO THE FIRMNESS OR PRECARIOUSNESS OF THE TENURE BY WHICH HE HOLDS IT
909-131044-0003 AND OF COURSE WILL BE WILLING TO RISK MORE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE THAN FOR THE SAKE OF THE OTHER THIS REMARK IS NOT LESS APPLICABLE TO A POLITICAL PRIVILEGE OR HONOR OR TRUST THAN TO ANY ARTICLE OF ORDINARY PROPERTY
909-131044-0004 THE INFERENCE FROM IT IS THAT A MAN ACTING IN THE CAPACITY OF CHIEF MAGISTRATE UNDER A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS OFFICE WILL BE APT TO FEEL HIMSELF TOO LITTLE INTERESTED IN IT TO HAZARD ANY MATERIAL CENSURE OR PERPLEXITY
909-131044-0005 FROM THE INDEPENDENT EXERTION OF HIS POWERS OR FROM ENCOUNTERING THE ILL HUMORS HOWEVER TRANSIENT WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO PREVAIL EITHER IN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF OR EVEN IN A PREDOMINANT FACTION IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
909-131044-0006 IF THE CASE SHOULD ONLY BE THAT HE MIGHT LAY IT DOWN UNLESS CONTINUED BY A NEW CHOICE AND IF HE SHOULD BE DESIROUS OF BEING CONTINUED HIS WISHES CONSPIRING WITH HIS FEARS WOULD TEND STILL MORE POWERFULLY TO CORRUPT HIS INTEGRITY
909-131044-0007 EITHER IN THE COMMUNITY OR IN THE LEGISLATURE AS ITS BEST RECOMMENDATION BUT SUCH MEN ENTERTAIN VERY CRUDE NOTIONS AS WELL OF THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH GOVERNMENT WAS INSTITUTED AS OF THE TRUE MEANS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC HAPPINESS MAY BE PROMOTED
909-131044-0008 THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE DEMANDS THAT THE DELIBERATE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY SHOULD GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY INTRUST THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR AFFAIRS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN UNQUALIFIED COMPLAISANCE TO EVERY SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION
909-131044-0009 OR TO EVERY TRANSIENT IMPULSE WHICH THE PEOPLE MAY RECEIVE FROM THE ARTS OF MEN WHO FLATTER THEIR PREJUDICES TO BETRAY THEIR INTERESTS IT IS A JUST OBSERVATION THAT THE PEOPLE COMMONLY INTEND THE PUBLIC GOOD
909-131044-0010 THIS OFTEN APPLIES TO THEIR VERY ERRORS BUT THEIR GOOD SENSE WOULD DESPISE THE ADULATOR WHO SHOULD PRETEND THAT THEY ALWAYS REASON RIGHT ABOUT THE MEANS OF PROMOTING IT THEY KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SOMETIMES ERR AND THE WONDER IS
909-131044-0011 THAT THEY SO SELDOM ERR AS THEY DO BESET AS THEY CONTINUALLY ARE BY THE WILES OF PARASITES AND SYCOPHANTS BY THE SNARES OF THE AMBITIOUS THE AVARICIOUS THE DESPERATE BY THE ARTIFICES
909-131044-0012 OF MEN WHO POSSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE MORE THAN THEY DESERVE IT AND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO POSSESS RATHER THAN TO DESERVE IT WHEN OCCASIONS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR INCLINATIONS
909-131044-0013 IN WHICH A CONDUCT OF THIS KIND HAS SAVED THE PEOPLE FROM VERY FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES AND HAS PROCURED LASTING MONUMENTS OF THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE MEN WHO HAD COURAGE AND MAGNANIMITY ENOUGH TO SERVE THEM AT THE PERIL OF THEIR DISPLEASURE
909-131044-0014 BUT HOWEVER INCLINED WE MIGHT BE TO INSIST UPON AN UNBOUNDED COMPLAISANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN WITH NO PROPRIETY CONTEND FOR A LIKE COMPLAISANCE TO THE HUMORS OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0015 THE LATTER MAY SOMETIMES STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE FORMER AND AT OTHER TIMES THE PEOPLE MAY BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN EITHER SUPPOSITION IT IS CERTAINLY DESIRABLE THAT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION TO DARE TO ACT HIS OWN OPINION WITH VIGOR AND DECISION
909-131044-0016 THE SAME RULE WHICH TEACHES THE PROPRIETY OF A PARTITION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF POWER TEACHES US LIKEWISE THAT THIS PARTITION OUGHT TO BE SO CONTRIVED AS TO RENDER THE ONE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER
909-131044-0017 TO WHAT PURPOSE SEPARATE THE EXECUTIVE OR THE JUDICIARY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE IF BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY ARE SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE AT THE ABSOLUTE DEVOTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE SUCH A SEPARATION MUST BE MERELY NOMINAL
909-131044-0018 AND ANOTHER TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE FIRST COMPORTS WITH THE LAST VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION UNITES ALL POWER IN THE SAME HANDS
909-131044-0019 THE TENDENCY OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO ABSORB EVERY OTHER HAS BEEN FULLY DISPLAYED AND ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES IN SOME PRECEDING NUMBERS IN GOVERNMENTS PURELY REPUBLICAN THIS TENDENCY IS ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE
909-131044-0020 THEY OFTEN APPEAR DISPOSED TO EXERT AN IMPERIOUS CONTROL OVER THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AS THEY COMMONLY HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THEIR SIDE
909-131044-0021 THEY ALWAYS ACT WITH SUCH MOMENTUM AS TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED HOW THE SHORTNESS OF THE DURATION IN OFFICE
909-131044-0022 CAN AFFECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ON THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS THE ONE WERE POSSESSED OF THE POWER OF APPOINTING OR DISPLACING THE OTHER ONE ANSWER TO THIS INQUIRY MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY REMARKED
909-131044-0023 THOUGH NOT MORE CONCLUSIVE WILL RESULT FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER THE PEOPLE WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE RE ELECTION OF A MAN WHO BY AN UPRIGHT RESISTANCE TO ANY SINISTER PROJECT OF THAT BODY SHOULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF
909-131044-0024 OBNOXIOUS TO ITS RESENTMENT IT MAY BE ASKED ALSO WHETHER A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WOULD ANSWER THE END PROPOSED AND IF IT WOULD NOT WHETHER A LESS PERIOD WHICH WOULD AT LEAST BE RECOMMENDED BY GREATER SECURITY AGAINST AMBITIOUS DESIGNS
909-131044-0025 WOULD NOT FOR THAT REASON BE PREFERABLE TO A LONGER PERIOD WHICH WAS AT THE SAME TIME TOO SHORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPIRING THE DESIRED FIRMNESS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS OR ANY OTHER LIMITED DURATION
909-131044-0026 THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL IN WHICH THE PROSPECT OF ANNIHILATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE NOT TO HAVE AN IMPROPER EFFECT UPON THE CONDUCT OF A MAN INDUED WITH A TOLERABLE PORTION OF FORTITUDE
909-131044-0027 AND IN WHICH HE MIGHT REASONABLY PROMISE HIMSELF THAT THERE WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE IT ARRIVED TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY SENSIBLE OF THE PROPRIETY OF THE MEASURES HE MIGHT INCLINE TO PURSUE THOUGH IT BE PROBABLE THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE MOMENT
909-131044-0028 OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF IN THE ESTEEM AND GOOD WILL OF HIS CONSTITUENTS HE MIGHT THEN HAZARD WITH SAFETY IN PROPORTION TO THE PROOFS HE HAD GIVEN OF HIS WISDOM AND INTEGRITY AND TO THE TITLE HE HAD ACQUIRED TO THE RESPECT AND ATTACHMENT OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS
909-131044-0029 AS ON THE ONE HAND A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE EXECUTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO RENDER IT A VERY VALUABLE INGREDIENT IN THE COMPOSITION SO ON THE OTHER IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY ALARM FOR THE PUBLIC LIBERTY
909-131044-0030 IF A BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM THE MOST FEEBLE BEGINNINGS FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX
909-131044-0031 HAVE BY RAPID STRIDES REDUCED THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN AND THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NOBILITY WITHIN THE LIMITS THEY CONCEIVED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WHILE THEY RAISED THEMSELVES TO THE RANK AND CONSEQUENCE OF A COEQUAL BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0032 ALL THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL IN THE CHURCH AS STATE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE ON A RECENT OCCASION TO MAKE THE MONARCH TREMBLE AT THE PROSPECT
909-131044-0033 WHAT BUT THAT HE MIGHT BE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK WHICH THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS HIM I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT IF HIS DURATION BE SUCH AS TO LEAVE A DOUBT OF HIS FIRMNESS THAT DOUBT IS INCONSISTENT WITH A JEALOUSY OF HIS ENCROACHMENTS
909-131045-0000 THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS LARGEST SENSE COMPREHENDS ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BODY POLITIC WHETHER LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIARY BUT IN ITS MOST USUAL AND PERHAPS ITS MOST PRECISE SIGNIFICATION
909-131045-0001 IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
909-131045-0002 THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
909-131045-0003 THESE AND OTHER MATTERS OF A LIKE NATURE CONSTITUTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOST PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT THE PERSONS THEREFORE TO WHOSE IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT THESE DIFFERENT MATTERS ARE COMMITTED
909-131045-0004 OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
909-131045-0005 THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
909-131045-0006 THE PERSON SUBSTITUTED IS WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING THAT THE DISMISSION OF HIS PREDECESSOR HAS PROCEEDED FROM A DISLIKE TO HIS MEASURES AND THAT THE LESS HE RESEMBLES HIM THE MORE HE WILL RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO THE FAVOR OF HIS CONSTITUENTS
909-131045-0007 THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
909-131045-0008 AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
909-131045-0009 THE FIRST IS NECESSARY TO GIVE TO THE OFFICER HIMSELF THE INCLINATION AND THE RESOLUTION TO ACT HIS PART WELL AND TO THE COMMUNITY TIME AND LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE TENDENCY OF HIS MEASURES AND THENCE TO FORM AN EXPERIMENTAL ESTIMATE OF THEIR MERITS
909-131045-0010 THE LAST IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE REASON TO APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT TO CONTINUE HIM IN HIS STATION IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE UTILITY OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES AND TO SECURE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE ADVANTAGE OF PERMANENCY
909-131045-0011 IN A WISE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION NOTHING APPEARS MORE PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT NOR MORE ILL FOUNDED UPON CLOSE INSPECTION THAN A SCHEME WHICH IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT POINT HAS HAD SOME RESPECTABLE ADVOCATES I MEAN
909-131045-0012 THAT OF CONTINUING THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN EXCLUDING HIM FROM IT EITHER FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OR FOREVER AFTER THIS EXCLUSION WHETHER TEMPORARY OR PERPETUAL WOULD HAVE NEARLY THE SAME EFFECTS
909-131045-0013 WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATION WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED MUST BE RELINQUISHED AT A DETERMINATE PERIOD THAN WHEN THEY WERE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF OBTAINING
909-131045-0014 IS TO MAKE THEIR INTERESTS COINCIDE WITH THEIR DUTY EVEN THE LOVE OF FAME THE RULING PASSION OF THE NOBLEST MINDS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A MAN TO PLAN AND UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE AND ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT
909-131045-0015 AND MUST COMMIT THAT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN REPUTATION TO HANDS WHICH MIGHT BE UNEQUAL OR UNFRIENDLY TO THE TASK THE MOST TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE GENERALITY OF MEN IN SUCH A SITUATION IS THE NEGATIVE MERIT OF NOT DOING HARM
909-131045-0016 INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
909-131045-0017 AN AVARICIOUS MAN WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FILL THE OFFICE LOOKING FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HE MUST AT ALL EVENTS YIELD UP THE EMOLUMENTS HE ENJOYED WOULD FEEL A PROPENSITY NOT EASY TO BE RESISTED BY SUCH A MAN
909-131045-0018 TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE ENJOYED WHILE IT LASTED AND MIGHT NOT SCRUPLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MOST CORRUPT EXPEDIENTS TO MAKE THE HARVEST AS ABUNDANT AS IT WAS TRANSITORY THOUGH THE SAME MAN PROBABLY WITH A DIFFERENT PROSPECT BEFORE HIM
909-131045-0019 MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
909-131045-0020 ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
909-131045-0021 BUT WITH THE PROSPECT BEFORE HIM OF APPROACHING AN INEVITABLE ANNIHILATION HIS AVARICE WOULD BE LIKELY TO GET THE VICTORY OVER HIS CAUTION HIS VANITY OR HIS AMBITION AN AMBITIOUS MAN TOO
909-131045-0022 WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE SUMMIT OF HIS COUNTRY'S HONORS WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE MUST DESCEND FROM THE EXALTED EMINENCE FOR EVER AND REFLECTED THAT NO EXERTION OF MERIT ON HIS PART COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE UNWELCOME REVERSE
909-131045-0023 AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
909-131045-0024 IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE THAT EXPERIENCE IS THE PARENT OF WISDOM IS AN ADAGE THE TRUTH OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY THE WISEST AS WELL AS THE SIMPLEST OF MANKIND WHAT MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN THIS QUALITY IN THE GOVERNORS OF NATIONS
909-131045-0025 WHERE MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IN THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A NATION CAN IT BE WISE TO PUT THIS DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITY UNDER THE BAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND TO DECLARE THAT THE MOMENT IT IS ACQUIRED ITS POSSESSOR SHALL BE COMPELLED
909-131045-0026 TO ABANDON THE STATION IN WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED AND TO WHICH IT IS ADAPTED THIS NEVERTHELESS IS THE PRECISE IMPORT OF ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH EXCLUDE MEN FROM SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
909-131045-0027 BY THE CHOICE OF THEIR FELLOWCITIZENS AFTER THEY HAVE BY A COURSE OF SERVICE FITTED THEMSELVES FOR DOING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF UTILITY A FOURTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE BANISHING MEN FROM STATIONS IN WHICH
909-131045-0028 IN CERTAIN EMERGENCIES OF THE STATE THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR SAFETY THERE IS NO NATION WHICH HAS NOT AT ONE PERIOD OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE SERVICES OF PARTICULAR MEN
909-131045-0029 IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY TO THE PRESERVATION OF ITS POLITICAL EXISTENCE HOW UNWISE THEREFORE MUST BE EVERY SUCH SELF DENYING ORDINANCE AS SERVES TO PROHIBIT A NATION FROM MAKING USE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS
909-131045-0030 IN THE MANNER BEST SUITED TO ITS EXIGENCIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SUPPOSING THE PERSONAL ESSENTIALITY OF THE MAN IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CHANGE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A WAR OR AT ANY SIMILAR CRISIS FOR ANOTHER
909-131045-0031 EVEN OF EQUAL MERIT WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD SUBSTITUTE INEXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE AND WOULD TEND TO UNHINGE AND SET AFLOAT THE ALREADY SETTLED TRAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
909-131045-0032 A FIFTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD OPERATE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL INTERDICTION OF STABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION BY NECESSITATING A CHANGE OF MEN IN THE FIRST OFFICE OF THE NATION
909-131045-0033 IT WOULD NECESSITATE A MUTABILITY OF MEASURES IT IS NOT GENERALLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT MEN WILL VARY AND MEASURES REMAIN UNIFORM THE CONTRARY IS THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS
909-131045-0034 AND WE NEED NOT BE APPREHENSIVE THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH STABILITY WHILE THERE IS EVEN THE OPTION OF CHANGING NOR NEED WE DESIRE TO PROHIBIT THE PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING THEIR CONFIDENCE WHERE THEY THINK IT MAY BE SAFELY PLACED AND WHERE BY CONSTANCY ON THEIR PART
909-131045-0035 THEY MAY OBVIATE THE FATAL INCONVENIENCES OF FLUCTUATING COUNCILS AND A VARIABLE POLICY THESE ARE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD FLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUSION THEY APPLY MOST FORCIBLY TO THE SCHEME OF A PERPETUAL EXCLUSION
909-131045-0036 BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
909-131045-0037 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
909-131045-0038 UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
909-131045-0039 ON THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HE NOT ONLY MAY BUT MUST BE EXPOSED TO THEIR RESENTMENTS UPON AN EQUAL PERHAPS UPON AN INFERIOR FOOTING IT IS NOT AN EASY POINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE MOST PROMOTED OR IMPAIRED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
909-131045-0040 AS TO THE SECOND SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE THERE IS STILL GREATER REASON TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS CONCERNING IT IF THE EXCLUSION WERE TO BE PERPETUAL A MAN OF IRREGULAR AMBITION OF WHOM ALONE THERE COULD BE REASON IN ANY CASE TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSION
909-131045-0041 WOULD WITH INFINITE RELUCTANCE YIELD TO THE NECESSITY OF TAKING HIS LEAVE FOREVER OF A POST IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR POWER AND PRE EMINENCE HAD ACQUIRED THE FORCE OF HABIT AND IF HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE
909-131045-0042 THERE MAY BE CONCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS DISGUST OF THE PEOPLE SECONDING THE THWARTED AMBITION OF SUCH A FAVORITE MIGHT OCCASION GREATER DANGER TO LIBERTY THAN COULD EVER REASONABLY BE DREADED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERPETUATION IN OFFICE
909-131045-0043 BY THE VOLUNTARY SUFFRAGES OF THE COMMUNITY EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF REFINEMENT IN THE IDEA OF DISABLING THE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE MEN WHO HAD ENTITLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR OPINION
78-369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
78-369-0001 MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
78-369-0002 I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
78-369-0003 ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
78-369-0004 AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
78-369-0005 UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
78-369-0006 AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
78-369-0007 AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
78-369-0008 THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
78-369-0009 ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
78-369-0010 WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
78-369-0011 DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
78-369-0012 HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
78-369-0013 IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
78-369-0014 AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
78-369-0015 I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
78-369-0016 SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
78-369-0017 SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
78-369-0018 THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
78-369-0019 WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
78-369-0020 THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
78-369-0021 AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
78-369-0022 I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
78-369-0023 OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
78-369-0024 DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
78-369-0025 HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
78-369-0026 AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
78-369-0027 AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
78-369-0028 AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
78-369-0029 THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
78-369-0030 WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
78-369-0031 AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
78-369-0032 THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
78-369-0033 AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
78-369-0034 ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
78-369-0035 WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
78-369-0036 AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
78-369-0037 OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
78-369-0038 THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
78-369-0039 AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
78-369-0040 SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
78-369-0041 AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
78-369-0042 CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
78-369-0043 THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
78-369-0044 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0045 AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
78-369-0046 MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
78-369-0047 I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
78-369-0048 WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
78-369-0049 I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
78-369-0050 DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
78-369-0051 GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
78-369-0052 WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
78-369-0053 WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
78-369-0054 WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
78-369-0055 MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
78-369-0056 AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
78-369-0057 AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
78-369-0058 SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
78-369-0059 I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
78-369-0060 BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
78-369-0061 OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO
78-369-0062 SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
78-369-0063 SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
1970-26100-0000 HER WILLINGNESS TO BREAK OUR FRIENDSHIP AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY GAVE ME LITTLE ROOM TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT SHE SHOULD RISK HER REPUTATION TO RUN AFTER THAT MAN WAS INEXPLICABLE BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE A WOMAN
1970-26100-0001 IF SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT ME I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT HER I'M THE EASIEST GOING PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING THE GIRL YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED TO TO MAKE A FOOL OF HERSELF OVER ANOTHER MAN I WON'T STAND FOR IT
1970-26100-0002 AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME AN AWFULLY GOOD REASON FOR HER SUDDEN INTEREST IN FRANK WOODS BEFORE I WOULD FORGIVE HER THESE THOUGHTS HELD MY ATTENTION ALL THE WAY OUT
1970-26100-0003 NOW AND AGAIN I WOULD BE RECALLED FROM MY GLOOM BY SOME QUESTION FROM THE CORONER HE WAS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF WHO MURDERED JIM
1970-26100-0004 AS WE NEARED THE BRIDGE I NOTICED AGAIN HOW SCANT THE VEGETATION WAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD ANY ONE WISHING TO MURDER JIM WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE HIM COMING
1970-26100-0005 COULD BE SEEN THE THIRTEENTH HOLE OF THE COUNTRY CLUB GOLF LINKS WHEN WE REACHED THE CREST OF THE HILL LEADING DOWN TO THE BRIDGE OUR EYES AT ONCE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A TALL MAPLE TREE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM IT
1970-26100-0006 AS HE SAW IT THE CORONER GAVE A GRUNT OF SATISFACTION THERE'S OUR TREE WE STOPPED THE CAR AND SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE THORNY BUSHES THAT LINED THE ROAD THE GROUND WAS HARD CLAY WITH ONLY BURDOCK AND WEEDS GROWING ON IT
1970-26100-0007 THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE WHEN WE REACHED THE TREE THE CORONER EXAMINED THE GROUND AROUND IT CAREFULLY WHEN HE AROSE HE SEEMED DISAPPOINTED WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND HERE I ASKED
1970-26100-0008 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE MIGHT FIND IF THE MAN WHO FIRED THOSE SHOTS USED THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE MIGHT FIND AN EMPTY CARTRIDGE OR TWO THERE OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST SOME BROKEN TWIGS OR SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS UP THERE BUT I FIND NOTHING AT ALL
1970-26100-0009 STILL THE FACT THAT THE TREE IS WHERE IT IS MAKES THE THEORY PLAUSIBLE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NOW THAT I'VE SEEN HOW FAR WE ARE FROM THE ROAD I DON'T THINK IT DOES
1970-26100-0010 THOSE BULLET HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE CAR WERE FIRED FROM ABOVE AND BEHIND THE MACHINE THEY SLANTED DOWN BUT NOT SIDEWISE
1970-26100-0011 BUT IF THE MURDERER USED THIS TREE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ROAD HE WOULD HAVE STARTED FIRING BEFORE THE CAR CAME OPPOSITE
1970-26100-0012 I'M SORRY FOR WHEN I SAW THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE'D STRUCK THE RIGHT TRACK THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T MAKE OUT I STATED AND THAT IS THE STRANGE CRY OF MY SISTER IN HER DELIRIUM LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US SHE CALLED OUT
1970-26100-0013 AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO SWEAR IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THE CORONER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN TURNED TO ME WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY NOTHING THAT SEEMED TO REFER TO THE ACCIDENT ALL THE REST WAS APPARENTLY DELIRIUM
1970-26100-0014 SHE BEGGED FORGIVENESS FOR SOME FANCIED WRONG AND REPEATED THAT A CERTAIN MAN WAS NOT GUILTY OF DISHONESTY BUT HER FIRST WEIRD CRY HAD TO DO WITH THE MURDER I'M SURE
1970-26100-0015 EVERYTHING POINTS TO AN AEROPLANE IT WAS DONE A HUNDRED YES A THOUSAND TIMES IN THE WAR WHILE I WAS OVER THERE WITH MY HOSPITAL UNIT WE USED TO GET A LOT OF CASES OF MOTORCYCLE DESPATCH RIDERS WHO HAD BEEN PICKED OFF BY GERMAN AVIATORS
1970-26100-0016 AND IS THE HEAD OF AN AEROPLANE FIRM BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAS AN AEROPLANE HERE HE COULD GET ONE EASY ENOUGH THE CLEVER DEVIL LOOK OVER THERE HE HAD THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE GOLF COURSE AS A PERFECT LANDING GROUND
1970-26100-0017 HELPLESS BEFORE APPROACHING DEATH I COULD IMAGINE HELEN'S AGONY AS SHE SAW THAT DIM BLACK SHAPE
1970-26100-0018 LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US YES BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE IT I ASKED THAT'S UP TO US NOW AN AEROPLANE HAS SUCH SPEED THAT IT WAS EASY FOR WOODS TO FASHION AN INGENIOUS ALIBI
1970-26100-0019 TO ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF HIS TIME ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER BUT THERE MUST BE SOME HOLES IN IT THERE ALWAYS IS IN A MANUFACTURED ALIBI I WANT YOU TO GO OVER TO THE COUNTRY CLUB AND CHECK UP MISTER WOODS SCHEDULE OF THAT NIGHT
1970-26100-0020 WHILE I EXAMINE THE GOLF LINKS TO SEE IF HE LANDED THERE WE JUMPED INTO MY CAR AND DROVE RAPIDLY TO THE CLUB I WENT INTO THE HOUSE BY THE BACK WAY TO AVOID MEETING PEOPLE AND ASKED FOR JACKSON
1970-26100-0021 JACKSON WHAT TIME DID MISTER WOODS GET OUT HERE ON THE EVENING MISTER FELDERSON WAS KILLED
1970-26100-0022 DID YOU SEE HIM AT THAT TIME

1970-26100-0025 I ASKED THE BOY WAS TREMBLING HE ROLLED FRIGHTENED EYES TOWARD JACKSON WHO WAS GLARING AT HIM FINALLY HE BROKE INTO A WAIL
1970-26100-0026 MOTIONING THE ANGRY JACKSON AWAY HE HE SET DOWN AT DE TABLE BUT HE AIN'T EAT NONE THE BOY STUTTERED WHAT DO YOU MEAN GEORGE

1970-26100-0032 ARE YOU SURE MISTER WOODS WAS IN HERE WELL NO SIR NOT EXACTLY I REMEMBER MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN THERE WERE PROBABLY SOME OTHERS THE REASON I THINK MISTER WOODS WAS HERE
1970-26100-0033 WAS BECAUSE HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE FACT A FEW NIGHTS AFTER THE MURDER THERE WERE A FEW GENTLEMEN IN HERE AND THEY WERE TALKING OF MISTER FELDERSON'S DEATH MISTER WOODS SAID IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE MURDERER HADN'T BEEN FOUND
1970-26100-0034 ALMOST ANY ONE MIGHT BE ACCUSED SOME ONE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS WORRIED WE ALL KNEW SIR THAT MISTER FELDERSON AND MISTER WOODS WERE NOT VERY FRIENDLY AND MISTER WOODS LAUGHED AND SAID THAT FORTUNATELY HE HAD A PERFECT ALIBI
1970-26100-0035 OH HIS ALIBI IS GOOD OF COURSE BECAUSE HE WAS AROUND THE CLUB ALL THAT EVENING I GUESS HE WAS HERE AND I DON'T REMEMBER IT I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND LEFT FAR OUT ON THE GOLF LINKS THE CORONER WAS BENDING OVER EXAMINING SOMETHING ON THE GROUND
1970-26100-0036 PARALLELING EACH OTHER FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YARDS
1970-28415-0000 THEY UNTIED IT AND LED IT AWAY SOME OF THEM PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON THE DONKEY'S BACK FOR A KING MUST RIDE IN COMFORT OTHERS SPREAD THEIR CLOTHES OUT ON THE STREET FOR A KING SHOULD RIDE IN STATE
1970-28415-0001 JESUS GOT ON THE DONKEY AND STARTED FOR JERUSALEM THE DISCIPLES WALKED AHEAD WHEN THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED THE CITY THE DISCIPLES BEGAN TO SHOUT JESUS USED TO SAY THAT THEY MUST NOT TELL ANYONE THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
1970-28415-0002 BUT NOW THEY COULD TELL THE WHOLE WORLD FOR JESUS WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE QUIET ANY LONGER
1970-28415-0003 AND WAS A CRY OF WELCOME THEY SHOUTED THE WORDS OF A PSALM HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID
1970-28415-0004 HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST THE CITY WAS CROWDED WITH TRAVELERS FROM ALL OVER PALESTINE AND FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TOO THEY WERE THE PILGRIMS WHO HAD COME FOR THE PASSOVER FEAST THE CROWDS SAW THE PROCESSION COMING THEY SAW THE DONKEY
1970-28415-0005 SOME OF THE CROWDS BEGAN TO SHOUT WITH THE DISCIPLES A GREAT CRY OF HOSANNA WENT RINGING DOWN THE STREET EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IT
1970-28415-0006 SOME CUT BRANCHES FROM THE TREES AND WAVED THEM BEFORE THE MESSIAH IT WAS A ROYAL WELCOME ONLY THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS AND THE PHARISEES WERE SORRY TO SEE JESUS COME WHAT IS THERE WE CAN DO THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER
1970-28415-0007 WHO IS THIS THEY ASKED OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM ANSWERED WHY THIS IS JESUS THE PROPHET FROM NAZARETH IN GALILEE
1970-28415-0008 THIS WAS HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HIS HOUSE THESE WERE HIS FATHER'S PEOPLE AND HIS PEOPLE THE KING FOR WHOM THE JEWS HAD BEEN WAITING HAD COME AT LAST TO REIGN
1970-28415-0009 THIS TIME HE CARRIED A WHIP IN THE COURT OF THE GENTILES THE MONEY WAS CLINKING AS IT HAD DONE WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY AT TABLES SAT THE MEN WHO GREW RICH BY EXCHANGING THE MONEY OF VISITORS FOR COINS USED IN JERUSALEM
1970-28415-0010 OTHERS WERE SELLING DOVES FOR SACRIFICE THE POOR HAD TO PAY HEAVILY TO WORSHIP GOD IN HIS OWN HOUSE JESUS STRODE DOWN THE ROOM WITH THE WHIP IN HIS HAND AND UPSET THE TABLES WHERE THE MONEY WAS
1970-28415-0011 WHEN THE MEN JUMPED UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS HE DROVE THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE THEN HE DROVE THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE OUT AFTER THE MEN IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURES GOD'S HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER
1970-28415-0012 BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT INTO A DEN OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS HE CRIED THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT MEN WHO RULED JERUSALEM THE NEXT DAY SOME OF THE RULERS CAME TO JESUS AND SAID
1970-28415-0013 WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO DO THESE THINGS WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD ACT LIKE THIS SO FAR JESUS HAD NEVER SAID THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
1970-28415-0014 BUT JESUS WAS TOO QUICK FOR THEM HE SAID I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF YOU ANSWER A QUESTION OF MINE WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST USED TO PREACH TO YOU AND BAPTIZE PEOPLE WHO GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT
1970-28415-0015 THEN THE RULERS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY THEY THOUGHT TO THEMSELVES NOW IF WE SAY THAT JOHN WAS SENT BY GOD TO PREACH HE WILL SAY WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM THEN IF WE SAY THAT JOHN DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO PREACH
1970-28415-0016 NEITHER AM I GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WEEK JESUS CAME AND TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE SEVERAL TIMES HIS ENEMIES TRIED TO TRICK HIM INTO SAYING SOMETHING THAT WOULD TURN THE PEOPLE AGAINST HIM
1970-28415-0017 BUT JESUS ALWAYS HAD AN ANSWER WHICH SILENCED THEM ONCE THEY CAME AND ASKED SHOULD WE PAY TAXES TO THE ROMANS THAT WAS A HARD QUESTION
1970-28415-0018 EVERYBODY WOULD HATE HIM TOO BUT IF HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT PAY THE TAXES WELL THEY COULD COUNT ON THE ROMAN GOVERNOR TO SETTLE WITH JESUS THEN
1970-28415-0019 THERE WAS A MAN'S PICTURE STAMPED ON ONE SIDE OF IT JESUS SAID WHOSE PICTURE IS THAT WHY THEY ANSWERED THAT IS A PICTURE OF CAESAR THE EMPEROR OF ROME ALL RIGHT SAID JESUS
1970-28415-0020 DO WHATEVER YOUR DUTY IS TO CAESAR AND HIS GOVERNMENT YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT FOR YOURSELVES AND ALSO DO YOUR DUTY TO GOD IT WAS SUCH A CLEVER ANSWER THAT NO ONE HAD A WORD TO SAY
1970-28415-0021 WATCH OUT FOR THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES HE TOLD THE PEOPLE AND DON'T BE LIKE THEM THEY LOVE TO WALK AROUND IN THEIR LONG WHITE ROBES AND TO HAVE EVERYBODY BOW TO THEM IN THE STREET AND TO SIT IN THE BEST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND AT DINNERS
1970-28415-0022 WHICH PEOPLE WALK OVER WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IS UNDERNEATH NOBODY KNOWS HOW BAD YOU ARE YOU SNAKES HOW CAN YOU ESCAPE THE PUNISHMENT WHICH GOD IS BRINGING UPON YOU HE LEFT THE PHARISEES AND WENT INTO THE TEMPLE
1970-28415-0023 WHERE PEOPLE WERE MAKING THEIR GIFTS TO GOD
1970-28415-0024 THEN CAME A POOR WIDOW WHO PUT TWO SMALL COINS INTO THE BOX JESUS CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID I TELL YOU THIS POOR WIDOW HAS GIVEN MORE THAN ALL THESE RICH PEOPLE ARE GIVING
1970-28415-0025 AND IT DOESN'T COST THEM ANYTHING TO GIVE WHAT THEY DO BUT THIS POOR WOMAN NEEDS HER MONEY AND SHE HAS GIVEN ALL SHE HAS WITH MANY WORDS AND STORIES HE TAUGHT THE PEOPLE WHO THRONGED AROUND HIM ON THE DAYS OF THAT WEEK
1970-28415-0026 AND THIS WAS THE LAST STORY HE EVER TOLD SOMEDAY I SHALL SIT UPON MY THRONE AND JUDGE ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH TO SOME PEOPLE I WILL SAY COME MY HEAVENLY FATHER LOVES YOU
1970-28415-0027 TAKE THE REWARD HE HAS PLANNED FOR YOU TO HAVE FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR HOMES
1970-28415-0028 I HAD NOTHING TO WEAR AND YOU GAVE ME CLOTHES I WAS SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU CAME TO VISIT ME THEN THESE PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED AND SAY LORD WHEN DID WE EVER DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
1970-28415-0029 THEN I WILL SAY TO OTHERS GO AWAY GOD WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND NAKED AND SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU DID NOTHING AT ALL FOR ME
1970-28415-0030 THESE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE SURPRISED THEY WILL SAY LORD
1970-28415-0031 IF WE HAD SEEN YOU NEEDING ANYTHING WE WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU AND I WILL SAY MANY POOR PEOPLE NEEDED YOUR HELP AND YOU DID NOT HELP THEM WHEN YOU FAILED THEM YOU FAILED ME AND NOW IT IS TOO LATE
1970-28415-0032 IF HE HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE IN JERUSALEM PRETENDING TO BE KING OF THE JEWS THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS WANTED TO KILL JESUS THAT WAS ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE
1970-28415-0033 FOR WHENEVER JESUS CAME TO JERUSALEM GREAT CROWDS GATHERED AROUND HIM NONE OF THE PRIESTS DARED TO LAY A FINGER ON HIM IN THE OPEN THE CROWDS WOULD NEVER LET THEM IT SEEMED TO THE PEOPLE AS IF THE MESSIAH MIGHT HAVE COME AT LAST
1970-28415-0034 BUT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS SAID THE WEEK WAS GOING BY
1970-28415-0035 WE SHALL HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH JESUS QUIETLY SOMEONE SAID YES THE OTHERS AGREED WE CAN'T WAIT TILL THE DAY OF THE PASSOVER IF WE SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO HIM ON THAT DAY THERE WOULD BE A RIOT
1970-28415-0036 THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF JESUS THE CRAFTIEST MEN IN JERUSALEM COULD NOT THINK WHAT TO DO THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR IT WAS ONE OF JESUS TWELVE DISCIPLES
1970-28415-0037 WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME JUDAS SAID IF I TURN JESUS OVER TO YOU THE PRIESTS AND RULERS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THEIR EARS THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER YOU SHALL HAVE THEY CRIED IF YOU GIVE US JESUS
1970-28415-0038 SO FOR THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER JUDAS AGREED TO SHOW THEM WHERE JESUS WAS AT SOME TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND BUT THE TWELVE DISCIPLES SEND SOLDIERS WHEN I TELL YOU JUDAS SAID
1970-28415-0039 THE OTHER DISCIPLES WILL ALL BE THERE AND THE SOLDIERS WON'T KNOW WHICH MAN TO TAKE BUT I WILL GO UP TO JESUS AND KISS HIM THE MAN I KISS WILL BE THE ONE YOU WANT

5192-19397-0013 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS MASTER TO SLIP BACKWARDS UPON THE GRASS A LITTLE BEYOND HIS BODY IN ORDER TO ALLOW IT THE GREATER SWEEP AND BY AN UNFORCED COMPRESSION AT THE SAME TIME OF HIS CAP WITH THE THUMB AND THE TWO FOREFINGERS OF HIS LEFT BY WHICH THE DIAMETER
5192-19397-0014 OF THE CAP BECAME REDUCED SO THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID RATHER TO BE INSENSIBLY SQUEEZ'D THAN PULL'D OFF WITH A FLATUS THE CORPORAL ACQUITTED HIMSELF OF BOTH IN A BETTER MANNER THAN THE POSTURE OF HIS AFFAIRS PROMISED AND HAVING HEMMED TWICE

6415-116629-0038 GERTRUDE MOUNTED WEARILY TO HER ROOM AS IF HER LAST DAY WAS COME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER BED AND WHEN THE MORNING LIGHT FILLED THE ROOM STILL SHE SAT THERE LISTENING IN TREMBLING ANXIETY
6415-116629-0039 AS SHE HAD LISTENED THROUGH ALL THE LONG NIGHT IN VAIN DIETRICH HAD NOT COME HOME IN THE NIGHT
6415-111615-0000 OR ANY PAINFUL JOB SO FULL OF PLEASURES AS THE TASK OF CONDUCTING A NEWSPAPER COLUMN THE
6415-111615-0001 IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE NOBODY NOTICES IT HE SOON OUTGROWS THIS AND IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE NOTICE IT AND HE IMAGINES THAT ALL SEE THE PALTRINESS OF IT AS PLAINLY AS HE DOES
6415-111615-0002 THERE IS NOTHING SO AMAZING TO HIM AS TO FIND THAT ANY ONE REALLY ENJOYS HIS STUFF POOR SOUL HE REMEMBERS HOW HE GROANED OVER IT AT HIS DESK HE REMEMBERS THE HOURS HE SAT WITH LACK LUSTRE EYE AND ADDLED BRAIN
6415-111615-0003 BROODING AT THE SLUTTISH TYPEWRITER HE REMEMBERS THE FLUSH OF SHAME THAT TINGLED HIM AS HE WALKED SADLY HOMEWARD THINKING OF SOME ATROCIOUS INANITY HE HAD SENT UPSTAIRS TO THE COMPOSING ROOM IT IS A JOB THAT ENGENDERS A HEALTHY HUMILITY
6415-111615-0004 I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A TRY AT WRITING A COLUMN HEAVEN HELP ME I THINK I HAD AN IDEA THAT I WAS BORN FOR THE JOB I MAY AS WELL BE CANDID THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT OF INSERTING THE FOLLOWING AD IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0005 I FIND A MEMORANDUM OF IT IN MY SCRAP BOOK HUMORIST YOUNG AND UNTAMED LINEAL DESCENDENT OF EUGENE FIELD FRANK STOCKTON AND FRANCOIS RABELAIS DESIRES TO RUN A COLUMN IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0006 A GUARANTEED CIRCULATION GETTER SAID HUMORIST CAN ALSO SUPPLY EXCELLENT VEINS OF PHILOSOPHY POETRY SATIRE UPLIFT GLAD MATERIAL AND INDISCRIMINATE MUSINGS
6415-111615-0007 REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY NEWSPAPER DESIRING A REALLY UNUSUAL EDITORIAL FEATURE ADDRESS HUMORIST ET CETERA SO BESOTTED WAS I I WOULD HAVE PAID TO HAVE THIS PRINTED IF I HAD NOT BEEN COUNSELLED BY AN OLDER AND WISER HEAD
6415-111615-0008 I INSTANCE THIS TO SHOW THAT THE COLYUMIST IS LIKELY TO BEGIN HIS JOB WITH THE CONCEPTION THAT IT IS TO BE A PERPETUAL UPROAR OF MIRTH AND HIGH SPIRITS THIS LASTS ABOUT A WEEK
6415-111615-0009 HE HAS TO DEAL WITH THE MOST ELUSIVE AND GROTESQUE MATERIAL HE KNOWS HIS OWN MIND AND THE UNHAPPY CREATURE EVERLASTINGLY PROBING HIMSELF IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING WHAT IS SO RARE IN MINDS A THOUGHT IS LIKELY TO END IN A FERMENT OF BITTERNESS
6415-111615-0010 IF YOU HAVE TO BE ENDLESSLY SPECULATING WATCHING AND MAKING MENTAL NOTES YOUR BRAIN GEARS SOON GET A HOT BOX THE ORIGINAL OF ALL PARAGRAPHERS
6415-111615-0011 CAME VERY NEAR ENDING AS A COMPLETE CYNIC THOUGH IN WHAT F P A WOULD CALL HIS LASTLINE HE MANAGED TO WRIGGLE INTO A MORE HOPEFUL MOOD THE FIRST VALUABLE DISCOVERY THAT THE COLYUMIST IS LIKELY TO MAKE IS THAT ALL MINDS ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME
6415-111615-0012 THE DOCTORS TELL US THAT ALL PATENT MEDICINES ARE BUILT ON A STOCK FORMULA A SEDATIVE A PURGE AND A BITTER IF YOU ARE TO MAKE STEADY COLUMN TOPERS OUT OF YOUR READERS YOUR DAILY DOSE MUST
6415-111615-0013 AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AVERAGE UP TO THAT SAME PRESCRIPTION IF YOU EMPLOY THE PURGE ALL THE TIME OR THE SEDATIVE OR THE ACID YOUR CLIENTS WILL SOON ASK FOR SOMETHING WITH ANOTHER LABEL
6415-111615-0014 IT IS HARD TO GET THE COLYUMIST TO ADMIT THIS FOR HE FEARS SPOOFING WORSE THAN THE DEVIL BUT IT IS EMINENTLY TRUE IF I WERE THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0015 THE FOLLOWING WORDS FROM ISAIAH THE BEST OF ALL WATCHWORDS FOR ALL WHO WRITE WOE UNTO THEM THAT CALL EVIL GOOD AND GOOD EVIL THAT PUT DARKNESS FOR LIGHT AND LIGHT FOR DARKNESS THAT PUT BITTER FOR SWEET AND SWEET FOR BITTER
6415-111615-0016 THE MOST PAINFUL PRIVILEGE OF THE COLYUMIST'S JOB IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DROP IN TO SEE HIM USUALLY WHEN HE IS IMPRECATING HIS WAY TOWARD THE HOUR OF GOING TO PRESS THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE GREAT AND SALUTARY HUMAN INSTINCT AGAINST WORK
6415-111615-0017 YET NOW AND THEN HE GETS A GLIMPSE INTO A HUMAN VEXATION SO SINCERE SO HONEST AND SO MOVING THAT HE TURNS AWAY FROM THE TYPEWRITER WITH A SIGH HE WONDERS HOW ONE DARE APPROACH THE CHRONICLING OF THIS MUDDLED PANORAMA
6415-111615-0018 WITH ANYTHING BUT HUMILITY AND DESPAIR FRANK HARRIS ONCE SAID OF OSCAR WILDE IF ENGLAND INSISTS ON TREATING HER CRIMINALS LIKE THIS SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY SIMILARLY
6415-111615-0019 IF THE PUBLIC INSISTS ON BRINGING ITS WOES TO ITS COLYUMISTS IT DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY COLYUMISTS THEN THE BATTERED JESTER TURNS AGAIN TO HIS MACHINE AND TICKS OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS
6415-111615-0020 A PESSIMIST HE SAYS IS A MAN WHO WEARS BOTH BELT AND SUSPENDERS WHEN A BIG JEWELLERY FIRM IN THE CITY PUTS OUT A LARGE AD BAILEY BANKS AND BIDDLE COMPANY WATCHES FOR WOMEN OF SUPERIOR DESIGN AND PERFECTION OF MOVEMENT
6415-111615-0021 ALL THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO THAT IS TO WRITE OVER IT THE CAPTION SO DO WE ALL AND PASS ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THE MORE A COLYUMIST IS OUT
6415-111615-0022 ON THE STREETS MAKING HIMSELF THE REPORTER OF THE MOODS AND ODDITIES OF MEN THE BETTER HIS STUFF WILL BE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HIS JOB OUGHT TO BE GOOD TRAINING FOR A NOVELIST AS IT TEACHES HIM A HABIT OF HUMAN SENSITIVENESS
6415-111615-0023 HE BECOMES FILLED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CURIOSITY ABOUT THE MOTIVES AND PURPOSES OF THE PEOPLE HE SEES
6415-111615-0024 WHO WAS STANDING ON CHESTNUT STREET STUDYING A POCKET NOTEBOOK HIS UMBRELLA LEANED AGAINST A SHOP WINDOW ON THE SILL OF WHICH HE HAD LAID A CAREFULLY ROLLED UP NEWSPAPER BY HIS FEET WAS A NEAT LEATHER BRIEF CASE PLUMPLY FILLED WITH CONTENTS NOT DISCERNIBLE
6415-111615-0025 THERE HE STOOD A SORT OF UNSUCCESSFUL CYRUS CURTIS VERY DIMINUTIVE HIS GRAY HAIR RATHER LONG ABAFT HIS NECK HIS YELLOWISH STRAW HAT WITH CURLY BRIM TILTED BACKWARD AS THOUGH IN PERPLEXITY
6415-111615-0026 HIS TIMID AND ABSORBED BLUE EYES PORING OVER HIS MEMORANDUM BOOK WHICH WAS FULL OF PENCILLED NOTES HE HAD A SLIGHTLY UNKEMPT BRIEF BEARD AND WHISKERS HIS CHEEK BONES PINKISH HIS LINEN A LITTLE FRAYED THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY PATHETIC ABOUT HIM
6415-111615-0027 AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM I HALTED AT A WINDOW FARTHER DOWN THE STREET AND STUDIED HIM THEN RETURNED TO PASS HIM AGAIN AND WATCHED HIM PATIENTLY HE STOOD QUITE ABSORBED AND WAS STILL THERE WHEN I WENT ON
6415-111615-0028 THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VIVID LITTLE PICTURES ONE SEES ON THE CITY STREETS DAY BY DAY TO CATCH SOME HINT OF THE MEANING OF ALL THIS TO PRESENT A FEW SCRAWLED NOTES OF THE AMAZING INTEREST AND COLOUR OF THE CITY'S LIFE
6415-111615-0029 THIS IS THE COLYUMIST'S TASK AS I SEE IT IT IS A TASK NOT A WHIT LESS WORTHY LESS PAINFUL OR LESS BAFFLING THAN THAT OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS NOVELIST
6415-111615-0030 AND IT IS CARRIED ON IN SURROUNDINGS OF EXTRAORDINARY STIMULATION AND DIFFICULTY IT IS HEART RACKING TO STRUGGLE DAY BY DAY AMID INCESSANT INTERRUPTION AND MELEE TO SNATCH OUT OF THE HURLY BURLY SOME SHREDS OF HUMOUR OR PATHOS OR
6415-111615-0031 DARE ONE SAY BEAUTY AND PHRASE THEM INTELLIGIBLY BUT IT IS FUN ONE NEVER BUYS A PACKAGE OF TOBACCO CROSSES A CITY SQUARE ENTERS A TROLLEY CAR OR STUDIES A SHOP WINDOW WITHOUT TRYING IN A BAFFLED HOPELESS WAY
6415-111615-0032 TO PEER THROUGH THE FRONTAGE OF THE EXPERIENCE TO FIND SOME GLIMMER OF THE THOUGHTS EMOTIONS AND MEANINGS BEHIND AND IN THE LONG RUN SUCH A HABIT OF INQUIRY MUST BEAR FRUIT IN UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY JOSEPH CONRAD
6415-111615-0033 WHO SEEMS BY THE WAY TO BE MORE READ BY NEWSPAPER MEN THAN ANY OTHER WRITER PUT VERY NOBLY THE PINNACLE OF ALL SCRIBBLERS DREAMS WHEN HE SAID THAT HUMAN AFFAIRS DESERVE THE TRIBUTE OF A SIGH WHICH IS NOT A SOB A SMILE
6415-111615-0034 WHICH IS NOT A GRIN SO MUCH WITH APOLOGY FOR THE IDEALS OF THE COLYUMIST IF HE BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK TRUTH WITHOUT FEAR OF MOCKERY OF COURSE IN THE ACTUAL PROCESS AND TRAVAIL OF HIS JOB YOU WILL FIND HIM FAR DIFFERENT
6415-111615-0035 YOU MAY KNOW HIM BY A SUNKEN BROODING EYE CLOTHING MARRED BY MUCH TOBACCO AND A CHAFED AND TETCHY HUMOUR TOWARD THE HOUR OF FIVE P M HAVING BITTERLY SCHOOLED HIMSELF TO SEE MEN AS PARAGRAPHS WALKING
6415-111615-0036 HE FINDS THAT HIS MOST AUGUST MUSINGS HAVE A HABIT OF STEWING THEMSELVES DOWN TO SOME FEROCIOUS OR JOCULAR THREE LINE COMMENT
6415-111615-0037 TO CHURN UP FROM THE TYPEWRITER SOME LYRIC THAT WILL ROCK WITH BLUE SEAS AND FRANTIC HEARTS
6415-111615-0038 POOR SOUL HE IS LIKE ONE CONDEMNED TO HARANGUE THE VAST IDIOTIC WORLD THROUGH A KEYHOLE WHENCE HIS ANGUISH ISSUES THIN AND FAINT YET WHO WILL SAY THAT ALL HIS LABOUR IS WHOLLY VAIN
6415-111615-0039 PERHAPS SOME DAY THE GOVERNMENT WILL CROWN A COLYUMIST LAUREATE SOME MAJESTIC SAGE WITH ANCIENT PATIENT BLUE EYES AND A SNOWY BEARD NOBLY STAINED WITH NICOTINE WHOSE UTTERANCES WILL BE HEEDED WITH SHUDDERING RESPECT
6081-41998-0000 WHEN A MYSTERIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN PERPETRATED OR A GREAT CATASTROPHE HAS HAPPENED AND THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIMS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED A GREAT DAY INVARIABLY FOLLOWS AT THE MORGUE
6081-41998-0001 THE ATTENDANTS ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE HORRORS OF THE PLACE THAT THE MOST SICKLY SIGHT FAILS TO IMPRESS THEM AND EVEN UNDER THE MOST DISTRESSING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HASTEN GAILY TO AND FRO
6081-41998-0002 EXCHANGING JESTS WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL'S FLESH CREEP AS A RULE THEY ARE FAR LESS INTERESTED IN THE CORPSES LAID OUT FOR PUBLIC VIEW ON THE MARBLE SLABS IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL
6081-41998-0003 AS THE VEHICLE CONVEYING LECOQ REACHED THE QUAY
6081-41998-0004 THE NEWSPAPERS HAD REPORTED THE TRAGEDY AT THE WIDOW CHUPIN'S DRINKING DEN OF COURSE MORE OR LESS CORRECTLY AND EVERYBODY WISHED TO SEE THE VICTIMS
6081-41998-0005 I PREFER TO ALIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IN FRONT OF THE MORGUE HE SAID SPRINGING TO THE GROUND THEN PRODUCING FIRST HIS WATCH AND NEXT HIS PURSE HE ADDED
6081-41998-0006 WE HAVE BEEN AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES MY GOOD FELLOW CONSEQUENTLY I OWE YOU NOTHING AT ALL REPLIED THE DRIVER DECIDEDLY BUT NO NOT A SOU
6081-41998-0007 I AM TOO WORRIED ALREADY TO THINK THAT I TOOK THE MONEY THESE HUSSIES OFFERED ME IT WOULD ONLY HAVE SERVED ME RIGHT IF THE LIQUOR I BOUGHT WITH IT HAD GIVEN ME THE GRIPES DON'T BE UNEASY ABOUT THE SCORE AND IF YOU NEED A TRAP USE MINE FOR NOTHING
6081-41998-0008 TILL YOU HAVE CAUGHT THE JADES AS LECOQ'S PURSE WAS LOW HE DID NOT INSIST YOU WILL AT LEAST TAKE MY NAME AND ADDRESS CONTINUED THE DRIVER CERTAINLY
6081-41998-0009 THE MAGISTRATE WILL WANT YOUR EVIDENCE AND A SUMMONS WILL BE SENT YOU ALL RIGHT THEN ADDRESS IT TO PAPILLON EUGENE DRIVER
6081-41998-0010 I LODGE AT HIS PLACE BECAUSE I HAVE SOME SMALL INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS YOU SEE THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN PAPILLON CALLED HIM BACK WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MORGUE YOU WILL WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE HE SAID
6081-41998-0011 YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND THAT YOU WERE ALREADY LATE YES I OUGHT TO BE AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE BUT IT IS ONLY A FEW STEPS FROM HERE NO MATTER
6081-41998-0012 I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE IT'S USELESS TO SAY NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AND I'M A BRETON YOU KNOW
6081-41998-0013 ACCORDINGLY LECOQ MADE A GESTURE OF ASSENT AND THEN HURRIED TOWARD THE MORGUE IF THERE WAS A CROWD ON THE ROADWAY OUTSIDE IT WAS BECAUSE THE GLOOMY BUILDING ITSELF WAS CRAMMED FULL OF PEOPLE INDEED THE SIGHTSEERS
6081-41998-0014 MOST OF WHOM COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL WERE PACKED AS CLOSELY AS SARDINES
6081-41998-0015 THAT LECOQ MANAGED TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AS USUAL HE FOUND AMONG THE MOB A LARGE NUMBER OF GIRLS AND WOMEN FOR STRANGE TO SAY
6081-41998-0016 TO THE DISGUSTING SIGHTS AND HORRIBLE EMOTIONS THAT REPAY A VISIT TO THE MORGUE THE SHOP AND WORK GIRLS WHO RESIDE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD READILY GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE CORPSES
6081-41998-0017 WHICH CRIME ACCIDENT AND SUICIDE BRING TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE A FEW
6081-41998-0018 MAY COME NO FURTHER THAN THE DOOR BUT THE OTHERS ENTER AND AFTER A LONG STARE RETURN AND RECOUNT THEIR IMPRESSIONS TO THEIR LESS COURAGEOUS COMPANIONS IF THERE SHOULD BE NO CORPSE EXHIBITED
6081-41998-0019 IF ALL THE MARBLE SLABS ARE UNOCCUPIED STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THE VISITORS TURN HASTILY AWAY WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DISAPPOINTMENT OR DISCONTENT THERE WAS NO FEAR OF THEIR DOING SO HOWEVER
6081-41998-0020 FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MURDERER WHOSE IDENTITY LECOQ WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH HAD FURNISHED THREE VICTIMS FOR THEIR DELECTATION
6081-41998-0021 AND YET A DAMP CHILL CAME FROM BEYOND THE IRON RAILINGS WHILE FROM THE CROWD ITSELF ROSE AN INFECTIOUS VAPOR IMPREGNATED WITH THE STENCH OF THE CHLORIDE OF LIME USED AS A DISINFECTANT
6081-41998-0022 AS A CONTINUOUS ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE EXCLAMATIONS SIGHS AND WHISPERED COMMENTS OF THE BYSTANDERS CAME THE MURMUR OF THE WATER TRICKLING FROM A SPIGOT AT THE HEAD OF EACH SLAB A TINY STREAM THAT FLOWED FORTH
6081-41998-0023 ONLY TO FALL IN FINE SPRAY UPON THE MARBLE THROUGH THE SMALL ARCHED WINDOWS A GRAY LIGHT STOLE IN ON THE EXPOSED BODIES BRINGING EACH MUSCLE INTO BOLD RELIEF
6081-41998-0024 REVEALING THE GHASTLY TINTS OF THE LIFELESS FLESH AND IMPARTING A SINISTER ASPECT TO THE TATTERED CLOTHING HUNG AROUND THE ROOM TO AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORPSES THIS CLOTHING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IS SOLD
6081-41998-0025 FOR NOTHING IS WASTED AT THE MORGUE HOWEVER LECOQ WAS TOO OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO REMARK THE HORRORS OF THE SCENE HE SCARCELY BESTOWED A GLANCE ON THE THREE VICTIMS
6081-41998-0026 WHOM HE COULD NOT PERCEIVE HAD GEVROL INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY FAILED TO FULFIL HIS PROMISE
6081-41998-0027 UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF HIS COMRADE'S ABSENCE LECOQ ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEAD KEEPER IT WOULD SEEM THAT NO ONE HAS RECOGNIZED THE VICTIMS HE REMARKED NO ONE AND YET
6081-41998-0028 EVER SINCE OPENING WE HAVE HAD AN IMMENSE CROWD IF I WERE MASTER HERE ON DAYS LIKE THIS I WOULD CHARGE AN ADMISSION FEE OF TWO SOUS A HEAD
6081-41998-0029 IT WOULD BRING IN A ROUND SUM MORE THAN ENOUGH TO COVER THE EXPENSES THE KEEPER'S REPLY SEEMED TO OFFER AN INDUCEMENT TO CONVERSATION BUT LECOQ DID NOT SEIZE IT
6081-41998-0030 BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION HE VENTURED TO INQUIRE ARE YOU ONE OF THEM YES I AM REPLIED LECOQ EXHIBITING HIS CARD IN SUPPORT OF HIS ASSERTION AND YOUR NAME
6081-41998-0031 THE KEEPER'S FACE BRIGHTENED UP IN THAT CASE SAID HE I HAVE A LETTER FOR YOU WRITTEN BY YOUR COMRADE WHO WAS OBLIGED TO GO AWAY HERE IT IS THE YOUNG DETECTIVE AT ONCE TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE AND READ
6081-41998-0032 MONSIEUR LECOQ MONSIEUR THIS SIMPLE FORMULA OF POLITENESS BROUGHT A FAINT SMILE TO HIS LIPS
6081-41998-0033 WHEN AT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THREE YOUNG MEN ENTERED ARM IN ARM FROM THEIR MANNER AND APPEARANCE I JUDGED THEM TO BE CLERKS IN SOME STORE OR WAREHOUSE
6081-41998-0034 SUDDENLY I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THEM TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS SHIRT AND CALLING THE ATTENTION OF HIS COMPANIONS TO ONE OF THE UNKNOWN VICTIMS HE WHISPERED GUSTAVE
6081-41998-0035 HIS COMRADES PUT THEIR HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT YOU FOOL TO MIX YOURSELF UP WITH THIS AFFAIR DO YOU WANT TO GET US INTO TROUBLE THEREUPON THEY WENT OUT AND I FOLLOWED THEM
6081-41998-0036 BUT THE PERSON WHO HAD FIRST SPOKEN WAS SO OVERCOME THAT HE COULD SCARCELY DRAG HIMSELF ALONG AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE OBLIGED TO TAKE HIM TO A LITTLE RESTAURANT CLOSE BY I ENTERED IT MYSELF AND IT IS THERE I WRITE THIS LETTER
6081-41998-0037 IN THE MEAN TIME WATCHING THEM OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SEND THIS NOTE EXPLAINING MY ABSENCE TO THE HEAD KEEPER WHO WILL GIVE IT YOU YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GOING TO FOLLOW THESE MEN A B
6081-41998-0038 S THE HANDWRITING OF THIS LETTER WAS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE AND THERE WERE MISTAKES IN SPELLING IN WELL NIGH EVERY LINE STILL ITS MEANING WAS CLEAR AND EXACT AND COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE THE MOST FLATTERING HOPES
6081-41998-0039 AS THE OLD COACHMAN URGED ON HIS HORSE HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING THINGS ARE GOING ON TO SUIT YOU A FRIENDLY HUSH WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE
6081-41998-0040 WHO INSISTED UPON REMAINING AT HIS ORDERS HE SUCCEEDED AT LAST HOWEVER BUT EVEN WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE PORTICO ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
6081-41998-0041 LECOQ HAD ENTERED THE LEFT WING OF THE PALAIS HE CLIMBED THE STAIRS TILL HE HAD REACHED THE THIRD FLOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE LONG NARROW BADLY LIGHTED CORRIDOR
6081-41998-0042 WHEN FINDING A DOORKEEPER INSTALLED BEHIND A HEAVY OAKEN DESK HE REMARKED
6081-41998-0043 THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD NO SAID HE
6081-42010-0000 HE FIRST OF ALL PROCEEDED TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE GOING THE LONGEST WAY ROUND AS A MATTER OF COURSE BUT ON REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO HAD SEEN THE YOUNG DETECTIVE ACCORDINGLY
6081-42010-0001 AND DEPENDENT ON THE CUSTOMERS IT BROUGHT THEM BEING OF A CONSCIENTIOUS TURN OF MIND HE ENTERED EACH ESTABLISHMENT IN SUCCESSION AND MEETING NOW AND AGAIN VARIOUS ACQUAINTANCES HE FELT COMPELLED TO PROFFER AND ACCEPT
6081-42010-0002 NUMEROUS GLASSES OF THE FAVORITE MORNING BEVERAGE WHITE WINE TURN WHICH WAY HE WOULD HOWEVER LOITER AS LONG AS HE MIGHT
6081-42010-0003 HE WAS RETURNING IN HASTE A TRIFLE UNEASY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LENGTH OF HIS ABSENCE WHEN HE PERCEIVED A CAB PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE PALAIS GATEWAY A SECOND GLANCE AND OH GREAT GOOD FORTUNE HE SAW LECOQ
6081-42010-0004 FATHER ABSINTHE AND THE VIRTUOUS TOINON ALIGHT FROM THIS VERY VEHICLE HIS PEACE OF MIND AT ONCE RETURNED AND IT WAS IN A VERY IMPORTANT AND SOMEWHAT HUSKY TONE
6081-42010-0005 THAT HE DELIVERED THE ORDER FOR LECOQ TO FOLLOW HIM WITHOUT A MINUTE'S DELAY
6081-42010-0006 HAS ASKED FOR YOU A NUMBER OF TIMES SAID HE HE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPATIENT AND HE IS IN A VERY BAD HUMOR SO YOU MAY EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD SNAPPED OFF IN THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MANNER LECOQ SMILED AS HE WENT UP THE STAIRS
6081-42010-0007 WAS HE NOT BRINGING WITH HIM THE MOST POTENT OF JUSTIFICATIONS HE THOUGHT OF THE AGREEABLE SURPRISE HE HAD IN STORE FOR THE MAGISTRATE AND FANCIED HE COULD PICTURE THE SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THAT FUNCTIONARY'S GLOOMY FACE
6081-42010-0008 AND YET FATE SO WILLED IT THAT THE DOORKEEPER'S MESSAGE AND HIS URGENT APPEAL THAT LECOQ SHOULD NOT LOITER ON THE WAY PRODUCED THE MOST UNFORTUNATE RESULTS
6081-42010-0009 WHEN HE SAW HOWEVER THAT THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT ALONE AND WHEN HE RECOGNIZED POLYTE CHUPIN THE ORIGINAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
6081-42010-0010 HE INSTANTLY PERCEIVED HIS MISTAKE AND UNDERSTOOD ITS CONSEQUENCES THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE HE MUST PREVENT ANY EXCHANGE OF WORDS BETWEEN THE TWO
6081-42010-0011 HE ORDERED HER TO LEAVE THE ROOM AT ONCE BUT THE POOR CREATURE WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND TREMBLED LIKE A LEAF HER EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER UNWORTHY HUSBAND AND THE HAPPINESS SHE FELT AT SEEING HIM AGAIN SHONE PLAINLY IN HER ANXIOUS GAZE
6081-42010-0012 JUST FOR ONE SECOND AND THEN SHE CAUGHT HIS WITHERING GLANCE AND HEARD HIS WORDS OF MENACE TERROR STRICKEN SHE STAGGERED BACK AND THEN LECOQ SEIZED HER AROUND THE WAIST
6081-42010-0013 AND LIFTING HER WITH HIS STRONG ARMS CARRIED HER OUT INTO THE PASSAGE THE WHOLE SCENE HAD BEEN SO BRIEF
6081-42010-0014 WAS STILL FORMING THE ORDER FOR TOINON TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ROOM WHEN HE FOUND THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN
6081-42010-0015 AH AH THOUGHT THE SMILING CLERK IN A FLUTTER OF DELIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW BUT AS THESE LITTLE DIVERSIONS NEVER MADE HIM FORGET HIS DUTIES HE LEANED TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE AND ASKED
6081-42010-0016 AND WORD FOR WORD IF YOU PLEASE HE PAUSED THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN THIS TIME TO ADMIT THE MAGISTRATE'S MESSENGER WHO TIMIDLY AND WITH A RATHER GUILTY AIR
6081-42010-0017 AT THE SAME TIME CASTING THE BLAME ON HIS OWN IMPATIENCE AND LACK OF CAUTION
6081-42010-0018 YET OBTAINING THE INFORMATION HE DESIRED LET US PROCEED HE SAID TO POLYTE WHO HAD NOT MOVED SINCE HIS WIFE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE ROOM
6081-42010-0019 BEING TO ALL APPEARANCES SUBLIMELY INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING PASSING AROUND HIM TO THE MAGISTRATE'S PROPOSAL HE CARELESSLY NODDED ASSENT WAS THAT YOUR WIFE WHO CAME IN JUST NOW
6081-42010-0020 WHY DID YOU BEHAVE IN THAT MANNER IT WASN'T THE TIME FOR SENTIMENT YOU ARE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH YOU SIMPLY DESIRED TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION TO INFLUENCE HER EVIDENCE I
6081-42010-0021 I INFLUENCE HER EVIDENCE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU BUT FOR THAT SUPPOSITION YOUR WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN MEANINGLESS WHAT WORDS THE MAGISTRATE TURNED TO HIS CLERK
6081-42010-0022 READ THE LAST REMARK YOU TOOK DOWN IN A MONOTONOUS VOICE THE SMILING CLERK REPEATED I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL THE PERSON WHO DARED TO SAY THAT I KNEW LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0023 WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND SIR
6081-42010-0024 DON'T PREVARICATE ANY LONGER HE SAID YOU CERTAINLY ORDERED YOUR WIFE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LACHENEUR THAT'S EVIDENT WHY DID YOU DO SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER TELLING US
6081-42010-0025 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE POLICE ARE IGNORANT OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH LACHENEUR OF YOUR CONVERSATION WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME IN A CAB TO THE CORNER OF THE WASTE GROUND NEAR YOUR MOTHER'S WINE SHOP AND OF THE HOPES OF FORTUNE YOU BASED UPON HIS PROMISES
6081-42010-0026 BE GUIDED BY ME CONFESS EVERYTHING WHILE THERE IS YET TIME AND ABANDON THE PRESENT COURSE WHICH MAY LEAD YOU INTO SERIOUS DANGER ONE MAY BE AN ACCOMPLICE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
6081-42010-0027 AS THESE WORDS FELL ON POLYTE'S EARS IT WAS EVIDENT HIS IMPUDENCE AND INDIFFERENCE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AND HUNG HIS HEAD AS IF THOROUGHLY ABASHED STILL HE PRESERVED AN OBSTINATE SILENCE
6081-42010-0028 AND THE MAGISTRATE FINDING THAT THIS LAST THRUST HAD FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY EFFECT GAVE UP THE FIGHT IN DESPAIR HE RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED THE GUARD TO CONDUCT THE WITNESS BACK TO PRISON
6081-42010-0029 AND TO TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION TO PREVENT HIM SEEING HIS WIFE AGAIN WHEN POLYTE HAD DEPARTED LECOQ REENTERED THE ROOM
6081-42010-0030 BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE WAITING FOR ME AND MADE HASTE TO BRING HER HERE I THOUGHT I WAS ACTING FOR THE BEST NEVER MIND THE MISFORTUNE CAN BE REPAIRED NO SIR NO SINCE SHE HAS SEEN HER HUSBAND
6081-42010-0031 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0032 AND SHE IS SO TERRIFIED THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF MAKING HER SPEAK
6081-42010-0033 AGAIN SET FOOT IN HIS OFFICE THE POOR CREATURE SEEMED NEARLY HEARTBROKEN
6081-42010-0034 POLYTE'S THREAT HAD AROUSED THE MOST SINISTER APPREHENSIONS IN HER MIND NOT UNDERSTANDING HIS CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIR SHE ASKED HERSELF IF HER TESTIMONY MIGHT NOT PROVE HIS DEATH WARRANT
6081-42010-0035 NO OR I DON'T KNOW AND RETRACTED EVERYTHING SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY STATED TO LECOQ SHE SWORE THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD THAT HER WORDS HAD BEEN MISCONSTRUED
6081-42010-0036 AT LAST SHE BURST INTO WILD DESPAIRING SOBS AND PRESSED HER FRIGHTENED CHILD AGAINST HER BREAST WHAT COULD BE DONE TO OVERCOME THIS FOOLISH OBSTINACY AS BLIND AND UNREASONING AS A BRUTE'S
6081-42010-0037 BUT REMEMBER THAT YOUR STRANGE SILENCE INJURES YOUR HUSBAND FAR MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD SAY SHE LEFT THE ROOM OR RATHER SHE RUSHED WILDLY FROM IT AS THOUGH ONLY TOO EAGER TO ESCAPE
839-130898-0000 IN LATITUDE FORTY SEVEN DEGREES
839-130898-0001 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0002 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS STORM WE WERE THROWN BACK TO THE EAST AWAY WENT ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING TO THE LANDING PLACES OF NEW YORK OR THE SAINT LAWRENCE IN DESPAIR
839-130898-0003 POOR NED WENT INTO SECLUSION LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL AND I NO LONGER LEFT EACH OTHER AS I SAID THE NAUTILUS VEERED TO THE EAST TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THE NORTHEAST
839-130898-0004 SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
839-130898-0005 HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS
839-130898-0006 WHERE THE BREAKING SURF IS COVERED BY THE NOISE OF THE WIND HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE RAMMED EACH OTHER
839-130898-0007 SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED
839-130898-0008 OTHERS NEWER AND REFLECTING OUR BEACON LIGHT ON THEIR IRONWORK AND COPPER UNDERSIDES AMONG THESE VESSELS HOW MANY WENT DOWN WITH ALL HANDS WITH THEIR CREWS AND HOSTS OF IMMIGRANTS
839-130898-0009 AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS CAPE RACE SAINT PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE SAINT LAWRENCE ESTUARY
839-130898-0010 AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
839-130898-0011 THE HUNGARIAN THE CANADIAN THE ANGLO SAXON THE HUMBOLDT
839-130898-0012 ALL RUN AGROUND BY THE ARCTIC AND THE LYONNAIS SUNK IN COLLISIONS BY THE PRESIDENT THE PACIFIC AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW
839-130898-0013 OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED
839-130898-0014 BY MAY FIFTEENTH WE WERE OFF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE GRAND BANKS OF NEWFOUNDLAND THESE BANKS ARE THE RESULT OF MARINE SEDIMENTATION AN EXTENSIVE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC WASTE
839-130898-0015 BROUGHT EITHER FROM THE EQUATOR BY THE GULF STREAM'S CURRENT OR FROM THE NORTH POLE BY THE COUNTERCURRENT OF COLD WATER THAT SKIRTS THE AMERICAN COAST HERE TOO ERRATICALLY DRIFTING CHUNKS COLLECT FROM THE ICE BREAKUP
839-130898-0016 HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS
839-130898-0017 DYING OVER IT BY THE BILLIONS THE SEA IS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AT THE GRAND BANKS A FEW HUNDRED FATHOMS AT BEST BUT TO THE SOUTH THERE IS A DEEP
839-130898-0018 SUDDENLY OCCURRING DEPRESSION A THREE THOUSAND METER PIT HERE THE GULF STREAM WIDENS
839-130898-0019 A ONE METER LUMPFISH BLACKISH ON TOP
839-130898-0020 AND RARE AMONG ITS BRETHREN IN THAT IT PRACTICES MONOGAMY A GOOD SIZED EELPOUT A TYPE OF EMERALD MORAY WHOSE FLAVOR IS EXCELLENT WOLFFISH WITH BIG EYES
839-130898-0021 VIVIPAROUS BLENNIES WHOSE EGGS HATCH INSIDE THEIR BODIES LIKE THOSE OF SNAKES BLOATED GOBIO
839-130898-0022 MEASURING TWO DECIMETERS GRENADIERS WITH LONG TAILS AND GLEAMING WITH A SILVERY GLOW SPEEDY FISH VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR HIGH ARCTIC SEAS OUR NETS ALSO HAULED IN A BOLD
839-130898-0023 DARING VIGOROUS AND MUSCULAR FISH ARMED WITH PRICKLES ON ITS HEAD AND STINGS ON ITS FINS A REAL SCORPION MEASURING TWO TO THREE METERS THE RUTHLESS ENEMY
839-130898-0024 BLENNIES AND SALMON IT WAS THE BULLHEAD OF THE NORTHERLY SEAS A FISH WITH RED FINS AND A BROWN BODY COVERED WITH NODULES
839-130898-0025 THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS
839-130898-0026 CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE AND I'LL MENTION FOR THE RECORD SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES
839-130898-0027 THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
839-130898-0028 CHIEFLY THE COD SPECIES WHICH I DETECTED IN THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE OVER THESE INEXHAUSTIBLE GRAND BANKS BECAUSE NEWFOUNDLAND IS SIMPLY AN UNDERWATER PEAK
839-130898-0029 YOU COULD CALL THESE COD MOUNTAIN FISH WHILE THE NAUTILUS WAS CLEARING A PATH THROUGH THEIR TIGHT RANKS
839-130898-0030 MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE
839-130898-0031 AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM WHAT SWARMS
839-130898-0032 BAH MY FRIEND THERE'D BE MANY MORE WITHOUT THEIR ENEMIES SCORPIONFISH AND HUMAN BEINGS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE FEMALE I'LL GO ALL OUT CONSEIL REPLIED
839-130898-0033 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN MILLION MY FRIEND ELEVEN MILLION I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
839-130898-0034 BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WORK TO BELIEVE ME BESIDES FRENCHMEN ENGLISHMEN AMERICANS DANES AND NORWEGIANS CATCH THESE COD BY THE THOUSANDS THEY'RE EATEN IN PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES AND WITHOUT
839-130898-0035 THE SEAS WOULD SOON BE DEPOPULATED OF THEM ACCORDINGLY IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA ALONE FIVE THOUSAND SHIPS MANNED BY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEAMEN GO AFTER COD EACH SHIP BRINGS BACK AN AVERAGE CATCH
839-130898-0036 OF FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FISH MAKING TWENTY TWO MILLION OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY
839-130898-0037 THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
839-130898-0038 WHAT'S THAT IF ALL THEIR EGGS HATCHED JUST FOUR CODFISH COULD FEED ENGLAND AMERICA AND NORWAY AS WE SKIMMED THE DEPTHS OF THE GRAND BANKS
839-130898-0039 I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH TWO HUNDRED HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON
839-130898-0040 OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
839-130898-0041 THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
839-130898-0042 AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY IT WAS ON MAY SEVENTEENTH
839-130898-0043 ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0044 THAT I SPOTTED THIS CABLE LYING ON THE SEAFLOOR CONSEIL WHOM I HADN'T ALERTED MISTOOK IT AT FIRST FOR A GIGANTIC SEA SNAKE AND WAS GEARING UP TO CLASSIFY IT IN HIS BEST MANNER
839-130898-0045 THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT
839-130898-0046 AFTER TRANSMITTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TELEGRAMS IT WENT DEAD IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ENGINEERS BUILT A NEW CABLE THAT MEASURED
839-130898-0047 FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRIC TONS AND WAS SHIPPED ABOARD THE GREAT EASTERN THIS ATTEMPT ALSO FAILED NOW THEN
839-130898-0048 ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH WHILE SUBMERGED TO A DEPTH OF THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX METERS THE NAUTILUS LAY IN PRECISELY THE LOCALITY WHERE THIS SECOND CABLE SUFFERED THE RUPTURE THAT RUINED THE UNDERTAKING
839-130898-0049 THE ELECTRICIANS ON BOARD DECIDED TO CUT THE CABLE BEFORE FISHING IT UP AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THEY HAD RETRIEVED THE DAMAGED PART THEY REPAIRED THE JOINT AND ITS SPLICE
839-130898-0050 THEN THE CABLE WAS RESUBMERGED BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT SNAPPED AGAIN AND COULDN'T BE RECOVERED FROM THE OCEAN DEPTHS
839-130898-0051 WHO HAD RISKED HIS WHOLE FORTUNE TO PROMOTE THIS UNDERTAKING CALLED FOR A NEW BOND ISSUE IT SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY
839-130898-0052 WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
839-130898-0053 YET THERE WAS ONE HITCH AS THEY GRADUALLY UNROLLED THIS THIRD CABLE THE ELECTRICIANS OBSERVED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE HAD RECENTLY DRIVEN NAILS INTO IT TRYING TO DAMAGE ITS CORE
839-130898-0054 CAPTAIN ANDERSON HIS OFFICERS AND THE ENGINEERS PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER THEN POSTED A WARNING
839-130898-0055 WITHOUT A TRIAL AFTER THAT THESE VILLAINOUS ATTEMPTS WERE NOT REPEATED BY JULY TWENTY THIRD THE GREAT EASTERN WAS LYING NO FARTHER THAN EIGHT HUNDRED KILOMETERS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND
839-130898-0056 WHEN IT RECEIVED TELEGRAPHED NEWS FROM IRELAND
839-130898-0057 SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0058 HAD ENDED HAPPILY AND IN ITS FIRST DISPATCH YOUNG AMERICA ADDRESSED OLD EUROPE WITH THESE WISE WORDS SO RARELY UNDERSTOOD GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL
839-130898-0059 I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS ELECTRIC CABLE IN MINT CONDITION AS IT LOOKED ON LEAVING ITS PLACE OF MANUFACTURE THE LONG SNAKE WAS COVERED WITH SEASHELL RUBBLE AND BRISTLING WITH
839-130898-0060 A CRUST OF CAKED GRAVEL PROTECTED IT FROM ANY MOLLUSKS THAT MIGHT BORE INTO IT IT RESTED SERENELY SHELTERED FROM THE SEA'S MOTIONS UNDER A PRESSURE FAVORABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION
839-130898-0061 THAT GOES FROM AMERICA TO EUROPE
839-130898-0062 THIS CABLE WILL NO DOUBT LAST INDEFINITELY BECAUSE AS OBSERVERS NOTE
839-130898-0063 BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0064 TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE METERS DOWN
839-130898-0065 THEN WE RETURNED TO THE LOCALITY WHERE THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ACCIDENT HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE THE OCEAN FLOOR FORMED A VALLEY
839-130898-0066 ONE HUNDRED TWENTY KILOMETERS WIDE INTO WHICH YOU COULD FIT MT BLANC WITHOUT ITS SUMMIT POKING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES THIS VALLEY IS CLOSED OFF TO THE EAST BY A SHEER WALL
839-130898-0067 TWO THOUSAND METERS HIGH WE ARRIVED THERE ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH AND THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0068 HEAD UP NORTH AND BEACH US ON THE BRITISH ISLES NO MUCH TO MY SURPRISE HE WENT BACK DOWN SOUTH AND RETURNED TO EUROPEAN SEAS AS WE SWUNG AROUND THE EMERALD ISLE
839-130898-0069 I SPOTTED CAPE CLEAR FOR AN INSTANT PLUS THE LIGHTHOUSE ON FASTNET ROCK THAT GUIDES ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF SHIPS SETTING OUT FROM GLASGOW OR LIVERPOOL AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THEN POPPED INTO MY HEAD
839-130898-0070 WOULD THE NAUTILUS DARE TO TACKLE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL NED LAND WHO PROMPTLY REAPPEARED AFTER WE HUGGED SHORE NEVER STOPPED QUESTIONING ME WHAT COULD I ANSWER HIM
839-130898-0071 AFTER GIVING THE CANADIAN A GLIMPSE OF AMERICAN SHORES WAS HE ABOUT TO SHOW ME THE COAST OF FRANCE BUT THE NAUTILUS KEPT GRAVITATING SOUTHWARD ON MAY THIRTIETH
839-130898-0072 IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
839-130898-0073 IT CLEARLY NEEDED TO HEAD EAST IT DID NOT ALL DAY LONG ON MAY THIRTY FIRST THE NAUTILUS SWEPT AROUND THE SEA IN A SERIES OF CIRCLES
839-130898-0074 THAT HAD ME DEEPLY PUZZLED IT SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR A LOCALITY THAT IT HAD SOME TROUBLE FINDING AT NOON
839-130898-0075 HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A WORD TO ME HE LOOKED GLOOMIER THAN EVER WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH SUCH SADNESS WAS IT OUR PROXIMITY TO THESE EUROPEAN SHORES WAS HE RELIVING HIS MEMORIES OF THAT COUNTRY
839-130898-0076 HE HAD LEFT BEHIND IF SO WHAT DID HE FEEL REMORSE OR REGRET FOR A GOOD WHILE THESE THOUGHTS OCCUPIED MY MIND AND I HAD A HUNCH THAT FATE WOULD SOON GIVE AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S SECRETS
839-130898-0077 THE NEXT DAY JUNE FIRST THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO THE SAME TACK IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO LOCATE SOME PRECISE SPOT IN THE OCEAN JUST AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
839-130898-0078 CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN THE SEA WAS SMOOTH THE SKIES CLEAR EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST A BIG STEAMSHIP WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON LINE NO FLAG
839-130898-0079 WAS FLAPPING FROM THE GAFF OF ITS FORE AND AFT SAIL AND I COULDN'T TELL ITS NATIONALITY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SUN PASSED ITS ZENITH
839-130898-0080 AND TOOK HIS SIGHTS WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION THE ABSOLUTE CALM OF THE WAVES FACILITATED THIS OPERATION THE NAUTILUS LAY MOTIONLESS NEITHER ROLLING NOR PITCHING I WAS ON THE PLATFORM JUST THEN
839-130898-0081 AFTER DETERMINING OUR POSITION THE CAPTAIN PRONOUNCED ONLY THESE WORDS IT'S RIGHT HERE HE WENT DOWN THE HATCH HAD HE SEEN THAT VESSEL CHANGE COURSE
839-130898-0082 AND SEEMINGLY HEAD TOWARD US I'M UNABLE TO SAY I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE THE HATCH CLOSED AND I HEARD WATER HISSING IN THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS BEGAN TO SINK
839-130898-0083 ON A VERTICAL LINE BECAUSE ITS PROPELLER WAS IN CHECK AND NO LONGER FURNISHED ANY FORWARD MOTION SOME MINUTES LATER IT STOPPED AT A DEPTH OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE METERS AND CAME TO REST ON THE SEAFLOOR
839-130898-0084 THE CEILING LIGHTS IN THE LOUNGE THEN WENT OUT THE PANELS OPENED AND THROUGH THE WINDOWS I SAW FOR A HALF MILE RADIUS THE SEA BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON'S RAYS
839-130898-0085 I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
839-130898-0086 IT WAS SOME RUIN ENSHROUDED IN A CRUST OF WHITENED SEASHELLS AS IF UNDER A MANTLE OF SNOW CAREFULLY EXAMINING THIS MASS I COULD IDENTIFY THE SWOLLEN OUTLINES OF A SHIP SHORN
839-130898-0087 OF ITS MASTS WHICH MUST HAVE SUNK BOW FIRST THIS CASUALTY CERTAINLY DATED FROM SOME FAR OFF TIME TO BE SO CAKED WITH THE LIMESTONE OF THESE WATERS
839-130898-0088 THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WHAT SHIP WAS THIS WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
839-130898-0089 I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK BUT NEXT TO ME I HEARD CAPTAIN NEMO'S VOICE SLOWLY SAY ORIGINALLY THIS SHIP WAS CHRISTENED
839-130898-0090 IT CARRIED SEVENTY FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMMANDED BY LA POYPE VERTRIEUX
839-130898-0091 IT FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST THE PRESTON ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS A MEMBER OF THE SQUADRON UNDER ADMIRAL D'ESTAING IT ASSISTED IN THE CAPTURE
839-130898-0092 OF THE ISLAND OF GRENADA ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE UNDER THE COUNT DE GRASSE IT TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF CHESAPEAKE BAY IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR
839-130898-0093 THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL
839-130898-0094 WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ESCORTING A CONVOY OF WHEAT COMING FROM AMERICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL VAN STABEL IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR
839-130898-0095 THIS SQUADRON FOUGHT AN ENCOUNTER WITH ENGLISH VESSELS SIR TODAY IS JUNE FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT OR THE THIRTEENTH DAY IN THE MONTH OF PASTURE
839-130898-0096 SEVENTY FOUR YEARS AGO TO THE DAY AT THIS VERY SPOT IN LATITUDE
839-130898-0097 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0098 ITS THREE MASTS GONE WATER IN ITS HOLD A THIRD OF ITS CREW OUT OF ACTION IT PREFERRED TO GO TO THE BOTTOM WITH ITS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX SEAMEN RATHER THAN SURRENDER AND WITH ITS FLAG
839-130898-0099 NAILED UP ON THE AFTERDECK IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES TO SHOUTS OF LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THIS IS THE AVENGER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR THE AVENGER A SPLENDID NAME
696-93314-0000 THE TWO WERE ALONE IN THE GRASSY COURTYARD OF THE RUINED CASTLE THE REST OF THE PICNIC PARTY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THEM OR THEY FROM IT OUT OF THE GREEN GROWN MOUND OF FALLEN MASONRY BY THE CORNER OF THE CHAPEL A GREAT MAY BUSH GREW
696-93314-0001 SILVERED AND PEARLED ON EVERY SCENTED STILL SPRAY THE SKY WAS DEEP CLEAR STRONG BLUE ABOVE AND AGAINST THE BLUE THE WALLFLOWERS SHONE BRAVELY FROM THE CRACKS AND CREVICES OF RUINED ARCH AND WALL AND BUTTRESS
696-93314-0002 THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
696-93314-0003 DO YOU WANT SOME HE SAID AND ON THE INSTANT HIS HAND HAD FOUND A STRONG JUTTING STONE HIS FOOT A FIRM LEDGE AND SHE SAW HIS FIGURE GREY FLANNEL AGAINST GREY STONE GO UP THE WALL TOWARDS THE YELLOW FLOWERS
696-93314-0004 OH DON'T SHE CRIED I DON'T REALLY WANT THEM PLEASE NOT I WISH THEN SHE STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND SHE KNEW THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO A MAN WHO IS CLIMBING RUINED WALLS
696-93314-0005 HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
696-93314-0006 AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
696-93314-0007 HE DROVE HIS PASSION ON THE CURB AND MASTERED IT YET THE QUESTIONS DOES SHE LOVE ME DOES SHE KNOW I LOVE HER DOES SHE WONDER WHY I DON'T SPEAK AND THE COUNTER QUESTIONS WILL SHE THINK I DON'T CARE
696-93314-0008 WHEN WE LET OUR EMOTIONS PLAY THE PRIMITIVE GAMES WITH US BUT ALWAYS THE MORNING BROUGHT STRENGTH TO KEEP TO HIS RESOLUTION HE SAW HER THREE TIMES A YEAR WHEN CHRISTMAS EASTER AND MIDSUMMER BROUGHT HER TO STAY WITH AN AUNT BROUGHT HIM HOME TO HIS PEOPLE FOR HOLIDAYS
696-93314-0009 AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET
696-93314-0010 THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL BUT THE GRATING OF HIS FEET AS HE SET THEM ON THE STONES AND THE MOVEMENT NOW AND THEN OF A BIRD IN THE IVY THEN CAME A RUSTLE A GRITTY CLATTER LOUD FALLING STONES HIS FOOT HAD SLIPPED AND HE HAD FALLEN
696-93314-0011 NO HE WAS HANGING BY HIS HANDS ABOVE THE GREAT REFECTORY ARCH AND HIS BODY SWUNG HEAVILY WITH THE IMPETUS OF THE CHECKED FALL HE WAS MOVING ALONG NOW SLOWLY HANGING BY HIS HANDS NOW HE GRASPED AN IVY ROOT ANOTHER
696-93314-0012 AND PULLED HIMSELF UP TILL HIS KNEE WAS ON THE MOULDING OF THE ARCH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED ANYONE WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT ONLY TWO MINUTES HAD BEEN LIVED BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF HIS STUMBLE AND THE OTHER MOMENT WHEN HIS FOOT TOUCHED THE GRASS
696-93314-0013 CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARMS JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOOK HIM ANGRILY AS ONE SHAKES A NAUGHTY CHILD LOOKED HIM ONCE IN THE EYES AND BURIED HER FACE IN HIS NECK SOBBING LONG DRY BREATHLESS SOBS EVEN THEN HE TRIED TO BE STRONG
696-93314-0014 DON'T HE SAID TENDERLY DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT I WAS A FOOL PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER THERE'S SOMEONE COMING I DON'T CARE SHE SAID
696-93314-0015 FOR THE TOUCH OF HIS CHEEK PRESSED AGAINST HER HAIR TOLD HER ALL THAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW LET THEM COME I DON'T CARE OH HOW COULD YOU BE SO SILLY AND HORRID
696-93314-0016 OH HOW COULD YOU OF COURSE A REALLY HONOURABLE YOUNG MAN
696-93314-0017 HE DIDN'T HE ACCEPTED IT WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND HIS LIPS AGAINST THE FACE WHERE THE TEARS NOW RAN WARM AND SALT IT WAS ONE OF THE IMMORTAL MOMENTS THE PICTURE WAS CHARMING TOO
696-93314-0018 A PICTURE TO WRING THE HEART OF THE ONLOOKER WITH ENVY OR SYMPATHY ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE ONLOOKER A MAN OF FORTY OR THEREABOUTS WHO PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT UNDER THE GREAT GATE OF THE CASTLE AND TOOK IN THE FULL CHARM AND MEANING OF THE SCENE
696-93314-0019 HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
696-93314-0020 IT'S GOT TO BE BORNE I SUPPOSE HE SAID LIKE ALL THE REST OF IT SHE'S HAPPY ENOUGH I OUGHT TO BE GLAD ANYWAY I CAN'T STOP IT PERHAPS HE SWORE A LITTLE
696-93314-0021 IF HE DID THE LESS PRECISE AND DEVOTIONAL MAY PARDON HIM HE HAD LOVED THE GIRL SINCE HER EARLY TEENS AND IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY'S POST THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM THE APPOINTMENT THAT ONE MIGHT MARRY ON THE APPOINTMENT HAD COME THROUGH HER FATHER
696-93314-0022 THE LOVER WHO CAME TO HIS LOVE OVER STREWN WALLFLOWERS DESIRED ALWAYS AS HAS BEEN SEEN TO ACT UP TO HIS MORAL IDEAS SO HE TOOK NEXT DAY A MUCH EARLIER TRAIN THAN WAS AT ALL PLEASANT
696-93314-0023 AND CALLED ON HER FATHER TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION AND SET FORTH HIS PROSPECTS HIS COMING WAS HERALDED BY A LETTER FROM HER ONE MUST NOT QUOTE IT IT IS NOT PROPER TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S LETTERS ESPECIALLY LETTERS TO A TRUSTED FATHER FROM A CHILD ONLY AND ADORED
696-93314-0024 ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
696-93314-0025 FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
696-93314-0026 AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
696-93314-0027 HE ONLY CONSENTED TO A PROVISIONAL ENGAGEMENT TOOK AN EARNEST INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN'S AFFAIRS AND OFFERED TO MAKE HIS DAUGHTER AN ANNUAL ALLOWANCE ON HER MARRIAGE AT MY DEATH SHE WILL HAVE MORE HE SAID
696-93314-0028 THE YOUNG MAN MADE A REVERENT NOTE OF THE NAME AND THE INTERVIEW SEEMED PLAYED OUT IT'S A COMPLICATED NUISANCE THE FATHER MUSED IT ISN'T EVEN AS IF I KNEW ANYTHING OF THE CHAP I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE ALLOWED THE CHILD TO MAKE THESE LONG VISITS TO HER AUNT
696-93314-0029 BUT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS TOOTHACHE ALL THE SAME HE HAD ANOTHER CALLER THAT AFTERNOON HE WHOM WE KNOW AS THE ONLOOKER CAME TO THANK HIM FOR THE INFLUENCE THAT HAD GOT HIM THE APPOINTMENT AS DOCTOR TO THE INFLUENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY THE FATHER OPENED HIS HEART TO THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0030 BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
696-93314-0031 ONE THING HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THOSE PRETTY VIVIDLY THE CONFOUNDED PUP THE ONLOOKER HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONGER THAN YOU HAVE DONE MY GOOD READER AND HE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET A GIANT TEMPTATION ANY MORE THAN YOU DO
696-93314-0032 WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
696-93314-0033 THE ILLUMINATIVE FLASH OF TEMPTATION WAS SO SUDDEN SO BRILLIANT THAT THE DOCTOR ONLOOKER CLOSED HIS SOUL'S EYES AND YIELDED WITHOUT EVEN THE LEAST PRETENCE OF RESISTANCE HE TOOK HIS STETHOSCOPE FROM THE TABLE
696-93314-0034 HE WALKED WITH MORE THAN HIS ORDINARY FIRMNESS OF GAIT AS A MAN DOES WHO IS JUST DRUNK ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE MUST TRY TO LOOK SOBER HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET CERTAIN WORDS RINGING IN HIS EARS HEART AFFECTED PROBABLY HEREDITARY WEAKNESS
696-93314-0035 NO OFFICE IN THE WORLD WOULD INSURE YOU AND SO IT WAS ALL OVER THE DREAMS THE HOPES THE PALPITATING FAITH IN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE HIS DAYS MIGHT BE LONG THEY MIGHT BE BRIEF BUT BE HIS LIFE LONG OR SHORT HE MUST LIVE IT ALONE
696-93314-0036 HE HAD A LITTLE FIGHT WITH HIMSELF AS HE WENT DOWN WIMPOLE STREET THEN HE HAILED A HANSOM AND WENT AND TOLD HER FATHER WHO QUITE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IT WAS ALL OVER THE FATHER WONDERED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING MORE SORRY THAN GLAD
696-93314-0037 SHE SAID WHY YOU WANT ME MORE THAN EVER BUT I MAY DIE AT ANY MOMENT SO MAY I AND YOU MAY LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED I'LL TAKE MY CHANCE
696-93314-0038 OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
696-93314-0039 BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
696-93314-0040 YOU'LL FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU I DIDN'T KNOW AND OH WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING YET THEY TALKED FOR HOURS CONVENTIONALLY HE SHOULD HAVE TORN HIMSELF AWAY UNABLE TO BEAR THE STRAIN OF HIS AGONY
696-93314-0041 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAT BY HER HOLDING HER HAND IT WAS FOR THE LAST TIME THE LAST LAST TIME THERE WAS REALLY A THIRD AT THAT INTERVIEW THE ONLOOKER HAD IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO SEE THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PARTING LOVERS
696-93314-0042 THEY PARTED AND NOW THE ONLOOKER DARED NOT MEET HER DARED NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE AS HE HAD USED TO DO AT LAST THE FATHER PRESSED HIM HE WENT HE MET HER AND IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD MET THE GHOST OF HER WHOM HE HAD LOVED
696-93314-0043 HER EYES HAD BLUE MARKS UNDER THEM HER CHIN HAD GROWN MORE POINTED HER NOSE SHARPER THERE WAS A NEW LINE ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER EYES HAD CHANGED OVER THE WINE HE HEARD FROM THE FATHER THAT SHE WAS PINING FOR THE LOVER WHO HAD INHERITED HEART DISEASE
696-93314-0044 I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU WHO SAW HIM BY THE WAY SAID HE A TALL WELL SET UP YOUNG FELLOW DARK NOT BAD LOOKING I I DON'T REMEMBER LIED THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0045 WITH THE EYES OF HIS MEMORY ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MAN HE HAD STABBED NOW THE LOVER AND THE ONLOOKER HAD EACH HIS OWN BURDEN TO BEAR AND THE LOVER'S WAS THE EASIER HE WORKED STILL THOUGH THERE WAS NOW NOTHING TO WORK FOR MORE
696-93314-0046 HE WORKED AS HE HAD NEVER WORKED IN HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID NOT TAKE TO WORK HE SHOULD TAKE TO DRINK OR WORSE DEVILS AND HE SET HIS TEETH AND SWORE THAT HER LOVER SHOULD NOT BE DEGRADED HE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM AND THERE WAS A KIND OF FIERCE PAIN PLEASURE
696-93314-0047 LIKE THAT OF SCRATCHING A SORE IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS WRETCHED AS HE WAS THAT DIVIDED IN ALL ELSE THEY WERE YET UNITED IN THEIR SUFFERING HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM MORE MISERABLE TO KNOW OF HER MISERY BUT IT DIDN'T HE NEVER SAW HER BUT HE DREAMED OF HER
696-93314-0048 AND SOMETIMES THE DREAMS GOT OUT OF HAND AND CARRIED HIM A THOUSAND WORLDS FROM ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM THEN HE HAD TO WAKE UP AND THAT WAS BAD BUT THE ONLOOKER WAS NO DREAMER AND HE SAW HER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK
696-93314-0049 COVERING A CLEAR CUT MASK OF SET ENDURANCE AND THERE WAS NO WORK THAT COULD SHUT OUT THAT SIGHT NO TEMPTATION OF THE WORLD THE FLESH OR THE DEVIL TO GIVE HIM EVEN THE RELIEF OF A FIGHT HE HAD NO TEMPTATIONS HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THE ONE
696-93314-0050 HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
696-93314-0051 AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
696-93314-0052 BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTS THAT THERE IS NO UNDOING AND THE HELL THAT HAD BURNED IN HIS HEART SO FIERCELY WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE OTHER MAN'S ARMS BURNED NOW WITH NEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AND INFERNAL FLICKERING FLAME TONGUES AND AT LAST OUT OF HELL
696-93314-0053 THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
696-93314-0054 YES SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY I THINK YOU ARE WRONG YOU LESSEN YOUR CHANCES OF LIFE WHY DON'T YOU TRY A COMPLETE CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU MUST KNOW MY CHANCES OF LIFE HAVE CEASED TO INTEREST ME
696-93314-0055 THE LOVER WAS SHORT WITH THE ONLOOKER BUT HE PERSISTED WELL IF ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ONE'S LIFE ONE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ONE'S DEATH OR THE MANNER OF IT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD ENLIST
696-93314-0056 IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
696-93314-0057 BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES
696-93314-0058 THAT'S ALL THE ONLOOKER GOT OUT AT THE NEXT STATION SHORT OF OWNING TO HIS OWN LIE HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO INSURE ITS BEING FOUND OUT FOR THE LIE IT WAS OR AT LEAST FOR A MISTAKE
696-93314-0059 AND WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD HE SAW THAT THE LOVER MIGHT NOT FIND IT OUT MIGHT BE PASSED FOR THE ARMY MIGHT GO TO THE FRONT MIGHT BE KILLED AND THEN WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST ANYHOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF
696-93314-0060 AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
696-93314-0061 YOU WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO SOUTH AFRICA WITHOUT TELLING HIM THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT WELL YOU KNOW BEST I SUPPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ARE YOU PERFECTLY CERTAIN
696-93314-0062 YE'LL MAK A FINE SOLDIER MY LAD I THINK NOT SAID THE LOVER AND HE WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE THIS TIME HE REELED LIKE A MAN TOO DRUNK TO CARE HOW DRUNK HE LOOKS HE DROVE IN CABS FROM HARLEY STREET TO WIMPOLE STREET
696-93314-0063 WHEN HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT LAUGH AND CRY AND CLING TO HIM WITH THIN HANDS SHE SAID DEAR I DO SO HATE TO THINK BADLY OF ANYONE BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MAN WAS MISTAKEN
696-93314-0064 HE'S VERY VERY CLEVER MY CHILD
696-93314-0065 DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
696-93314-0066 WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
696-93314-0067 I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL
4088-158079-0000 AUGUST RIOTS IMPRISONING WOMEN HAD MET WITH CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DISAPPROVAL AND ATTENDANT POLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON WOULD END THIS EMBARRASSMENT WAS DOUBTLESS THE HOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158079-0001 THE PICKETS HOWEVER RETURNED TO THEIR POSTS IN STEADILY INCREASING NUMBERS THEIR PRESENCE AT THE GATES WAS DESIRED BY THE ADMINISTRATION NO MORE NOW THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE THE ARRESTS AND IMPRISONMENTS BUT THEY HAD FOUND NO WAY TO RID THEMSELVES OF THE PICKETS
4088-158079-0002 AND AS ANOTHER MONTH OF PICKETING DREW TO AN END THE ADMINISTRATION VENTURED TO TRY OTHER WAYS TO STOP IT AND WITH IT THE CONSEQUENT EMBARRASSMENT THEIR METHODS BECAME PHYSICALLY MORE BRUTAL AND POLITICALLY MORE STUPID THEIR CONDUCT
4088-158079-0003 BECAME LAWLESS IN THE EXTREME MEANWHILE THE PRESIDENT HAD DRAFTED THE YOUNG MEN OF AMERICA IN THEIR MILLIONS TO DIE ON FOREIGN SOIL FOR FOREIGN DEMOCRACY HE HAD ISSUED A SPECIAL APPEAL TO WOMEN TO GIVE THEIR WORK THEIR TREASURE AND THEIR SONS TO THIS ENTERPRISE
4088-158079-0004 AT THE SAME TIME HIS NOW GIGANTIC FIGURE STOOD OBSTINATELY ACROSS THE PATH TO OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR DAILY TASK TO KEEP VIVIDLY IN HIS MIND THAT OBJECTIVE IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO COMPEL DECISIVE ACTION FROM HIM
4088-158079-0005 TWENTY MILLION AMERICAN WOMEN ARE NOT SELF GOVERNED TAKE THE BEAM OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE WE DID NOT EXPECT PUBLIC SYMPATHY AT THIS POINT WE KNEW THAT NOT EVEN THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD OCCASIONALLY IN DEBATE BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IN THEIR CLOAK ROOMS
4088-158079-0006 PRESIDENT AND MISSUS WILSON PASSED THROUGH THE GATES ON THEIR WAY TO A MILITARY REVIEW AT FORT MYER THE PRESIDENT SAW AMERICAN WOMEN BEING ATTACKED WHILE THE POLICE REFUSED THEM PROTECTION NOT A MOVE WAS MADE BY THE POLICE TO CONTROL THE GROWING CROWD
4088-158079-0007 SUCH INACTION IS ALWAYS A SIGNAL FOR MORE VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF ROWDIES AS THE THRONG MOVED TO AND FRO BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND OUR HEADQUARTERS IMMEDIATELY OPPOSITE SO MANY BANNERS WERE DESTROYED THAT FINALLY MISS LUCY BURNS MISS VIRGINIA ARNOLD
4088-158079-0008 AND MISS ELIZABETH STUYVESANT TOOK THOSE REMAINING TO THE SECOND AND THIRD FLOOR BALCONIES OF OUR BUILDING AND HUNG THEM OUT AT THIS POINT THERE WAS NOT A PICKET LEFT ON THE STREET THE CROWD WAS CLEARLY OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC BUT NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO MOVE THEM BACK OR TO PROTECT THE WOMEN
4088-158079-0009 CLIMBED UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR BALCONY MOUNTED THE IRON RAILING AND TORE DOWN ALL BANNERS AND THE AMERICAN FLAG ONE SAILOR ADMINISTERED A SEVERE BLOW IN THE FACE WITH HIS CLENCHED FIST UPON MISS GEORGINA STURGIS OF WASHINGTON WHY DID YOU DO THAT SHE DEMANDED
4088-158079-0010 AND STILL NO ATTEMPT BY THE POLICE TO QUELL THE RIOT THE CLIMAX CAME WHEN IN THE LATE AFTERNOON A BULLET WAS FIRED THROUGH ONE OF THE HEAVY GLASS WINDOWS OF THE SECOND FLOOR EMBEDDING ITSELF IN THE CEILING THE BULLET GRAZED PAST THE HEAD OF MISSUS ELLA MORTON DEAN OF MONTANA
4088-158079-0011 CAPTAIN FLATHER OF THE FIRST PRECINCT WITH TWO DETECTIVES LATER EXAMINED THE HOLES AND DECLARED THEY HAD BEEN MADE BY A THIRTY EIGHT CALIBER REVOLVER
4088-158079-0012 BUT THE POLICE LOOKED ON WHILE ALL THE BANNERS WERE DESTROYED A FEW PACES FROM HEADQUARTERS MORE BANNERS WENT OUT PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD ONES THEY TOO WERE DESTROYED BEFORE THEY REACHED THE WHITE HOUSE
4088-158079-0013 THIS ENTIRE SPECTACLE WAS ENACTED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH WITHIN A STONE'S THROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE MISS PAUL SUMMED UP THE SITUATION WHEN SHE SAID THE SITUATION NOW EXISTING IN WASHINGTON EXISTS BECAUSE PRESIDENT WILSON PERMITS IT
4088-158079-0014 ASKING QUESTIONS MAKING BRIEF TESTIMONIALS FROM THE FLOOR WITH ALMOST EVANGELICAL FERVOR IMPROVISED COLLECTION BASKETS WERE PILED HIGH WITH BILLS WOMEN VOLUNTEERED FOR PICKET DUTY AND CERTAIN IMPRISONMENT
4088-158079-0015 AND THE FOLLOWING DAY A DELEGATION LEFT FOR WASHINGTON I CITE THIS EXPERIENCE OF MINE BECAUSE IT WAS TYPICAL EVERY ONE WHO WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY TELLING THE STORY HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AT THIS TIME INDIGNATION WAS SWIFT AND HOT
4088-158079-0016 OUR MASS MEETINGS EVERYWHERE BECAME MEETINGS OF PROTEST DURING THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND RESOLUTIONS OF PROTEST WHICH ALWAYS WENT IMMEDIATELY BY WIRE FROM SUCH MEETINGS TO THE PRESIDENT HIS CABINET AND TO HIS LEADERS IN CONGRESS OF COURSE CREATED INCREASING
4088-158079-0017 UNEASINESS IN DEMOCRATIC CIRCLES ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE PICKETS AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO TAKE THEIR POSTS ON THE LINE ON THIS DAY ONE LETTERED BANNER AND FIFTY PURPLE WHITE AND GOLD FLAGS WERE DESTROYED BY A MOB LED BY SAILORS IN UNIFORM
4088-158079-0018 BY A SAILOR WHO TOOK HER FLAG AND THEN DARTED OFF INTO THE CROWD MISS ELIZABETH STUYVESANT WAS STRUCK BY A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM AND HER BLOUSE TORN FROM HER BODY MISS MAUD JAMISON OF VIRGINIA WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND DRAGGED ALONG THE SIDEWALK
7517-100437-0000 A HOUSEHOLD BOOK ONCE ON A TIME I DISCOVERED SAMUEL BUTLER NOT THE OTHER TWO BUT THE ONE WHO WROTE THE WAY OF ALL FLESH THE SECOND BEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
7517-100437-0001 I SAY THE SECOND BEST SO THAT IF YOU REMIND ME OF TOM JONES OR THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE OR ANY OTHER THAT YOU FANCY I CAN SAY THAT OF COURSE THAT ONE IS THE BEST
7517-100437-0002 WELL I DISCOVERED HIM JUST AS VOLTAIRE DISCOVERED HABAKKUK OR YOUR LITTLE BOY DISCOVERED SHAKESPEARE THE OTHER DAY AND I COMMITTED MY DISCOVERY TO THE WORLD
7517-100437-0003 IN TWO GLOWING ARTICLES NOT UNNATURALLY THE WORLD REMAINED UNMOVED IT KNEW ALL ABOUT SAMUEL BUTLER LAST WEEK I DISCOVERED A FRENCHMAN
7517-100437-0004 WHO WROTE IN THE EARLY PART OF LAST CENTURY A BOOK CALLED
7517-100437-0005 MY UNCLE BENJAMIN I READ IT IN THE TRANSLATION EAGER AS I AM TO BE LYRICAL ABOUT IT I SHALL REFRAIN I THINK THAT I AM PROBABLY SAFER WITH TILLIER THAN WITH BUTLER
7517-100437-0006 BUT I DARE NOT RISK IT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR SCORN AT MY PREVIOUS IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD FAMOUS TILLIER YOUR AMUSED CONTEMPT BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY JUST SUCCEEDED
7517-100437-0007 IN BORROWING THE CLASSIC UPON WHICH YOU WERE BROUGHT UP THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0008 WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF CLAUDE TILLIER
7517-100437-0009 WHO HAS NOT READ IT IN FRENCH OR AS I DID IN AMERICAN LET US PASS ON TO ANOTHER BOOK FOR I AM GOING TO SPEAK OF ANOTHER DISCOVERY
7517-100437-0010 OF A BOOK WHICH SHOULD BE A CLASSIC BUT IS NOT OF A BOOK OF WHICH NOBODY HAS HEARD UNLESS THROUGH ME IT WAS PUBLISHED SOME TWELVE YEARS AGO THE LAST PUBLISHED BOOK
7517-100437-0011 OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER WHEN I TELL YOU HIS NAME YOU WILL SAY OH YES I LOVE HIS BOOKS AND YOU WILL MENTION SO AND SO AND ITS EQUALLY FAMOUS SEQUEL SUCH AND SUCH
7517-100437-0012 BUT WHEN I ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE READ MY BOOK YOU WILL PROFESS SURPRISE AND SAY THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT IS IT AS GOOD AS SO AND SO AND SUCH AND SUCH YOU WILL ASK
7517-100437-0013 HARDLY BELIEVING THAT THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE MUCH BETTER I SHALL REPLY AND THERE IF THESE THINGS WERE ARRANGED PROPERLY WOULD BE ANOTHER TEN PER CENT IN MY POCKET BUT BELIEVE ME
7517-100437-0014 I SHALL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH YOUR GRATITUDE WELL THE WRITER OF MY BOOK IS KENNETH GRAHAME YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM GOOD I THOUGHT SO THE BOOKS YOU HAVE READ
7517-100437-0015 ARE THE GOLDEN AGE AND DREAM DAYS AM I NOT RIGHT THANK YOU BUT THE BOOK YOU HAVE NOT READ MY BOOK
7517-100437-0016 THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS AM I NOT RIGHT AGAIN AH I WAS AFRAID SO THE REASON WHY I KNEW YOU HAD NOT READ IT IS THE REASON WHY I CALL IT MY BOOK
7517-100437-0017 FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING IT USUALLY I SPEAK ABOUT IT AT MY FIRST MEETING WITH A STRANGER IT IS MY OPENING REMARK JUST AS YOURS IS SOMETHING FUTILE ABOUT THE WEATHER
7517-100437-0018 IF I DON'T GET IT IN AT THE BEGINNING I SQUEEZE IT IN AT THE END THE STRANGER HAS GOT TO HAVE IT SOME TIME SHOULD I EVER FIND MYSELF IN THE DOCK AND ONE NEVER KNOWS
7517-100437-0019 MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHETHER I HAD ANYTHING TO SAY WOULD BE WELL MY LORD IF I MIGHT JUST RECOMMEND A BOOK TO THE JURY BEFORE LEAVING MISTER JUSTICE DARLING
7517-100437-0020 WOULD PROBABLY PRETEND THAT HE HAD READ IT BUT HE WOULDN'T DECEIVE ME FOR ONE CANNOT RECOMMEND A BOOK TO ALL THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHOM ONE HAS MET IN TEN YEARS WITHOUT DISCOVERING
7517-100437-0021 WHETHER IT IS WELL KNOWN OR NOT IT IS THE AMAZING TRUTH THAT NONE OF THOSE HUNDREDS HAD HEARD OF THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS UNTIL I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0022 SOME OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD OF KENNETH GRAHAME WELL ONE DID NOT HAVE TO MEET THEM AGAIN AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD BUT MOST OF THEM WERE IN YOUR POSITION
7517-100437-0023 GREAT ADMIRERS OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS TWO EARLIER FAMOUS BOOKS BUT IGNORANT THEREAFTER I HAD THEIR PROMISE BEFORE THEY LEFT ME AND WAITED CONFIDENTLY
7517-100437-0024 FOR THEIR GRATITUDE NO DOUBT THEY ALSO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS IN THEIR TURN AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT REACHED YOU IN THIS WAY BUT IT WAS TO ME
7517-100437-0025 NONE THE LESS THAT YOUR THANKS WERE DUE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A COUPLE OF CASUAL REFERENCES TO IT AS IF IT WERE A CLASSIC KNOWN TO ALL IN A FAMOUS NOVEL
7517-100437-0026 PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IT WAS I WHO INTRODUCED THAT NOVELIST TO IT SIX MONTHS BEFORE INDEED I FEEL SOMETIMES THAT IT WAS I WHO WROTE THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS
7517-100437-0027 AND RECOMMENDED IT TO KENNETH GRAHAME BUT PERHAPS I AM WRONG HERE FOR I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE NOR AS I HAVE ALREADY LAMENTED AM I FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN ITS SALE
7517-100437-0028 AN EXPLANATION WHICH SUSPICIOUS STRANGERS REQUIRE FROM ME SOMETIMES I SHALL NOT DESCRIBE THE BOOK FOR NO DESCRIPTION WOULD HELP IT BUT I SHALL JUST SAY THIS
7517-100437-0029 THAT IT IS WHAT I CALL A HOUSEHOLD BOOK BY A HOUSEHOLD BOOK I MEAN A BOOK WHICH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD LOVES AND QUOTES CONTINUALLY EVER AFTERWARDS A BOOK WHICH IS READ ALOUD
7517-100437-0030 TO EVERY NEW GUEST AND IS REGARDED AS THE TOUCHSTONE OF HIS WORTH BUT IT IS A BOOK WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL THAT THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE LOVES IT IT IS ONLY YOU
7517-100437-0031 WHO REALLY APPRECIATE IT AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND THAT THE OTHERS ARE SCARCELY WORTHY OF IT IT IS OBVIOUS YOU PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING OF YOU
7517-100437-0032 WHEN HE WROTE IT I HOPE THIS WILL PLEASE JONES WERE HIS FINAL WORDS AS HE LAID DOWN HIS PEN WELL OF COURSE YOU WILL ORDER THE BOOK AT ONCE
7517-100437-0033 BUT I MUST GIVE YOU ONE WORD OF WARNING WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO IT DON'T BE SO RIDICULOUS AS TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON MY TASTE
7517-100437-0034 STILL LESS ON THE GENIUS OF KENNETH GRAHAME YOU ARE MERELY SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON YOURSELF YOU MAY BE WORTHY I DO NOT KNOW
7517-100442-0000 AT THE BOOKSTALL I HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO BE A GROCER TO BE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS SARDINES BOTTLED RASPBERRIES
7517-100442-0001 BISCUITS WITH SUGAR ON THE TOP PRESERVED GINGER HAMS BRAWN UNDER GLASS EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING
7517-100442-0002 AT ONE MOMENT TO WALK UP A LADDER IN SEARCH OF NUTMEG AT THE NEXT TO DIVE UNDER A COUNTER IN PURSUIT OF CINNAMON TO SERVE LITTLE GIRLS
7517-100442-0003 AND LORDLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WITH A PINT OF CHERRY GIN IS NOT THIS TO FOLLOW THE KING OF TRADES SOME DAY I SHALL OPEN A GROCER'S SHOP AND YOU WILL FIND ME IN MY SPARE EVENINGS
7517-100442-0004 APRONED BEHIND THE COUNTER LOOK OUT FOR THE CURRANTS IN THE WINDOW AS YOU COME IN I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING ARTISTIC IN THE WAY OF PATTERNS THERE BUT AS YOU LOVE ME DO NOT OFFER TO BUY ANY
7517-100442-0005 WE GROCERS ONLY PUT THE CURRANTS OUT FOR SHOW AND SO THAT WE MAY RUN OUR FINGERS THROUGH THEM LUXURIOUSLY WHEN BUSINESS IS SLACK I HAVE A GOOD LINE IN SHORTBREADS MADAM IF I CAN FIND THE BOX
7517-100442-0006 BUT NO CURRANTS THIS EVENING I BEG YOU YES TO BE A GROCER IS TO LIVE WELL BUT AFTER ALL IT IS NOT TO SEE LIFE A GROCER
7517-100442-0007 IN AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO A MAN WHO SELLS BOTH SCENTED SOAP AND PILCHARDS WOULD BECOME NARROW WE DO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD MUCH SAVE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POTTED LOBSTER
7517-100442-0008 AND TO SELL A MAN POTTED LOBSTER IS NOT TO HAVE OUR FINGERS ON HIS PULSE POTTED LOBSTER DOES NOT DEFINE A MAN ALL CUSTOMERS ARE ALIKE TO THE GROCER PROVIDED THEIR MONEY IS GOOD
7517-100442-0009 I PERCEIVE NOW THAT I WAS OVER HASTY IN DECIDING TO BECOME A GROCER THAT IS RATHER FOR ONE'S OLD AGE WHILE ONE IS YOUNG AND INTERESTED IN PERSONS RATHER THAN IN THINGS
7517-100442-0010 THERE IS ONLY ONE PROFESSION TO FOLLOW THE PROFESSION OF BOOKSTALL CLERK TO BE BEHIND A BOOKSTALL IS INDEED TO SEE LIFE THE FASCINATION OF IT STRUCK ME SUDDENLY
7517-100442-0011 LAST MONDAY AND WONDERED WHO BOUGHT THE TIE CLIPS THE ANSWER CAME TO ME JUST AS I GOT INTO MY TRAIN ASK THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOKSTALL HE WOULD KNOW
7517-100442-0012 YES AND HE WOULD KNOW WHO BOUGHT ALL HIS PAPERS AND BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS AND TO KNOW THIS IS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
7517-100442-0013 YOU CANNOT TELL A MAN BY THE LOBSTER HE EATS BUT YOU CAN TELL SOMETHING ABOUT HIM BY THE LITERATURE HE READS FOR INSTANCE I ONCE OCCUPIED A CARRIAGE ON AN EASTERN LINE
7517-100442-0014 WITH AMONG OTHERS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN AS SOON AS WE LEFT LIVERPOOL STREET SHE PRODUCED A BAG OF SHRIMPS GRASPED EACH INDIVIDUAL IN TURN FIRMLY BY THE HEAD AND TAIL
7517-100442-0015 AND ATE HIM WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE EMPTIED THE ENDS OUT OF THE WINDOW WIPED HER HANDS AND SETTLED DOWN COMFORTABLY TO HER PAPER WHAT PAPER YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
7517-100442-0016 I SHALL HAVE TO TELL YOU THE MORNING POST NOW DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU THE WOMAN THE SHRIMPS ALONE NO THE PAPER ALONE NO BUT THE TWO TO GETHER
7517-100442-0017 CONCEIVE THE HOLY JOY OF THE BOOKSTALL CLERK AS SHE AND HER BAG OF SHRIMPS YES HE COULD HAVE TOLD AT ONCE THEY WERE SHRIMPS APPROACHED AND ASKED FOR THE MORNING POST
7517-100442-0018 THE DAY CAN NEVER BE DULL TO THE BOOKSTALL CLERK I IMAGINE HIM ASSIGNING IN HIS MIND THE RIGHT PAPER TO EACH CUSTOMER THIS MAN WILL ASK FOR GOLFING WRONG
7517-100442-0019 HE WANTS CAGE BIRDS THAT ONE OVER THERE WANTS THE MOTOR AH WELL THE AUTO CAR THAT'S NEAR ENOUGH SOON HE WOULD BEGIN TO KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES HE WOULD LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
7517-100442-0020 BETWEEN THE PATRONS OF THE DANCING TIMES AND OF THE VOTE THE ERA AND THE ATHENAEUM DELIGHTFUL SURPRISES WOULD OVERWHELM HIM AT INTERVALS AS WHEN
7517-100442-0021 A RED LETTER DAY IN ALL THE GREAT STATIONS A GENTLEMAN IN A CHECK WAISTCOAT MAKES THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OF HOMER'S PENNY STORIES AND THE SPECTATOR ON THOSE OCCASIONS
7517-100442-0022 AND THEY WOULD BE VERY RARE HIS FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE WOULD BEGIN TO OOZE AWAY UNTIL ALL AT ONCE HE WOULD TELL HIMSELF EXCITEDLY THAT THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL IN DISGUISE
7517-100442-0023 RATHER OVERDOING THE PART AFTER WHICH HE WOULD HAND OVER THE WINNING POST AND THE ANIMALS FRIEND TO THE PURSUING DETECTIVE IN A SORT OF HOLY AWE WHAT A LIFE
7517-100442-0024 BUT HE HAS OTHER THINGS THAN PAPERS TO SELL HE KNOWS WHO BUYS THOSE LITTLE SIXPENNY BOOKS OF FUNNY STORIES A PROBLEM WHICH HAS OFTEN PUZZLED US OTHERS
7517-100442-0025 HE UNDERSTANDS BY NOW THE TYPE OF MAN WHO WANTS TO READ UP A FEW GOOD JOKES TO TELL THEM DOWN AT OLD ROBINSON'S WHERE HE IS GOING FOR THE WEEK END OUR BOOKSTALL CLERK DOESN'T WAIT TO BE ASKED
7517-100442-0026 AS SOON AS THIS GENTLEMAN APPROACHES HE WHIPS OUT THE BOOK DUSTS IT AND PLACES IT BEFORE THE RACONTEUR HE RECOGNIZES ALSO AT A GLANCE THE SORT OF SILLY ASS
7517-100442-0027 WHO IS ALWAYS LOSING HIS INDIARUBBER UMBRELLA RING HALF WAY ACROSS THE STATION HE CAN SEE HIM AND HE HASTENS TO GET A NEW CARD OUT IN READINESS OR WE WOULD LET YOU HAVE SEVEN FOR SIXPENCE SIR
7517-100442-0028 AND EVEN WHEN ONE OF THOSE SUBTLER CHARACTERS DRAWS NEAR ABOUT WHOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IMMEDIATELY WHETHER THEY REQUIRE A FOUNTAIN PEN WITH CASE OR THE LIFE AND LETTERS
7517-100442-0029 OF MAJOR GENERAL CLEMENT BULGER C B EVEN THEN THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOKSTALL IS NOT FOUND WANTING IF HE IS WRONG THE FIRST TIME HE NEVER FAILS TO RECOVER WITH HIS SECOND BULGER SIR
7517-100442-0030 ONE OF OUR GREATEST SOLDIERS I THOUGHT OF THESE THINGS LAST MONDAY AND DEFINITELY RENOUNCED THE IDEA OF BECOMING A GROCER AND AS I WANDERED ROUND THE BOOKSTALL THINKING
7517-100442-0031 I CAME ACROSS A LITTLE BOOK SIXPENCE IN CLOTH A SHILLING IN LEATHER CALLED PROVERBS AND MAXIMS IT CONTAINED SOME THOUSANDS OF THE BEST THOUGHTS IN ALL LANGUAGES
7517-100442-0032 SUCH AS HAVE GUIDED MEN ALONG THE PATH OF TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD FROM WHAT HO SHE BUMPS TO ICH DIEN AND MORE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
7517-100442-0033 THAT AN INTERESTING ARTICLE MIGHT BE EXTRACTED FROM IT SO I BOUGHT THE BOOK UNFORTUNATELY ENOUGH I LEFT IT IN THE TRAIN BEFORE I HAD TIME TO MASTER IT I SHALL BE AT THE BOOKSTALL NEXT MONDAY
7517-100442-0034 AND I SHALL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER COPY THAT WILL BE ALL RIGHT YOU SHAN'T MISS IT BUT I AM WONDERING NOW WHAT THE BOOKSTALL CLERK WILL MAKE OF ME A MAN WHO KEEPS ON BUYING PROVERBS AND MAXIMS
4297-13009-0000 THEY WERE HABITUALLY INDIFFERENT TO SELF EXALTATION AND ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THRUST INTO THIS OR THAT UNFITTING ROLE PROFESSING THAT THE QUEEN'S GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WERE THEIR ONLY CONSIDERATIONS
4297-13009-0001 BECAUSE IT WAS FELT ON ALL SIDES THAT SIR ORLANDO COULD NOT JOIN THE NEW COMPOSITE PARTY WITHOUT HIGH PLACE AND THE SAME GRACE WAS SHOWN IN REGARD TO LORD DRUMMOND WHO REMAINED AT THE COLONIES KEEPING THE OFFICE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LATELY TRANSFERRED UNDER MISTER DAUBENY
4297-13009-0002 FOR LEGAL OFFICES HAVE A SIGNIFICATION DIFFERING MUCH FROM THAT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO PLACES SIMPLY POLITICAL A LORD CHANCELLOR BECOMES A PEER AND ON GOING OUT OF OFFICE ENJOYS A LARGE PENSION WHEN THE WOOLSACK HAS BEEN REACHED THERE COMES AN END OF DOUBT
4297-13009-0003 AND A BEGINNING OF EASE SIR GREGORY WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN AND THIS WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW BUT HE BORE IT MANFULLY SAYING NOT A WORD WHEN THE DUKE SPOKE TO HIM BUT HE BECAME CONVINCED FROM THAT MOMENT THAT NO MORE INEFFICIENT LAWYER EVER SAT UPON THE ENGLISH BENCH
4297-13009-0004 OR A MORE PRESUMPTUOUS POLITICIAN IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAN LORD RAMSDEN THE REAL STRUGGLE HOWEVER LAY IN THE APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATTLERS AND THE ROBYS THE FITZGIBBONS AND THE MACPHERSONS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICES OF STATE
4297-13009-0005 MISTER MACPHERSON AND MISTER ROBY WITH A HOST OF OTHERS WHO HAD BELONGED TO MISTER DAUBENY WERE PREPARED AS THEY DECLARED FROM THE FIRST TO LEND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE DUKE THEY HAD CONSULTED MISTER DAUBENY ON THE SUBJECT AND MISTER DAUBENY TOLD THEM THAT THEIR DUTY LAY IN THAT DIRECTION
4297-13009-0006 AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
4297-13009-0007 HE WAS ASTOUNDED NOT SO MUCH BY THE PRETENSIONS AS BY THE UNBLUSHING ASSERTION OF THESE PRETENSIONS IN REFERENCE TO PLACES WHICH HE HAD BEEN INNOCENT ENOUGH TO THINK WERE ALWAYS BESTOWED AT ANY RATE WITHOUT DIRECT APPLICATION HE HAD MEASURED HIMSELF RIGHTLY WHEN HE TOLD THE OLDER DUKE
4297-13009-0008 IN ONE OF THOSE ANXIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BEFORE THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE THAT LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE HIMSELF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAY OF BESTOWING OFFICE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
4297-13009-0009 ONE ON THE HEELS OF THE OTHER EACH ASSURING ME NOT ONLY THAT THE WHOLE STABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE DEPENDS ON MY GIVING A CERTAIN OFFICE TO HIM BUT ACTUALLY TELLING ME TO MY FACE THAT I HAD PROMISED IT TO HIM THE OLD STATESMAN LAUGHED
4297-13009-0010 TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
4297-13009-0011 THEY ALWAYS HAD A LEANING TO EACH OTHER AND NOW I HEAR THEY PASS THEIR TIME BETWEEN THE STEPS OF THE CARLTON AND REFORM CLUBS BUT WHAT AM I TO DO ONE MUST BE PATRONAGE SECRETARY NO DOUBT THEY'RE BOTH GOOD MEN IN THEIR WAY YOU KNOW
4297-13009-0012 BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE DOGS CRAVING A BONE IT USED NOT TO BE SO OF COURSE MEN WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS FOR OFFICE AS THEY ARE NOW WELL YES WE'VE HEARD OF THAT BEFORE TO DAY I THINK
4297-13009-0013 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
4297-13009-0014 WHETHER IT IS MORE DISHONEST AND WHETHER STRUGGLES WERE NOT MADE QUITE AS DISGRACEFUL TO THE STRUGGLERS AS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE NOW YOU CAN'T ALTER THE MEN AND YOU MUST USE THEM THE YOUNGER DUKE SAT DOWN AND SIGHED OVER THE DEGENERATE PATRIOTISM OF THE AGE
4297-13009-0015 BUT AT LAST EVEN THE RATTLERS AND ROBYS WERE FIXED IF NOT SATISFIED AND A COMPLETE LIST OF THE MINISTRY APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS THOUGH THE THING HAD BEEN LONG A DOING STILL IT HAD COME SUDDENLY
4297-13009-0016 SO THAT AT THE FIRST PROPOSITION TO FORM A COALITION MINISTRY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD HARDLY KNOWN WHETHER TO ASSIST OR TO OPPOSE THE SCHEME THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ALL THESE EDITORS AND CONTRIBUTORS THE TEACHING OF A TRADITION THAT COALITIONS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FEEBLE
4297-13009-0017 SOMETIMES DISASTROUS AND ON OCCASIONS EVEN DISGRACEFUL WHEN A MAN PERHAPS THROUGH A LONG POLITICAL LIFE HAS BOUND HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN CODE OF OPINIONS HOW CAN HE CHANGE THAT CODE AT A MOMENT
4297-13009-0018 AND WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGE HE SECURES POWER PATRONAGE AND PAY HOW SHALL THE PUBLIC VOICE ABSOLVE HIM BUT THEN AGAIN MEN WHO HAVE BY THE WORK OF THEIR LIVES GROWN INTO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
4297-13009-0019 AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
4297-13009-0020 THIS ALSO THE NEWSPAPERS PERCEIVED AND HAVING SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION BEEN VERY LOUD IN EXPOSING THE DISGRACEFUL COLLAPSE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COULD HARDLY REFUSE THEIR SUPPORT TO ANY ATTEMPT AT A FEASIBLE ARRANGEMENT
4297-13009-0021 WHEN IT WAS FIRST KNOWN THAT THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAD CONSENTED TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT THEY HAD BOTH ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER BEEN LOUD IN HIS PRAISE GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN ENGLAND WHO COULD DO THE WORK
4297-13009-0022 BUT WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN FOR THE OCCASION HOW COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN CREDITING HIMSELF IN PREFERENCE TO THEM THE WORK IN PARLIAMENT BEGAN UNDER THE NEW AUSPICES WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY
4297-13009-0023 AND FURTHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS ALL MEN KNEW WHO KNEW ANYTHING BUT FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE MONTH EVEN PERHAPS FOR THE SESSION THERE WAS TO BE PEACE WITH FULL LATITUDE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUTINE DUTIES THERE WAS SO TO SAY NO OPPOSITION
4297-13009-0024 AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED THAT ONE SPECIAL BENCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD REMAIN UNOCCUPIED BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO ON ONE OF WHICH MISTER DAUBENY HAD BEEN SEEN SITTING JUST BELOW THE GANGWAY THAT GENTLEMAN RETURNED TO THE PLACE USUALLY HELD BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RIVAL
4297-13009-0025 SAYING WITH A SMILE THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE SEAT SHOULD BE UTILISED MISTER GRESHAM AT THIS TIME HAD WITH DECLARED PURPOSE ASKED AND OBTAINED THE SPEAKER'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WAS ABROAD WHO SHOULD LEAD THE HOUSE
4297-13009-0026 THAT HAD BEEN A GREAT QUESTION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND WHAT OFFICE SHOULD THE LEADER HOLD MISTER MONK HAD CONSENTED TO TAKE THE EXCHEQUER
4297-13009-0027 WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
4297-13009-0028 THE FACT IS SAID ROBY THAT WE'VE TRUSTED TO TWO MEN SO LONG THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE BIG ENOUGH TO FILL THEIR PLACES MONK WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE HOUSE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONK I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE WILSON
4297-13009-0029 AND SO I TOLD THE DUKE HE HAD AN IDEA THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE OF YOUR MEN I THINK HE'S RIGHT THERE SAID ROBY THERE OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A FAIR DIVISION INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE CONTENT BUT THE PARTY WOULD BE DISSATISFIED
4297-13009-0030 FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
4297-13009-0031 OF COURSE I WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT I HAD BEEN TOO THOROUGHLY A PARTY MAN FOR A NEW MOVEMENT OF THIS KIND BUT HE SAID JUST THE SAME THAT HE CONSIDERED I WAS BOUND TO JOIN HIM I ASKED GRESHAM AND WHEN GRESHAM SAID SO TOO OF COURSE I HAD NO HELP FOR IT
4297-13009-0032 A MEANING TO A MAN'S WORDS EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH ANOTHER TONE WOULD CONVEY OR IF HE DOES LIE IN DOING SO HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE LIES MISTER RATTLER HAD GONE BACK TO HIS OLD OFFICE AT THE TREASURY
4297-13009-0033 AND MISTER ROBY HAD BEEN FORCED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE SECRETARYSHIP AT THE ADMIRALTY BUT AS THE OLD DUKE HAD SAID THEY WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND PREPARED TO FIGHT TOGETHER ANY BATTLE WHICH MIGHT KEEP THEM IN THEIR PRESENT POSITION
4297-13009-0034 MANY OF THE CARES OF OFFICE THE PRIME MINISTER DID SUCCEED IN SHUFFLING OFF ALTOGETHER ON TO THE SHOULDERS OF HIS ELDER FRIEND HE WOULD NOT CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF LADIES ABOUT WHOM HE SAID HE KNEW NOTHING
4297-13009-0035 AND AS TO WHOSE FITNESS AND CLAIMS HE PROFESSED HIMSELF TO BE AS IGNORANT AS THE OFFICE MESSENGER THE OFFERS WERE OF COURSE MADE IN THE USUAL FORM AS THOUGH COMING DIRECT FROM THE QUEEN THROUGH THE PRIME MINISTER BUT THE SELECTIONS WERE IN TRUTH EFFECTED BY THE OLD DUKE IN COUNCIL WITH
4297-13009-0036 AN ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE THE MATTER AFFECTED OUR DUKE ONLY IN SO FAR THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS MIND THAT STRANGE APPLICATION FROM HIS OWN WIFE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE EVEN DREAMED OF IT HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF
4297-13009-0037 THE DESIRE FOR PLOUGHING HAD COME UPON THE DUCHESS BUT THE DUKE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT HE PERCEIVED HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF HIS OFFICIAL WORK THAT HIS REFUSAL SAT HEAVILY ON HIS WIFE'S BREAST AND THAT THOUGH SHE SPOKE NO FURTHER WORD
4297-13009-0038 SHE BROODED OVER HER INJURY AND HIS HEART WAS SAD WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD VEXED HER LOVING HER AS HE DID WITH ALL HIS HEART BUT WITH A HEART THAT WAS NEVER DEMONSTRATIVE WHEN SHE WAS UNHAPPY HE WAS MISERABLE
4297-13009-0039 THOUGH HE WOULD HARDLY KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS MISERY HER RIDICULE AND RAILLERY HE COULD BEAR
4297-13009-0040 OR HER SULLENNESS IF EVER SHE WERE SULLEN UPSET HIM ALTOGETHER HE WAS IN TRUTH SO SOFT OF HEART
4297-13009-0041 HE HAD EXPRESSLY ASKED HER FOR HER SYMPATHY IN THE BUSINESS HE HAD ON HAND THEREBY GOING MUCH BEYOND HIS USUAL COLDNESS OF MANNER
4297-13009-0042 HAD PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD SLAVE FOR HIM IF SLAVERY WERE NECESSARY THEN SHE HAD MADE HER REQUEST HAD BEEN REFUSED AND WAS NOW MOODY THE DUCHESS OF
4297-13009-0043 IS TO BE MISTRESS OF THE ROBES HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY HE HAD GONE TO HER UP TO HER OWN ROOM BEFORE HE DRESSED FOR DINNER HAVING DEVOTED MUCH MORE TIME THAN AS PRIME MINISTER HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE TO A RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD MAKE THINGS STRAIGHT WITH HER AND TO THE BEST WAY OF DOING IT
4297-13009-0044 SO I AM TOLD SHE OUGHT TO KNOW HER WAY ABOUT THE PLACE AS I REMEMBER SHE WAS AT THE SAME WORK WHEN I WAS A GIRL OF ELEVEN THAT'S NOT SO VERY LONG AGO CORA SILVERBRIDGE IS OLDER NOW THAN I WAS THEN
4297-13009-0045 AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT A VERY LONG TIME AGO LORD SILVERBRIDGE WAS THE DUKE'S ELDEST SON BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF SHE BEGAN HER CAREER IN THE TIME OF GEORGE THE FOURTH WHAT IS IT TO YOU
4297-13009-0046 IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT REMEMBER HERS IN THE WAY SHE DRESSES SAID THE DUCHESS THIS WAS MARVELLOUS TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE
4297-13009-0047 THAT IT WON'T COME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY OFFICE TO EFFECT OR EVEN TO PROPOSE ANY RADICAL CHANGE IN HER GRACE'S APPAREL BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU AND I CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE ALL THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SHE MAY BE AN ANTIQUATED EVE FOR ME
4297-13009-0048 I HOPE CORA YOU ARE NOT STILL DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I DID NOT AGREE WITH YOU WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE PLACE FOR YOURSELF NOT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT AGREE WITH ME BUT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT THINK ME FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH ANY JUDGMENT OF MY OWN
4297-13009-0049 AND FREE FROM BONDS BY WHICH THEY ARE CRAMPED AND CONFINED OF COURSE SUCH A TURN OF CHARACTER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DANGERS OF ITS OWN THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DANGERS THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHEN I SEE HER GRACE I SHALL TELL HER WHAT I THINK ABOUT HER
4297-13009-0050 YOU WILL I AM SURE SAY NOTHING UNKIND TO A LADY WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE PLACE SHE NOW FILLS BY MY AUTHORITY BUT DO NOT LET US QUARREL ABOUT AN OLD WOMAN I WON'T QUARREL WITH YOU EVEN ABOUT A YOUNG ONE
4297-13009-0051 YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE
4297-13009-0052 THAT HER ANGER ABOUT THE ROBES WAS APPEASED I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASKED ABOUT A FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAID THIS OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL AND PERFECTED LIST OF THE NEW MEN HAD APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT FRIEND
4297-13009-0053 MISTER FINN IS TO GO TO IRELAND GO TO IRELAND HOW DO YOU MEAN IT IS LOOKED UPON AS BEING VERY GREAT PROMOTION INDEED I AM TOLD THAT HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE LUCKIEST MAN IN ALL THE SCRAMBLE YOU DON'T MEAN AS CHIEF SECRETARY
4297-13009-0054 YES I DO HE CERTAINLY COULDN'T GO AS LORD LIEUTENANT BUT THEY SAID THAT BARRINGTON ERLE WAS GOING TO IRELAND WELL YES I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED BY ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF IT
4297-13009-0055 THE ONE MAN IN PARLIAMENT MODEST ENOUGH NOT TO CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE FIT FOR ANY PLACE THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO HIM POOR BARRINGTON HE DOES NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF CROSSING THE CHANNEL SO OFTEN I QUITE SYMPATHISE WITH HIM AND SO PHINEAS IS TO BE SECRETARY FOR IRELAND
4297-13009-0056 NOT IN THE CABINET NO NOT IN THE CABINET IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS USUAL THAT HE SHOULD BE THAT IS PROMOTION AND I AM GLAD POOR PHINEAS I HOPE THEY WON'T MURDER HIM OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
4297-13009-0057 THEY DO MURDER PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES HE'S AN IRISHMAN HIMSELF THAT'S JUST THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HE MUST PUT UP WITH THAT OF COURSE I WONDER WHETHER SHE'LL LIKE GOING THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY WHICH THEY ALWAYS LIKE
4297-13009-0058 OVER THERE HE COMES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS EVERY WEEK DOESN'T HE NOT QUITE THAT I BELIEVE I SHALL MISS HER IF SHE HAS TO STAY AWAY LONG I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE HER I DO LIKE HER
4297-13009-0059 SHE HAS ALWAYS BEHAVED WELL BOTH TO ME AND TO MY UNCLE SHE WAS AN ANGEL TO HIM
4297-13009-0060 THIS SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH NOT MEANING IT ALTOGETHER BUT YET HALF MEANING IT I HAVE ASKED HIM TO UNDERTAKE THE OFFICE SAID THE DUKE SOLEMNLY BECAUSE I AM TOLD THAT HE IS FIT FOR IT
4297-13009-0061 BUT I DID HAVE SOME PLEASURE IN PROPOSING IT TO HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU IT DOES PLEASE ME AND I WON'T BE CROSS ANY MORE AND THE DUCHESS OF
4297-13009-0062 BUT SHE IS IN TRUTH THE ONLY WOMAN IN LONDON TO WHOM I CAN SAY WHAT I THINK AND IT IS A COMFORT YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME ONE IN THIS WAY THE DOMESTIC PEACE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS READJUSTED
4297-13009-0063 AND THAT SYMPATHY AND CO OPERATION FOR WHICH HE HAD FIRST ASKED WAS ACCORDED TO HIM IT MAY BE A QUESTION WHETHER ON THE WHOLE THE DUCHESS DID NOT WORK HARDER THAN HE DID
4297-13009-0064 IN REGARD TO MAGNIFICENCE AND HOSPITALITY SHE SAID NOTHING OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE OF MONEY BUT SHE SET HERSELF TO WORK AFTER HER OWN FASHION MAKING TO HIM SUGGESTIONS AS TO DINNERS AND EVENING RECEPTIONS
4297-13009-0065 TO WHICH HE OBJECTED ONLY ON THE SCORE OF TIME YOU MUST EAT YOUR DINNER SOMEWHERE SHE SAID AND YOU NEED ONLY COME IN JUST BEFORE WE SIT DOWN AND GO INTO YOUR OWN ROOM IF YOU PLEASE WITHOUT COMING UPSTAIRS AT ALL I CAN AT ANY RATE DO THAT PART OF IT FOR YOU
730-360-0000 I NOW HASTEN TO THE MORE MOVING PART OF MY STORY I SHALL RELATE EVENTS THAT IMPRESSED ME WITH FEELINGS WHICH FROM WHAT I HAD BEEN HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM
730-360-0001 IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMY SHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE
730-360-0002 MY SENSES WERE GRATIFIED AND REFRESHED BY A THOUSAND SCENTS OF DELIGHT AND A THOUSAND SIGHTS OF BEAUTY IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN MY COTTAGERS PERIODICALLY RESTED FROM LABOUR THE OLD MAN PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
730-360-0003 THAT I OBSERVED THE COUNTENANCE OF FELIX WAS MELANCHOLY BEYOND EXPRESSION HE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND ONCE HIS FATHER PAUSED IN HIS MUSIC AND I CONJECTURED
730-360-0004 THAT HE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF HIS SON'S SORROW FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRY MAN AS A GUIDE
730-360-0005 THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BY PRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX
730-360-0006 ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
730-360-0007 AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR
730-360-0008 EVERY TRAIT OF SORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF ECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE
730-360-0009 SHE APPEARED AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT FEELINGS WIPING A FEW TEARS FROM HER LOVELY EYES
730-360-0010 SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
730-360-0011 AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS HAND BUT HE RAISED HER AND EMBRACED HER AFFECTIONATELY
730-360-0012 SHE WAS NEITHER UNDERSTOOD BY NOR HERSELF UNDERSTOOD THE COTTAGERS THEY MADE MANY SIGNS WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND BUT I SAW THAT HER PRESENCE DIFFUSED GLADNESS THROUGH THE COTTAGE DISPELLING THEIR SORROW AS THE SUN DISSIPATES THE MORNING MISTS
730-360-0013 AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
730-360-0014 PRESENTLY I FOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGER REPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END
730-360-0015 RETIRED EARLY WHEN THEY SEPARATED FELIX KISSED THE HAND OF THE STRANGER AND SAID GOOD NIGHT SWEET SAFIE HE SAT UP MUCH LONGER CONVERSING WITH HIS FATHER AND BY THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF HER NAME I CONJECTURED THAT THEIR LOVELY GUEST
730-360-0016 WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
730-360-0017 AND AFTER THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THE OLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MY EYES
730-360-0018 WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE GAVE THE GUITAR TO AGATHA WHO AT FIRST DECLINED IT SHE PLAYED A SIMPLE AIR AND HER VOICE ACCOMPANIED IT IN SWEET ACCENTS BUT UNLIKE THE WONDROUS STRAIN OF THE STRANGER
730-360-0019 THE OLD MAN APPEARED ENRAPTURED AND SAID SOME WORDS WHICH AGATHA ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO SAFIE AND BY WHICH HE APPEARED TO WISH TO EXPRESS THAT SHE BESTOWED ON HIM THE GREATEST DELIGHT BY HER MUSIC
730-360-0020 THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATION THAT
730-360-0021 IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY FRIENDS SAFIE WAS ALWAYS GAY AND HAPPY SHE AND I IMPROVED RAPIDLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE SO THAT IN TWO MONTHS I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND MOST OF THE WORDS UTTERED BY MY PROTECTORS
730-360-0022 IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE AND THE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THE SCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODS THE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY
730-360-0023 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVER VENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT
730-360-0024 MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILY MASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST
730-360-0025 WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKEN ACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS AS IT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME
730-360-0026 THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEY'S RUINS OF EMPIRES I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOT FELIX IN READING IT
730-360-0027 HE HAD CHOSEN THIS WORK HE SAID BECAUSE THE DECLAMATORY STYLE WAS FRAMED IN IMITATION OF THE EASTERN AUTHORS
730-360-0028 AND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE EARTH
730-360-0029 DEGENERATING OF THE DECLINE OF THAT MIGHTY EMPIRE OF CHIVALRY CHRISTIANITY AND KINGS I HEARD OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE
730-360-0030 INHABITANTS THESE WONDERFUL NARRATIONS INSPIRED ME WITH STRANGE FEELINGS WAS MAN INDEED AT ONCE SO POWERFUL SO VIRTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT YET SO VICIOUS AND BASE
730-360-0031 AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE AND GODLIKE TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOUR THAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ON RECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED
730-360-0032 A CONDITION MORE ABJECT THAN THAT
730-360-0033 OR EVEN WHY THERE WERE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT WHEN I HEARD DETAILS OF VICE AND BLOODSHED MY WONDER CEASED AND I TURNED AWAY WITH DISGUST AND LOATHING EVERY CONVERSATION OF THE COTTAGERS NOW OPENED NEW WONDERS TO ME
730-360-0034 I HEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALID POVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD
730-360-0035 UNITED WITH RICHES A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDERED EXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TO WASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW
730-360-0036 AND WHAT WAS I OF MY CREATION AND CREATOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT I KNEW THAT I POSSESSED NO MONEY NO FRIENDS NO KIND OF PROPERTY
730-360-0037 SENSATIONS OF HUNGER THIRST AND HEAT OF WHAT A STRANGE NATURE IS KNOWLEDGE
730-360-0038 AND THAT WAS DEATH A STATE WHICH I FEARED YET DID NOT UNDERSTAND
730-360-0039 EXCEPT THROUGH MEANS WHICH I OBTAINED BY STEALTH
730-360-0040 MISERABLE UNHAPPY WRETCH OTHER LESSONS WERE IMPRESSED UPON ME EVEN MORE DEEPLY
730-360-0041 HOW THE FATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT
730-360-0042 NO MOTHER HAD BLESSED ME WITH SMILES AND CARESSES
730-360-0043 ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH I DISTINGUISHED NOTHING FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS I THEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION
730-360-0044 I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BEING RESEMBLING ME OR WHO CLAIMED ANY INTERCOURSE WITH ME WHAT WAS I
730-359-0000 I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP I THOUGHT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT
730-359-0001 WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
730-359-0002 THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
730-359-0003 EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
730-359-0004 AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
730-359-0005 THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
730-359-0006 IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
730-359-0007 THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
730-359-0008 A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
730-359-0009 IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
730-359-0010 WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
730-359-0011 THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED DURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWN CONSUMPTION
730-359-0012 I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
730-359-0013 AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
730-359-0014 THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
730-359-0015 SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
730-359-0016 BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
730-359-0017 I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
730-359-0018 BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
730-359-0019 NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER
730-359-0020 AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
730-359-0021 BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLY ONE WHICH WAS FATHER THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER OR AGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT
730-359-0022 WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
730-359-0023 AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
730-359-0024 WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY I FELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR JOYS
730-359-0025 OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THAT HE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY
730-359-0026 AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED
730-359-0027 AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER IT WAS NOT THUS WITH FELIX HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HIS FRIENDS
730-359-0028 BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
730-359-0029 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
730-359-0030 IN THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND WANT
730-359-0031 FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
730-359-0032 WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
730-359-0033 HE READ TO THE OLD MAN AND AGATHA THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES I DISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHEN HE TALKED I CONJECTURED THEREFORE
730-359-0034 THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNS FOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHEND THESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVER SENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE
730-359-0035 OF CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR
730-359-0036 TO DISCOVER MYSELF TO THE COTTAGERS
730-359-0037 WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
730-359-0038 AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER
730-359-0039 FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
730-359-0040 AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
730-359-0041 MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM DURING THE MORNING I ATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN OBSERVING MY FRIENDS
730-359-0042 WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
730-359-0043 AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
730-359-0044 MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
730-359-0045 THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TO THESE DESERVING PEOPLE WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THE VENERABLE BLIND FATHER
730-359-0046 I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL
730-359-0047 AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TO THE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUT SUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIR TONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE
730-359-0048 GREATLY ALTERED THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN HID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OF CULTIVATION
730-359-0049 HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
730-359-0050 MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
4160-11550-0000 MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE HAS GONE AWAY HE WILL NOT COME BACK AGAIN UNTIL JULY WHEN HE IS TO MARRY MISS GOWER THIS WAS THE LAST ENTRY RECORDED IN THE LITTLE PINK AND GOLD JOURNAL AND AFTER IT CAME A GAP OF MONTHS
4160-11550-0001 IT WAS MIDNIGHT AFTER THE MEMORABLE DAY SPENT IN BROOME STREET THAT THE RECORD WAS MADE AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH SHUT THE BOOK WITH A STARTLED FEELING THAT SHE HAD SHUT WITHIN ITS PAGES AN UNFINISHED PAGE OF HER LIFE IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING TO HAVE COME UPON HER SO SUDDENLY
4160-11550-0002 IT WAS STARTLING IT HAD COME UPON HER WITHOUT A MOMENT'S WARNING IT SEEMED AND YET IF SHE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF IT THERE HAD BEEN WARNING ENOUGH WARNING ENOUGH FOR AN OLDER WOMAN WARNING ENOUGH FOR DENIS OGLETHORPE
4160-11550-0003 BUT IT HAD NOT SEEMED WARNING TO A GIRL OF SCARCELY SEVENTEEN YEARS BUT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT NOW SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD IT THE MOMENT HE TOLD HER IN THAT STRAINED STEADY VOICE THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY SHE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE TO LADY THROCKMORTON
4160-11550-0004 AND LISTENED QUIETLY TO HER WANDERING COMMENTS ANSWERING THEM AS BEST SHE COULD SHE HAD WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL SIR DUGALD'S BARBAROUS ELEVEN O'CLOCK SUPPER WAS OVER AND THEN SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM STIRRED THE FIRE AND DROPPED DOWN UPON THE HEARTH RUG TO THINK IT OVER
4160-11550-0005 SHE THOUGHT OVER IT FOR A LONG TIME HER HANDSOME EYES BROODING OVER THE RED COALS BUT AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR SHE SPOKE OUT ALOUD TO THE SILENCE OF THE ROOM HE LOVED ME SHE SAID HE LOVED ME ME POOR PRISCILLA
4160-11550-0006 THAT SHE WOULD RATHER LOSE HIM KNOWING HE LOVED HER THAN WIN HIM FEELING UNCERTAIN THE GLOW IN HER EYES DIED AWAY IN TEARS BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO REALIZE DESPAIR OR ANYTHING LIKE IT THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE CURIOUS ENCHANTMENT OF THE DAY HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER SAD
4160-11550-0007 AND AT SEVENTEEN ONE DOES NOT COMPREHEND THAT FATE CAN BE WHOLLY BITTER OR THAT SOME TURN IN FORTUNE IS NOT IN STORE FOR THE FUTURE HOWEVER HOPELESS THE PRESENT MAY SEEM IN THIS MOOD THE ENTRY WAS MADE IN THE LITTLE JOURNAL AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH CRIED A LITTLE HOPED A LITTLE
4160-11550-0008 AND WONDERED GUILELESSLY HOW MATTERS COULD END WITH PERFECT JUSTICE TO PRISCILLA GOWER THE HOUSEHOLD SEEMED RATHER QUIET AFTER THE CHANGE MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS A MAN TO BE MISSED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEO WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO MISSED HIM
4160-11550-0009 LADY THROCKMORTON MISSED HIM ALSO BUT SHE HAD THE SOLACE OF HER NOVELS AND HER CHOCOLATE WHICH THEO HAD NOT NOVELS HAD BEEN DELIGHTFUL AT DOWNPORT WHEN THEY WERE READ IN HOURLY FEAR OF THE TASKS THAT ALWAYS INTERFERED TO PREVENT ANY INDULGENCE
4160-11550-0010 BUT IN THOSE DAYS FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE NOT AS SATISFACTORY AS THEY APPEARED ONCE AND SO BEING THROWN ON HER OWN RESOURCES SHE SUCCUMBED TO THE VERY NATURAL GIRLISH WEAKNESS OF FEELING A SORT OF FASCINATION FOR BROOME STREET IT WAS HARD TO RESIST BROOME STREET
4160-11550-0011 THIS WAS A CURIOUS CONSOLATION THE TWO SPENT HOURS TOGETHER SOMETIMES IN THE TINY PARLOR STUMBLING OVER BERLIN WOOL DIFFICULTIES AND NOW AND THEN WANDERING TO AND FRO CONVERSATIONALLY FROM PRISCILLA TO THE OCTAGON STITCH AND FROM THE OCTAGON STITCH TO DENIS
4160-11550-0012 AND SHE WAS SURE HER PALE HANDSOME FACE WAS PALER THOUGH OF COURSE THAT WAS EASILY TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY HER LOVER'S ABSENCE SHE WAS A SINGULAR GIRL THIS PRISCILLA GOWER THE FIRST TIME THEO EVER SAW HER DISPLAY AN INTEREST IN ANYBODY OR IN ANYTHING
4160-11550-0013 WAS WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD PAMELA'S LOVE STORY MENTIONED SHE WAS SITTING AT WORK NEAR THEM WHEN THEO CHANCED TO MENTION ARTHUR BRUNWALDE AND TO HER SURPRISE PRISCILLA LOOKED UP FROM HER DESK IMMEDIATELY HE WAS YOUR SISTER'S LOVER WAS HE NOT SHE SAID WITH AN ABRUPT INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT
4160-11550-0014 YES ANSWERED THEO BUT HE DIED YOU KNOW PRISCILLA NODDED THE WEEK BEFORE THEIR WEDDING DAY SHE SAID MISTER OGLETHORPE TOLD ME SO THEO ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AGAIN AND POOR PAM COULD NOT FORGET HIM SHE ADDED
4160-11550-0015 NO SHE REPLIED ALMOST TIMIDLY PAMELA IS FAIRER THAN I AM AND NOT SO TALL WE ARE NOT ALIKE AT ALL I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT SAID PRISCILLA I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE ALIKE IN DISPOSITION I THINK I WAS WONDERING MOST WHETHER YOU WOULD BE AS FAITHFUL AS PAMELA
4160-11550-0016 I REMEMBER HEARING MISTER OGLETHORPE SAY ONCE YOU WOULD BE THEO DROPPED HER IVORY CROCHET NEEDLE AND BENT TO PICK IT UP WITH A BLURRED VISION AND NERVOUS FINGERS I CANNOT TELL SHE SAID
4160-11550-0017 YOU ARE SEVENTEEN SAID PRISCILLA I KNEW AT SEVENTEEN THEO RECOVERED THE NEEDLE AND RESET IT IN HER WORK TO GIVE HERSELF TIME AND THEN SHE LOOKED UP AND FACED HER QUESTIONER BRAVELY IN A SORT OF DESPERATENESS IF I KNEW THAT I LOVED ANY ONE
4160-11550-0018 IF I HAD EVER LOVED ANY ONE AS PAMELA LOVED MISTER BRUNWALDE I SHOULD BE LIKE PAMELA SHE SAID I SHOULD NEVER LOVE ANY ONE ELSE FROM THAT TIME SHE FANCIED THAT PRISCILLA GOWER LIKED HER BETTER THAN SHE HAD DONE BEFORE AT ANY RATE SHE TOOK MORE NOTICE OF HER THOUGH SHE WAS NEVER EFFUSIVE OF COURSE
4160-11550-0019 SHE TALKED TO HER OFTENER AND SEEMED TO LISTEN WHILE SHE TALKED EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS BUSY AT THE TIME SHE SAID TO HER ONCE THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW PAMELA AND EMBOLDENED BY THIS THEO VENTURED TO BRING ONE OF PAM'S LETTERS TO READ TO HER
4160-11550-0020 AND WHEN SHE HAD READ IT TOLD THE WHOLE STORY OF HER SISTER'S GENEROSITY IN A LITTLE BURST OF ENTHUSIASTIC LOVE AND GRATITUDE
4160-11550-0021 THAT FAIRLY MELTED TENDER HEARTED OLD MISS ELIZABETH TO TEARS AND CAUSED HER TO CONFIDE AFTERWARD TO THEO THE FACT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE TENDER PASSION IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A SINGLE GENTLEMAN OF UNCERTAIN AGE
4160-11550-0022 WHOSE PERFORMANCES UPON THE FLUTE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF WINNING HER AFFECTIONS BUT HAD UNHAPPILY RESULTED IN HIS CONTRACTING A FATAL COLD WHILE SERENADING ON A DAMP EVENING HE USED TO PLAY IN A COTTAGE NEAR A WOOD MY DEAR MOST BEAUTIFULLY SAID MISS ELIZABETH WILD WITH PATHOS
4160-11550-0023 THOUGH I REGRET TO SAY THAT AS WE DID NOT LIVE IN A MUSICAL NEIGHBORHOOD THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR DID NOT APPRECIATE IT THE GENTLEMAN OF THE HOUSE EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY WHEN HE DIED AS HE DID A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE COLD SETTLED ON HIS DEAR WEAK LUNGS
4160-11550-0024 HE WAS THE ONLY LOVER I EVER HAD MY DEAR THEODORA AND HIS NAME WAS ELDERBERRY A VERY SINGULAR NAME BY THE WAY BUT HE WAS A VERY TALENTED MAN WHEN THEO WENT INTO THE LITTLE BACK BEDROOM THAT EVENING TO PUT ON HER HAT PRISCILLA GOWER WENT WITH HER
4160-11550-0025 AND AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE DRESSING TABLE BUTTONING HER SACQUE SHE WAS SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY THE EXPRESSION ON HER COMPANION'S FACE PRISCILLA HAD TAKEN UP HER MUFF AND WAS STROKING THE WHITE FUR HER EYES DOWNCAST UPON HER HAND AS IT MOVED TO AND FRO THE RING UPON ITS FOREFINGER SHINING IN THE GASLIGHT
4160-11550-0026 I HAD A LETTER FROM MISTER OGLETHORPE YESTERDAY PRISCILLA SAID AT LAST HE IS IN VIENNA NOW HE ASKED IF YOU WERE WELL TO NIGHT I SHALL ANSWER HIM HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE TO SEND I SAID THEO IT SEEMED TO HER SO STRANGE A THING FOR MISS PRISCILLA GOWER TO SAY
4160-11550-0027 THAT HER PRONOUN WAS ALMOST AN INTERJECTION I THOUGHT PERHAPS SAID PRISCILLA QUIETLY THAT A MESSAGE FROM YOU WOULD GRATIFY HIM IF YOU HAD ONE TO SEND THEO TOOK UP HER GLOVES AND BEGAN TO DRAW THEM ON A SUDDEN FEELING OF PAIN OR DISCOMFORT STRIKING HER
4160-11550-0028 IT WAS A FEELING SCARCELY DEFINED ENOUGH TO ALLOW HER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WAS REAL PAIN OR ONLY DISCOMFORT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE ANY MESSAGE TO SEND SHE REPLIED THANK YOU MISS PRISCILLA SHE TOOK HER MUFF THEN
4160-11550-0029 AND WENT BACK TO THE PARLOR TO KISS MISS ELIZABETH IN A STRANGE FRAME OF MIND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE STRANGELY CONCERNING MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE AND IT WAS PRISCILLA GOWER WHO HAD STIRRED HER HEART SHE FOUND LADY THROCKMORTON WAITING AT HOME FOR HER TO HER SURPRISE IN A NEW MOOD
4160-11550-0030 SHE HAD THAT EVENING RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DENIS HERSELF AND IT HAD SUGGESTED AN IDEA TO HER I HAVE BEEN THINKING THEO SHE SAID THAT WE MIGHT TAKE A RUN OVER THE CHANNEL OURSELVES I HAVE NOT BEEN IN PARIS FOR FOUR YEARS AND I BELIEVE THE CHANGE WOULD DO ME GOOD
4160-11550-0031 THE LAST TIME I VISITED THE SPAS MY HEALTH IMPROVED GREATLY IT WAS JUST LIKE HER LADYSHIP TO BECOME SUDDENLY POSSESSED OF A WHIM AND TO FOLLOW ITS LEAD ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CAPRICES AND HER CAPRICES ALWAYS RULED THE DAY AS THIS ONE DID TO THEO'S GREAT ASTONISHMENT
4160-11550-0032 IT SEEMED SUCH A GREAT UNDERTAKING TO THEODORA THIS VOYAGE OF A FEW HOURS BUT LADY THROCKMORTON REGARDED IT AS THE LIGHTEST OF MATTERS TO HER IT WAS ONLY THE GIVING OF A FEW ORDERS BEING UNCOMFORTABLY SEA SICK FOR A WHILE AND THEN LANDING IN CALAIS
4160-11550-0033 SO WHEN THEO BROKE INTO EXCLAMATIONS OF PLEASURE AND ASTONISHMENT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER HER ENTHUSIASM OR HER SURPRISE WHAT SHE SAID YOU LIKE THE IDEA DO YOU
4160-11550-0034 WELL I THINK I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT WE COULD GO NEXT WEEK AND I DARE SAY WE COULD REACH VIENNA BEFORE DENIS OGLETHORPE GOES AWAY THEO BECAME SUDDENLY SILENT SHE GAVE VENT TO NO FURTHER EXCLAMATIONS SHE WOULD ALMOST HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GIVE UP THE PLEASURE OF THE JOURNEY AFTER THAT
4160-11550-0035 SHE WAS LEARNING THAT IT WAS BEST FOR HER NOT TO SEE DENIS OGLETHORPE AGAIN AND HERE IT SEEMED THAT SHE MUST SEE HIM IN SPITE OF HERSELF EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS CONSCIENTIOUS ENOUGH TO WISH TO DO WHAT WAS BEST NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS BEST FOR HERSELF AS BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TO PRISCILLA GOWER
4160-11550-0036 SHE WAS ACTUALLY GIRLISH AND SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO FANCY THAT MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE MIGHT IMAGINE THEIR INTENTION TO FOLLOW HIM WAS SOME FAULT OF HERS AND SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND NERVOUS ACCORDINGLY SHE HOPED HE WOULD HAVE LEFT VIENNA BEFORE THE LETTER REACHED HIM SHE HOPED HE MIGHT GO AWAY IN SPITE OF IT
4160-11550-0037 SHE HOPED IT MIGHT NEVER REACH HIM AT ALL AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS SHE EXPERIENCED AN ALMOST PASSIONATELY KEEN SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN ON THE DAY BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE LADY THROCKMORTON RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM REGRETTING HIS INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUEST
4160-11550-0038 AND ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE FOR SOME PLACE WHOSE NAME HE DID NOT MENTION BUSINESS HAD CALLED HIM AWAY AND LADY THROCKMORTON OF COURSE KNEW WHAT SUCH BUSINESS WAS AND HOW IMPERATIVE ITS DEMANDS WERE HE MIGHT HAVE WAITED THEO SAID TO HERSELF
4160-11550-0039 WITH AN UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENT FEELING OF WRETCHEDNESS I WOULD HAVE STAYED ANYWHERE TO HAVE SEEN HIM ONLY FOR A MINUTE HE HAD NO NEED TO BE SO READY TO GO AWAY
4160-14187-0000 I WAS BURNING WITH IMPATIENCE TO IMPART MY NEWS TO HIM AND THIS FACT TOGETHER WITH THE GHOSTLY PROCEEDINGS OF POLTON WORKED ME UP TO A STATE OF NERVOUS TENSION THAT RENDERED EITHER REST OR THOUGHT EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE LAMP BELOW GLARING REDLY THROUGH THE FOG
4160-14187-0001 AT THIS MOMENT POLTON MADE A SILENT APPEARANCE ON THE STAIRS LEADING FROM THE LABORATORY GIVING ME QUITE A START AND I WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE INTO THE ROOM WHEN MY EAR CAUGHT THE TINKLE OF A HANSOM APPROACHING FROM PAPER BUILDINGS
4160-14187-0002 THE VEHICLE DREW NEARER AND AT LENGTH STOPPED OPPOSITE THE HOUSE ON WHICH POLTON SLID DOWN THE STAIRS WITH THE AGILITY OF A HARLEQUIN A FEW MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HIS VOICE ASCENDING FROM THE HALL I DO HOPE SIR YOU'RE NOT MUCH HURT
4160-14187-0003 THOUGH VERY DISREPUTABLE TO LOOK AT JUST CAME A CROPPER IN THE MUD JERVIS HE ADDED AS HE NOTED MY DISMAYED EXPRESSION DINNER AND A CLOTHES BRUSH ARE WHAT I CHIEFLY NEED NEVERTHELESS HE LOOKED VERY PALE AND SHAKEN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE LIGHT ON THE LANDING
4160-14187-0004 AND HE SANK INTO HIS EASY CHAIR IN THE LIMP MANNER OF A MAN EITHER VERY WEAK OR VERY FATIGUED HOW DID IT HAPPEN I ASKED WHEN POLTON HAD CREPT AWAY ON TIP TOE TO MAKE READY FOR DINNER THORNDYKE LOOKED ROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS HENCHMAN HAD DEPARTED AND SAID
4160-14187-0005 A QUEER AFFAIR JERVIS A VERY ODD AFFAIR INDEED I WAS COMING UP FROM THE BOROUGH PICKING MY WAY MIGHTY CAREFULLY ACROSS THE ROAD ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREASY SLIPPERY MUD AND HAD JUST REACHED THE FOOT OF LONDON BRIDGE WHEN I HEARD A HEAVY LORRY COMING DOWN THE SLOPE A GOOD DEAL TOO FAST
4160-14187-0006 THE HORSES CAME STAMPING AND SLIDING STRAIGHT ON TO ME AND BEFORE I COULD WRIGGLE OUT OF THE WAY THE HOOF OF ONE OF THEM SMASHED IN MY HAT THAT WAS A NEW ONE THAT I CAME HOME IN AND HALF STUNNED ME THEN THE NEAR WHEEL STRUCK MY HEAD MAKING A DIRTY LITTLE SCALP WOUND AND PINNED DOWN MY SLEEVE SO THAT I COULDN'T PULL AWAY MY ARM
4160-14187-0007 YES I WENT INTO DRY DOCK IN THE O P ROOM AND THEN OLD LANGDALE INSISTED ON MY LYING DOWN FOR AN HOUR OR SO IN CASE ANY SYMPTOMS OF CONCUSSION SHOULD APPEAR BUT I WAS ONLY A TRIFLE SHAKEN AND CONFUSED STILL IT WAS A QUEER AFFAIR YOU MEAN THE MAN PUSHING YOU DOWN IN THAT WAY
4160-14187-0008 YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS INTENTIONAL SURELY I SAID NO OF COURSE NOT HE REPLIED BUT WITHOUT MUCH CONVICTION AS IT SEEMED TO ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO PURSUE THE MATTER WHEN POLTON REAPPEARED AND MY FRIEND ABRUPTLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT AFTER DINNER I RECOUNTED MY CONVERSATION WITH WALTER HORNBY
4160-14187-0009 WATCHING MY COLLEAGUE'S FACE WITH SOME EAGERNESS TO SEE WHAT EFFECT THIS NEW INFORMATION WOULD PRODUCE ON HIM THE RESULT WAS ON THE WHOLE DISAPPOINTING HE WAS INTERESTED KEENLY INTERESTED BUT SHOWED NO SYMPTOMS OF EXCITEMENT
4160-14187-0010 SO JOHN HORNBY HAS BEEN PLUNGING IN MINES EH HE SAID WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER AT HIS AGE DID YOU LEARN HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN IN DIFFICULTIES NO BUT IT CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN QUITE SUDDEN AND UNFORESEEN I SHOULD THINK NOT THORNDYKE AGREED
4160-14187-0011 IN WHICH CASE THE DEPRECIATION WOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED HIM IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT MIGHT HAVE A CONSIDERABLE BEARING ON THE PRESENT CASE MIGHT IT NOT UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THORNDYKE IT MIGHT BEAR ON THE CASE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
4160-14187-0012 THAT IS WELL CONSIDERED SAID MY COLLEAGUE BUT WHAT IS THE SPECIAL BEARING ON THE CASE SUPPOSING IT WAS SO ON THE SUPPOSITION I REPLIED THAT MISTER HORNBY WAS IN ACTUAL PECUNIARY DIFFICULTIES AT THE DATE OF THE ROBBERY IT SEEMS TO ME POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A HYPOTHESIS
4160-14187-0013 IN FACT IT IS ALMOST FANTASTIC NEVER MIND THAT SAID HE A SOUND THINKER GIVES EQUAL CONSIDERATION TO THE PROBABLE AND THE IMPROBABLE THUS ENCOURAGED I PROCEEDED TO SET FORTH THE THEORY OF THE CRIME AS IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME ON MY WAY HOME IN THE FOG
4160-14187-0014 AND I WAS GRATIFIED TO OBSERVE THE CLOSE ATTENTION WITH WHICH THORNDYKE LISTENED AND HIS LITTLE NODS OF APPROVAL AT EACH POINT THAT I MADE WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME TIME LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY INTO THE FIRE AND EVIDENTLY CONSIDERING HOW MY THEORY AND THE NEW FACTS ON WHICH IT WAS BASED
4160-14187-0015 REALLY ADDS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE DULLEST MIND CAN PERCEIVE THE OBVIOUS AS FOR INSTANCE THE IMPORTANCE OF A FINGER PRINT YOU HAVE REALLY DONE A GREAT THING AND I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOU HAVE EMANCIPATED YOURSELF AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT
4160-14187-0016 FROM THE GREAT FINGER PRINT OBSESSION WHICH HAS POSSESSED THE LEGAL MIND EVER SINCE GALTON PUBLISHED HIS EPOCH MAKING MONOGRAPH IN THAT WORK I REMEMBER HE STATES THAT A FINGER PRINT AFFORDS EVIDENCE REQUIRING NO CORROBORATION A MOST DANGEROUS AND MISLEADING STATEMENT
4160-14187-0017 WHICH HAS BEEN FASTENED UPON EAGERLY BY THE POLICE WHO HAVE NATURALLY BEEN DELIGHTED AT OBTAINING A SORT OF MAGIC TOUCHSTONE BY WHICH THEY ARE SAVED THE LABOUR OF INVESTIGATION BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SINGLE FACT THAT AFFORDS EVIDENCE REQUIRING NO CORROBORATION
4160-14187-0018 AS WELL MIGHT ONE EXPECT TO MAKE A SYLLOGISM WITH A SINGLE PREMISE I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD HARDLY GO SO FAR AS THAT I SAID LAUGHING NO HE ADMITTED BUT THE KIND OF SYLLOGISM THAT THEY DO MAKE IS THIS THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS FINGER PRINT
4160-14187-0019 WAS THE CRIME COMMITTED BY THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS FINGER PRINT THAT IS WHERE THE CORROBORATION IS REQUIRED THAT PRACTICALLY LEAVES THE CASE TO BE INVESTIGATED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE FINGER PRINT WHICH THUS BECOMES OF NO IMPORTANCE NOT AT ALL REJOINED THORNDYKE
4160-14187-0020 THE FINGER PRINT IS A MOST VALUABLE CLUE AS LONG AS ITS EVIDENTIAL VALUE IS NOT EXAGGERATED TAKE OUR PRESENT CASE FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT THE THUMB PRINT THE ROBBERY MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY ANYBODY THERE IS NO CLUE WHATEVER
4160-14187-0021 QUITE REPLIED THORNDYKE I HAVE ENTERTAINED IT FROM THE FIRST AND THE NEW FACTS THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED INCREASE ITS PROBABILITY YOU REMEMBER I SAID THAT FOUR HYPOTHESES WERE POSSIBLE THAT THE ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED EITHER BY REUBEN BY WALTER BY JOHN HORNBY OR BY SOME OTHER PERSON
4160-14187-0022 NOW PUTTING ASIDE THE SOME OTHER PERSON FOR CONSIDERATION ONLY IF THE FIRST THREE HYPOTHESES FAIL WE HAVE LEFT REUBEN WALTER AND JOHN BUT IF WE LEAVE THE THUMB PRINT OUT OF THE QUESTION THE PROBABILITIES EVIDENTLY POINT TO JOHN HORNBY
4160-14187-0023 SINCE HE ADMITTEDLY HAD ACCESS TO THE DIAMONDS WHEREAS THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT THE OTHERS HAD THE THUMB PRINT HOWEVER TRANSFERS THE SUSPICION TO REUBEN BUT YET AS YOUR THEORY MAKES EVIDENT IT DOES NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR JOHN HORNBY
4160-14187-0024 AS THE CASE STANDS THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES MAY BE STATED THUS JOHN HORNBY UNDOUBTEDLY HAD ACCESS TO THE DIAMONDS AND THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE STOLEN THEM BUT IF THE THUMB MARK WAS MADE AFTER HE CLOSED THE SAFE AND BEFORE HE OPENED IT AGAIN
4160-14187-0025 BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ACCESS TO THEM AND IF HE HAD NOT HE COULD NOT HAVE MADE THE THUMB MARK IN THE MANNER AND AT THE TIME STATED BUT JOHN HORNBY MAY HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE PREVIOUSLY MADE THUMB MARK OF REUBEN AND MAY POSSIBLY HAVE OBTAINED IT IN WHICH CASE HE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE THIEF
4160-14187-0026 AS TO WALTER HORNBY HE MAY HAVE HAD THE MEANS OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ACCESS EITHER TO THE DIAMONDS OR TO MISTER HORNBY'S MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4160-14187-0027 THE ACTUAL POINTS AT ISSUE THEN I SAID ARE WHETHER REUBEN HAD ANY MEANS OF OPENING THE SAFE AND WHETHER MISTER HORNBY EVER DID ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK IN BLOOD ON HIS MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4160-14187-0028 YES REPLIED THORNDYKE THOSE ARE THE POINTS WITH SOME OTHERS AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN UNSETTLED REUBEN'S ROOMS HAVE BEEN SEARCHED BY THE POLICE WHO FAILED TO FIND ANY SKELETON OR DUPLICATE KEYS BUT THIS PROVES NOTHING AS HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MADE AWAY WITH THEM WHEN HE HEARD OF THE THUMB MARK BEING FOUND
1034-121119-0000 CHAPTER NINETY NINE THE LAW WE HAVE SEEN HOW QUIETLY
1034-121119-0001 THE FACT BEING THAT EVERY ONE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN HIS OR HER OWN AFFAIRS TO THINK OF THEIRS WE WILL LEAVE THE BANKER CONTEMPLATING THE ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE OF HIS DEBT BEFORE THE PHANTOM OF BANKRUPTCY AND FOLLOW THE BARONESS
1034-121119-0002 WHO AFTER BEING MOMENTARILY CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOW WHICH HAD STRUCK HER HAD GONE TO SEEK HER USUAL ADVISER LUCIEN DEBRAY THE BARONESS HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MARRIAGE AS A MEANS OF RIDDING HER OF A GUARDIANSHIP WHICH OVER A GIRL OF EUGENIE'S CHARACTER
1034-121119-0003 FOR IN THE TACIT RELATIONS WHICH MAINTAIN THE BOND OF FAMILY UNION THE MOTHER TO MAINTAIN HER ASCENDANCY OVER HER DAUGHTER MUST NEVER FAIL TO BE A MODEL OF WISDOM AND A TYPE OF PERFECTION NOW
1034-121119-0004 AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL HER MOTHER'S AMOROUS AND PECUNIARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE INTIMATE SECRETARY MOREOVER
1034-121119-0005 NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS A SOURCE OF DISSENSION AND SCANDAL UNDER THE PATERNAL ROOF BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD AT ONCE CLASSED HIM IN THAT CATALOGUE OF BIPEDS WHOM PLATO ENDEAVORS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE APPELLATION OF MEN
1034-121119-0006 UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS WORLD OF OURS EACH PERSON VIEWS THINGS THROUGH A CERTAIN MEDIUM AND SO IS PREVENTED FROM SEEING IN THE SAME LIGHT AS OTHERS AND MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE VERY MUCH REGRETTED THAT THE MARRIAGE OF EUGENIE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE
1034-121119-0007 NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE MATCH WAS GOOD AND LIKELY TO INSURE THE HAPPINESS OF HER CHILD BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO SET HER AT LIBERTY SHE RAN THEREFORE TO DEBRAY WHO AFTER HAVING LIKE THE REST OF PARIS WITNESSED THE CONTRACT SCENE AND THE SCANDAL ATTENDING IT
1034-121119-0008 HAD RETIRED IN HASTE TO HIS CLUB WHERE HE WAS CHATTING WITH SOME FRIENDS UPON THE EVENTS WHICH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FOR THREE FOURTHS OF THAT CITY KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN MADAME DANGLARS DRESSED IN BLACK AND CONCEALED IN A LONG VEIL
1034-121119-0009 WAS ASCENDING THE STAIRS LEADING TO DEBRAY'S APARTMENTS
1034-121119-0010 DEBRAY WAS OCCUPIED IN REPELLING THE INSINUATIONS OF A FRIEND WHO TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM
1034-121119-0011 STILL WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE INDEPENDENT PROUD SPIRIT OF EUGENIE HE POSITIVELY REJECTED IT AS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH THE SAME THOUGHT AGAIN CONTINUALLY RECURRED AND FOUND A RESTING PLACE IN HIS HEART TEA PLAY
1034-121119-0012 AND THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BECOME INTERESTING DURING THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH SERIOUS AFFAIRS
1034-121119-0013 AWAITED THE RETURN OF DEBRAY IN THE LITTLE GREEN ROOM SEATED BETWEEN TWO BASKETS OF FLOWERS WHICH SHE HAD THAT MORNING SENT AND WHICH IT MUST BE CONFESSED
1034-121119-0014 WITH SO MUCH CARE THAT HIS ABSENCE WAS HALF EXCUSED IN THE EYES OF THE POOR WOMAN AT TWENTY MINUTES OF TWELVE MADAME DANGLARS TIRED OF WAITING RETURNED HOME WOMEN OF A CERTAIN GRADE ARE LIKE PROSPEROUS GRISETTES IN ONE RESPECT THEY SELDOM RETURN HOME AFTER TWELVE O'CLOCK
1034-121119-0015 THE BARONESS RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS EUGENIE USED IN LEAVING IT SHE RAN LIGHTLY UP STAIRS AND WITH AN ACHING HEART ENTERED HER APARTMENT CONTIGUOUS AS WE KNOW TO THAT OF EUGENIE SHE WAS FEARFUL OF EXCITING ANY REMARK
1034-121119-0016 AND BELIEVED FIRMLY IN HER DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE AND FIDELITY TO THE PATERNAL ROOF SHE LISTENED AT EUGENIE'S DOOR AND HEARING NO SOUND TRIED TO ENTER BUT THE BOLTS WERE IN PLACE MADAME DANGLARS THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN OVERCOME WITH THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
1034-121119-0017 AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID
1034-121119-0018 AFTER WHICH THEY DESIRED ME TO LEAVE SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED ME NO LONGER
1034-121119-0019 MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE WENT TO BED WITHOUT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION AND BEGAN TO MUSE OVER THE RECENT EVENTS IN PROPORTION AS HER MEMORY BECAME CLEARER THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING WERE REVEALED IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT WHAT SHE HAD TAKEN FOR CONFUSION WAS A TUMULT
1034-121119-0020 WHO HAD BEEN AFFLICTED WITH AS SEVERE A BLOW THROUGH HER HUSBAND AND SON EUGENIE SHE SAID TO HERSELF IS LOST AND SO ARE WE THE AFFAIR AS IT WILL BE REPORTED WILL COVER US WITH SHAME
1034-121119-0021 FOR IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS SATIRE INFLICTS A PAINFUL AND INCURABLE WOUND
1034-121119-0022 AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
1034-121119-0023 AND OUT OF A FAULT NAY EVEN A VICE SOMETIMES PRODUCES A BLESSING AND THEN HER THOUGHTS CLEAVING THROUGH SPACE LIKE A BIRD IN THE AIR RESTED ON CAVALCANTI THIS ANDREA WAS A WRETCH A ROBBER AN ASSASSIN
1034-121119-0024 AND YET HIS MANNERS SHOWED THE EFFECTS OF A SORT OF EDUCATION IF NOT A COMPLETE ONE
1034-121119-0025 SUPPORTED BY AN HONORABLE NAME HOW COULD SHE EXTRICATE HERSELF FROM THIS LABYRINTH TO WHOM WOULD SHE APPLY TO HELP HER OUT OF THIS PAINFUL SITUATION DEBRAY TO WHOM SHE HAD RUN WITH THE FIRST INSTINCT OF A WOMAN TOWARDS THE MAN SHE LOVES AND WHO YET BETRAYS HER
1034-121119-0026 DEBRAY COULD BUT GIVE HER ADVICE SHE MUST APPLY TO SOME ONE MORE POWERFUL THAN HE
1034-121119-0027 BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
1034-121119-0028 IT WAS NOT THE EXECUTIONER BUT THE SURGEON WHO WISHED TO WITHDRAW THE HONOR OF DANGLARS FROM IGNOMINIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISGRACED YOUNG MAN THEY HAD PRESENTED TO THE WORLD AS THEIR SON IN LAW AND SINCE VILLEFORT THE FRIEND OF DANGLARS HAD ACTED IN THIS WAY
1034-121119-0029 NO ONE COULD SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH OR HAD LENT HIMSELF TO ANY OF ANDREA'S INTRIGUES
1034-121119-0030 APPEARED TO THE BARONESS AS IF SHAPED FOR THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE BUT THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE PROCUREUR SHOULD STOP THERE SHE WOULD SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND IF SHE COULD NOT MAKE HIM FAIL IN HIS DUTIES AS A MAGISTRATE SHE WOULD AT LEAST
1034-121119-0031 OBTAIN ALL THE INDULGENCE HE COULD ALLOW SHE WOULD INVOKE THE PAST RECALL OLD RECOLLECTIONS SHE WOULD SUPPLICATE HIM BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF GUILTY YET HAPPY DAYS
1034-121119-0032 HE HAD ONLY TO TURN HIS EYES ON ONE SIDE AND ALLOW ANDREA TO FLY AND FOLLOW UP THE CRIME UNDER THAT SHADOW OF GUILT CALLED CONTEMPT OF COURT AND AFTER THIS REASONING SHE SLEPT EASILY
1034-121119-0033 AT NINE O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING SHE AROSE AND WITHOUT RINGING FOR HER MAID OR GIVING THE LEAST SIGN OF HER ACTIVITY SHE DRESSED HERSELF IN THE SAME SIMPLE STYLE AS ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT THEN RUNNING DOWN STAIRS SHE LEFT THE HOTEL WALKED TO THE RUE DE PROVENCE
1034-121119-0034 FOR THE LAST MONTH THIS WRETCHED HOUSE HAD PRESENTED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF A LAZARETTO INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE SOME OF THE APARTMENTS WERE CLOSED WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE SHUTTERS WERE ONLY OPENED TO ADMIT A MINUTE'S AIR SHOWING THE SCARED FACE OF A FOOTMAN
1034-121119-0035 AND THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
1034-121119-0036 MADAME DANGLARS INVOLUNTARILY SHUDDERED AT THE DESOLATE ASPECT OF THE MANSION
1034-121119-0037 THREE TIMES DID THE BELL RING WITH A DULL HEAVY SOUND SEEMING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GENERAL SADNESS BEFORE THE CONCIERGE APPEARED AND PEEPED THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIS WORDS TO BE HEARD

1034-121119-0045 DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DOOR WAS OPENED WIDE ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER AND WHEN SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH IT WAS AGAIN SHUT WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF HER FOR AN INSTANT THE CONCIERGE TOOK A WHISTLE FROM HIS POCKET AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE COURT AND BLEW IT
1034-121119-0046 YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS POOR FELLOW MADAME
1034-121119-0047 IN THE COURT SHOWING HIS MERCHANDISE WAS A TRADESMAN WHO HAD BEEN ADMITTED WITH THE SAME PRECAUTIONS THE BARONESS ASCENDED THE STEPS SHE FELT HERSELF STRONGLY INFECTED WITH THE SADNESS WHICH SEEMED TO MAGNIFY HER OWN
1034-121119-0048 PREOCCUPIED AS MADAME DANGLARS HAD BEEN WITH THE OBJECT OF HER VISIT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM THESE UNDERLINGS APPEARED TO HER SO INSULTING THAT SHE BEGAN BY COMPLAINING OF IT
1034-121119-0049 RAISING HIS HEAD BOWED DOWN BY GRIEF LOOKED UP AT HER WITH SO SAD A SMILE THAT HER COMPLAINTS DIED UPON HER LIPS FORGIVE MY SERVANTS HE SAID FOR A TERROR I CANNOT BLAME THEM FOR FROM BEING SUSPECTED THEY HAVE BECOME SUSPICIOUS

1034-121119-0051 YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO ME ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS JUST HAPPENED YES SIR A FEARFUL MISFORTUNE YOU MEAN A MISCHANCE A MISCHANCE REPEATED THE BARONESS ALAS MADAME
1034-121119-0052 SAID THE PROCUREUR WITH HIS IMPERTURBABLE CALMNESS OF MANNER I CONSIDER THOSE ALONE MISFORTUNES WHICH ARE IRREPARABLE AND DO YOU SUPPOSE THIS WILL BE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING WILL BE FORGOTTEN MADAME SAID VILLEFORT
1034-121119-0053 YOUR DAUGHTER WILL BE MARRIED TO MORROW IF NOT TO DAY IN A WEEK IF NOT TO MORROW AND I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN REGRET THE INTENDED HUSBAND OF YOUR DAUGHTER MADAME DANGLARS GAZED ON VILLEFORT STUPEFIED TO FIND HIM SO ALMOST INSULTINGLY CALM
1034-121119-0054 AM I COME TO A FRIEND SHE ASKED IN A TONE FULL OF MOURNFUL DIGNITY
1034-121119-0055 SAID VILLEFORT WHOSE PALE CHEEKS BECAME SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AS HE GAVE HER THE ASSURANCE AND TRULY THIS ASSURANCE CARRIED HIM BACK TO DIFFERENT EVENTS FROM THOSE NOW OCCUPYING THE BARONESS AND HIM WELL THEN BE MORE AFFECTIONATE MY DEAR VILLEFORT
1034-121119-0056 SAID THE BARONESS SPEAK TO ME NOT AS A MAGISTRATE BUT AS A FRIEND AND WHEN I AM IN BITTER ANGUISH OF SPIRIT DO NOT TELL ME THAT I OUGHT TO BE GAY VILLEFORT BOWED WHEN I HEAR MISFORTUNES NAMED MADAME
1034-121119-0057 HE SAID I HAVE WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS CONTRACTED THE BAD HABIT OF THINKING OF MY OWN AND THEN I CANNOT HELP DRAWING UP AN EGOTISTICAL PARALLEL IN MY MIND THAT IS THE REASON THAT BY THE SIDE OF MY MISFORTUNES
1034-121119-0058 BUT THIS ANNOYS YOU LET US CHANGE THE SUBJECT YOU WERE SAYING MADAME I CAME TO ASK YOU MY FRIEND SAID THE BARONESS WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH THIS IMPOSTOR IMPOSTOR

1034-121119-0063 IMPOSSIBLE MADAME JUSTICE HAS ITS FORMALITIES WHAT EVEN FOR ME SAID THE BARONESS HALF JESTING HALF IN EARNEST FOR ALL EVEN FOR MYSELF AMONG THE REST
1034-121119-0064 REPLIED VILLEFORT AH EXCLAIMED THE BARONESS WITHOUT EXPRESSING THE IDEAS WHICH THE EXCLAMATION BETRAYED VILLEFORT LOOKED AT HER WITH THAT PIERCING GLANCE WHICH READS THE SECRETS OF THE HEART
1034-121119-0065 YOU REFER TO THE TERRIBLE RUMORS SPREAD ABROAD IN THE WORLD THAT THE DEATHS WHICH HAVE KEPT ME IN MOURNING FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS
1034-121119-0066 HAVE NOT HAPPENED BY NATURAL MEANS I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT REPLIED MADAME DANGLARS QUICKLY YES YOU WERE THINKING OF IT AND WITH JUSTICE
1034-121119-0067 YOU WHO PURSUE CRIME SO VINDICTIVELY ANSWER NOW
1034-121119-0068 THE BARONESS BECAME PALE YOU WERE SAYING THIS WERE YOU NOT WELL I OWN IT I WILL ANSWER YOU
1034-121119-0069 THEN RESTING BOTH HANDS UPON HIS DESK HE SAID IN A VOICE MORE HOLLOW THAN USUAL THERE ARE CRIMES WHICH REMAIN UNPUNISHED BECAUSE THE CRIMINALS ARE UNKNOWN
1034-121119-0070 VILLEFORT HERE EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARD A LARGE CRUCIFIX PLACED OPPOSITE TO HIS DESK WHEN THEY ARE DISCOVERED I SWEAR TO YOU BY ALL I HOLD MOST SACRED
1034-121119-0071 NOW AFTER THE OATH I HAVE JUST TAKEN AND WHICH I WILL KEEP MADAME DARE YOU ASK FOR MERCY FOR THAT WRETCH BUT SIR ARE YOU SURE HE IS AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY LISTEN
1034-121119-0072 THIS IS HIS DESCRIPTION BENEDETTO CONDEMNED AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN FOR FIVE YEARS TO THE GALLEYS FOR FORGERY HE PROMISED WELL AS YOU SEE FIRST A RUNAWAY THEN AN ASSASSIN
1034-121119-0073 AND WHO IS THIS WRETCH WHO CAN TELL A VAGABOND A CORSICAN HAS NO ONE OWNED HIM NO ONE HIS PARENTS ARE UNKNOWN
1034-121119-0074 BUT WHO WAS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT HIM FROM LUCCA ANOTHER RASCAL LIKE HIMSELF PERHAPS HIS ACCOMPLICE THE BARONESS CLASPED HER HANDS
1034-121119-0075 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MADAME SAID VILLEFORT WITH A FIRMNESS OF EXPRESSION NOT ALTOGETHER FREE FROM HARSHNESS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
1034-121119-0076 WHAT AM I THE LAW HAS THE LAW ANY EYES TO WITNESS YOUR GRIEF
1034-121119-0077 HAS THE LAW A MEMORY FOR ALL THOSE SOFT RECOLLECTIONS YOU ENDEAVOR TO RECALL NO MADAME

1034-121119-0081 WELL BE IT SO LET ME BLUSH FOR THE FAULTS YOU KNOW AND PERHAPS PERHAPS FOR EVEN MORE THAN THOSE BUT HAVING SINNED MYSELF IT MAY BE MORE DEEPLY THAN OTHERS
1034-121119-0082 I NEVER REST TILL I HAVE TORN THE DISGUISES FROM MY FELLOW CREATURES AND FOUND OUT THEIR WEAKNESSES I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM AND MORE I REPEAT IT WITH JOY WITH TRIUMPH I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND SOME PROOF OF HUMAN PERVERSITY OR ERROR
1034-121119-0083 EVERY CRIMINAL I CONDEMN SEEMS TO ME LIVING EVIDENCE THAT I AM NOT A HIDEOUS EXCEPTION TO THE REST ALAS ALAS ALAS ALL THE WORLD IS WICKED LET US THEREFORE STRIKE AT WICKEDNESS
1034-121119-0084 WITH A FEVERISH RAGE WHICH GAVE A FEROCIOUS ELOQUENCE TO HIS WORDS
1034-121119-0085 THIS YOUNG MAN THOUGH A MURDERER IS AN ORPHAN ABANDONED BY EVERYBODY SO MUCH THE WORSE OR RATHER SO MUCH THE BETTER
1034-121119-0086 BUT THIS IS TRAMPLING ON THE WEAK SIR THE WEAKNESS OF A MURDERER HIS DISHONOR REFLECTS UPON US
1034-121119-0087 OH SIR EXCLAIMED THE BARONESS YOU ARE WITHOUT PITY FOR OTHERS WELL THEN I TELL YOU THEY WILL HAVE NO MERCY ON YOU BE IT SO SAID VILLEFORT RAISING HIS ARMS TO HEAVEN AT LEAST
1034-121119-0088 DELAY THE TRIAL TILL THE NEXT ASSIZES
1034-121119-0089 NO MADAME SAID VILLEFORT INSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN GIVEN
1034-121119-0090 FIVE DAYS ARE MORE THAN I REQUIRE
1034-121119-0091 I SOMETIMES LOSE ALL RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST AND THEN I EXPERIENCE THE SAME SORT OF HAPPINESS I CAN IMAGINE THE DEAD FEEL STILL IT IS BETTER THAN SUFFERING BUT SIR HE HAS FLED LET HIM ESCAPE INACTION IS A PARDONABLE OFFENCE
1034-121119-0092 I TELL YOU IT IS TOO LATE EARLY THIS MORNING THE TELEGRAPH WAS EMPLOYED AND AT THIS VERY MINUTE
1034-121119-0093 A DRAGOON HAS BROUGHT THIS DESPATCH FROM THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR
1034-121119-0094 MADAME DANGLARS TREMBLED WITH FEAR VILLEFORT STARTED WITH JOY ARRESTED HE EXCLAIMED HE WAS TAKEN AT COMPIEGNE AND ALL IS OVER
1034-121119-0095 PALE AND COLD ADIEU SIR SHE SAID ADIEU MADAME REPLIED THE KING'S ATTORNEY AS IN AN ALMOST JOYFUL MANNER HE CONDUCTED HER TO THE DOOR
8838-298546-0000 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0002 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0003 MATCHED AGAINST A PUGILIST OVER AT CROXLEY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LAW DOES NOT STEP IN AND STOP SO DEGRADING AN EXHIBITION IT IS REALLY A PRIZE FIGHT A GLOVE FIGHT YOU SAID
8838-298546-0004 I AM INFORMED THAT A TWO OZ GLOVE IS AN EVASION BY WHICH THEY DODGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO INTERFERE
8838-298546-0005 TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
8838-298546-0006 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0007 COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0009 THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0010 THE LITTLE MAN COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE IN HIS ASTONISHMENT WHY SIR HE'S THE FIRST MON O THE DISTRICT AN HIS NAME'S AS WELL KNOWN IN THE WEST RIDING AS THE WINNER O T DERBY BUT LOR SIR HERE HE STOPPED AND RUMMAGED AMONG A HEAP OF PAPERS
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0012 SILAS CRAGGS AND BENEATH THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL ABOUT HIM THERE SIR SAID THE TOBACCONIST HE'S A WITHERIN TYKE HE IS AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM IN THE COUNTY IF HE HADN'T BROKE HIS LEG HE'D HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF ENGLAND
8838-298546-0013 BROKE HIS LEG HAS HE YES AND IT SET BADLY THEY CA HIM OWD K BEHIND HIS BACK FOR THAT IS HOW HIS TWO LEGS LOOK BUT HIS ARMS WELL IF THEY WAS BOTH STROPPED TO A BENCH AS THE SAYIN IS
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0016 AND WON THE PROUD TITLE WHICH HE STILL HOLDS AMBITIOUS OF A MORE THAN LOCAL FAME HE SECURED A PATRON AND FOUGHT HIS FIRST FIGHT AGAINST JACK BARTON OF BIRMINGHAM IN MAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AT THE OLD LOITERERS CLUB CRAGGS
8838-298546-0017 WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
8838-298546-0018 IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
8838-298546-0019 THE MASTER ADAPTED THE STYLE OF HIS FIGHTING TO HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND RESUMED HIS CAREER OF VICTORY DEFEATING NORTON THE BLACK HOBBY WILSON AND LEVI COHEN THE LATTER A HEAVY WEIGHT CONCEDING TWO STONE HE FOUGHT A DRAW WITH THE FAMOUS BILLY MC QUIRE
8838-298546-0020 WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
8838-298546-0021 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0022 NO LIGHT MATTER THIS WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO BATTLE WITH A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHTER WHO PRESUMED UPON A LOCAL REPUTATION THE MAN'S RECORD SHOWED THAT HE WAS FIRST CLASS OR NEARLY SO THERE WERE A FEW POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR AND HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM
8838-298546-0023 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0025 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
8838-298546-0026 MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
8838-298546-0027 BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
8838-298546-0028 WILL TAKE WITHOUT FLINCHING A BLOW WHICH WOULD LEAVE ANOTHER MAN WRITHING ON THE GROUND SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE ACQUIRED IN A WEEK BUT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WEEK SHOULD BE DONE THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT HAD A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0030 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0031 GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
8838-298546-0032 ALL THOT'S BETTER MON THOT'S FINE HE WOULD ADD AS HIS OPPONENT LIFTED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM ON THE END OF A RIGHT COUNTER THOT'S HOW I LIKES TO FEEL EM HAPPEN THOU'LT PULL THROUGH YET HE CHUCKLED WITH JOY WHEN MONTGOMERY KNOCKED HIM INTO A CORNER
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
8838-298546-0034 I SHOULD DO A DOUBLE DAY'S WORK ON FRIDAY SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN ORDER I SHOULD HOPE TO BE BACK IN THE EVENING I AM AFRAID I CANNOT SPARE YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY THIS WAS A FACER IF HE COULD NOT GET LEAVE HE WOULD GO WITHOUT IT
8838-298546-0035 YOU WILL REMEMBER DOCTOR OLDACRE THAT WHEN I CAME TO YOU IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR DAY EVERY MONTH I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY I WISH TO HAVE A HOLIDAY UPON SATURDAY DOCTOR OLDACRE GAVE IN WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0037 A QUIET RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE AS HE CLAIMED HIS SATURDAY WHICH AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NO DESIRE TO INTERFERE UNDULY WITH YOUR AFFAIRS MISTER MONTGOMERY BUT WERE YOU THINKING OF HAVING A DAY IN LEEDS UPON SATURDAY NO SIR
8838-298546-0038 IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
8838-298546-0039 A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
8838-298546-0040 YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF MOLESTED BY THE BLACKGUARDS WHOM IT WILL ATTRACT I WILL TAKE MY CHANCE OF THAT SIR SAID THE ASSISTANT ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE FIGHT
8838-298546-0041 HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE
8838-298546-0042 THAT'S ONLY THREE PUND OFF IN A WEEK'S TRAININ SAID THE HORSE BREAKER HE SAID RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN CONDITION WELL IT'S FINE STUFF ALL THERE IS OF IT BUT I'M NONE SO SURE AS THERE IS ENOUGH
8838-298546-0043 HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
8838-298546-0044 I HEAR THEY'VE HAD A RARE JOB TO GET HIM TO DROP HIS BEER AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT GREAT RED HEADED WENCH OF HIS
8838-298546-0045 SHE FAIR SCRATTED THE FACE OFF A POTMAN THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM A GALLON FROM T CHEQUERS THEY SAY THE HUSSY IS HIS SPARRIN PARTNER AS WELL AS HIS SWEETHEART AND THAT HIS POOR WIFE IS JUST BREAKIN HER HEART OVER IT HULLO YOUNG UN WHAT DO YOU WANT
8838-298546-0046 THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR

8465-246942-0000 SHE HAD SOUGHT THE DOOR OF PARADISE AND THE DOOR OF HELL HAD BEEN OPENED TO HER IF THE FRIGHTFUL IDEA WHICH SHE DID NOT DOUBT HAD ALREADY SUGGESTED ITSELF TO LEOPOLD SHOULD NOW BE ENCOURAGED THERE WAS NOTHING BUT BLACK MADNESS BEFORE HER
8465-246942-0001 HER POLDIE ON THE SCAFFOLD GOD IN HEAVEN INFINITELY RATHER WOULD SHE POISON HERSELF AND HIM THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW PLEASED AND CONSOLED HE HAD BEEN WHEN SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR DYING TOGETHER AND THAT REASSURED HER A LITTLE
8465-246942-0002 BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
8465-246942-0003 HELEN'S ONLY KNOWLEDGE OF GUILT CAME FROM THE PALE IMAGE OF IT LIFTED ABOVE HER HORIZON BY THE REFRACTION OF HER SYMPATHY SHE DID NOT KNOW PERHAPS NEVER WOULD UNDERSTAND THE GHASTLY HORROR OF CONSCIOUS GUILT BESIDES WHICH THERE IS NO EVIL ELSE
8465-246942-0004 AGONIES OF INJURY A MAN MAY ENDURE AND SO FAR FROM BEING OVERWHELMED RISE ABOVE THEM TENFOLD A MAN WHO WERE HE TO AWAKE TO THE SELF KNOWLEDGE OF A CRIME WOULD SINK INTO A HEAP OF RUIN
8465-246942-0005 THEN INDEED IF THERE BE NO GOD OR ONE THAT HAS NOT AN INFINITE POWER OF SETTING RIGHT THAT WHICH HAS GONE WRONG WITH HIS WORK THEN INDEED WELCOME THE FAITH FOR FAITH IT MAY THEN BE CALLED OF SUCH AS SAY THERE IS NO HEREAFTER
8465-246942-0006 HELEN DID NOT KNOW TO WHAT GULFS OF PERSONAL SHAME NAY TO WHAT SUMMITS OF PUBLIC EXECRATION A MAN MAY BE GLAD TO FLEE FOR REFUGE FROM THE FANGS OF HOME BORN GUILT IF SO BE THERE IS ANY REFUGE TO BE FOUND IN EITHER
8465-246942-0007 AND SOME KIND OF REFUGE THERE DOES SEEM TO BE STRANGE IT IS AND TRUE THAT IN PUBLICITY ITSELF LIES SOME RELIEF FROM THE GNAWING OF THE WORM AS IF EVEN A CURSING HUMANITY WERE A BARRIER OF PROTECTION BETWEEN THE TORN SOUL AND ITS CRIME
8465-246942-0008 IT FLEES TO ITS KIND FOR SHELTER FROM ITSELF HENCE I IMAGINE IN PART MAY THE COOLNESS OF SOME CRIMINALS BE ACCOUNTED FOR THEIR QUIETNESS IS THE RELIEF BROUGHT BY CONFESSION EVEN CONFESSION BUT TO THEIR FELLOWS
8465-246942-0009 IS IT THAT THE CRIME SEEMS THEN LIFTED A LITTLE FROM THEIR SHOULDERS AND ITS WEIGHT SHARED BY THE ACE HELEN HAD HOPED THAT THE MAN WHO HAD SPOKEN IN PUBLIC SO TENDERLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SO POWERFULLY OF THE SAVING HEART OF THE UNIVERSE
8465-246942-0010 THAT WOULD HAVE NO DIVISIONS OF PRIDE NO SCATTERINGS OF HATE
8465-246942-0011 WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HOME IN GLADNESS TO HER SICK SOULED BROTHER TO COMFORT AND STRENGTHEN HIM
8465-246942-0012 AND MAKE HIM FEEL THAT AFTER ALL THERE WAS YET A PLACE FOR HIM IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT HE WAS NO OUTCAST OF GEHENNA BUT INSTEAD OF SUCH WORDS OF GENTLE MIGHT LIKE THOSE OF THE MAN OF WHOM HE WAS SO FOND OF TALKING
8465-246942-0013 HE HAD ONLY SPOKEN DREARILY OF DUTY HINTING AT A HORROR THAT WOULD PLUNGE THE WHOLE ANCIENT FAMILY INTO A HELL OF DISHONOUR AND CONTEMPT
8465-246942-0014 SKELETONS THEY WERE AND NO HUMAN BEINGS AT ALL HER FATHER
8465-246942-0015 IF LEOPOLD HAD HAD HER MOTHER FOR HIS TOO INSTEAD OF THE DARK SKINNED WOMAN WITH THE FLASHING EYES HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON THEM IT WAS ALL HIS MOTHER'S FAULT THE FAULT OF HER RACE AND OF THE HORRIBLE DRUG HER PEOPLE HAD TAUGHT HIM TO TAKE
8465-246942-0016 AND WAS HE TO GO AND CONFESS IT AND BE TRIED FOR IT AND BE GREAT GOD AND HERE WAS THE PRIEST ACTUALLY COUNSELLING WHAT WAS WORSE THAN ANY SUICIDE
8465-246942-0017 SUDDENLY HOWEVER IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE CURATE HAD HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND HAD THEREFORE BEEN COMPELLED TO TALK AT RANDOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD SUSPECT THE CRIME OF WHICH HER BROTHER HAD BEEN GUILTY
8465-246942-0018 AND THEREFORE COULD NOT KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONFESSION AS HE HAD COUNSELLED HAD SHE NOT BETTER THEN TELL HIM ALL AND SO GATHER FROM HIM SOME RIGHT AND REASONABLE ADVICE FOR THE SOOTHING OF THE AGONIES OF HER POOR BROKEN WINGED ANGEL
8465-246942-0019 BUT ALAS WHAT SECURITY HAD SHE THAT A MAN CAPABLE OF SUCH PRIESTLY SEVEIRITY AND HEARTLESSNESS
8465-246942-0020 NO SHE WOULD VENTURE NO FARTHER SOONER WOULD SHE GO TO GEORGE BASCOMBE FROM WHOM SHE NOT ONLY COULD LOOK FOR NO SPIRITUAL COMFORT BUT WHOSE THEORIES WERE SO CRUEL AGAINST CULPRITS OF ALL SORTS
8465-246942-0021 ALAS ALAS SHE WAS ALONE ABSOLUTELY ALONE IN THE GREAT WASTE DEATH EYED UNIVERSE BUT FOR A MAN TO TALK SO OF THE TENDERNESS OF JESUS CHRIST
8465-246942-0022 AND THEN SERVE HER AS THE CURATE HAD DONE IT WAS INDEED SHAMELESS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TREATED A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN LIKE THAT AND AS SHE SAID THUS TO HERSELF AGAIN THE WORDS SOUNDED IN THE EAR OF HER HEART
8465-246942-0023 COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST WHENCE CAME THE VOICE FROM HER MEMORY OR FROM THAT INNER CHAMBER OF THE SPIRIT WHICH THE ONE SPIRIT BEARING SPIRIT
8465-246942-0024 KEEPS FOR HIS OWN IN EVERY HOUSE THAT HE BUILDS ALAS SO LONG IN MOST HUMAN HOUSES SHUT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE ROOMS AND FORGOTTEN OR RECOLLECTED WITH UNEASINESS AS A LUMBER CLOSET IN WHICH LIE TOO MANY THINGS THAT HAD BETTER NOT BE LOOKED INTO
8465-246942-0025 BUT WHAT MATTER WHERE THE VOICE THAT HAD SAID THEM SO LONG AS THE WORDS WERE TRUE AND SHE MIGHT BELIEVE THEM WHATEVER IS TRUE CAN BE BELIEVED OF THE TRUE HEART ERE SHE KNEW
8465-246942-0026 HELEN WAS ON HER KNEES WITH HER HEAD ON THE CHAIR YET ONCE MORE CRYING TO THE HEARER OF CRIES POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE BEING SHE KNEW NOT IN THE LEAST BUT WORDS REPORTED OF HIM HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THE CRY TO HELP HER IN HER DIRE NEED
8465-246942-0027 INSTEAD OF ANY WORD OR THOUGHT EVEN COMING TO HER THAT MIGHT BE FANCIED AN ANSWER SHE WAS SCARED FROM HER KNEES BY AN APPROACHING STEP
8465-246943-0000 HELEN ROSE AND HASTENED TO HER BROTHER WITH A HEART OF LEAD IN HER BODY SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM SOME CHANGE HAD PASSED ON HIM SINCE THE MORNING
8465-246943-0001 THAT GLIMMER ON HIS COUNTENANCE DOUBTFUL AS THE FIRST OF THE MORNING WHEN THE TRAVELLER KNOWS NOT WHETHER THE LIGHT BE IN THE SKY OR ONLY IN HIS BRAIN
8465-246943-0002 BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE APPEARED MORE WASTED AND PINCHED AND DEATH LIKE THAN SHE HAD YET SEEN HIM OR WAS IT ONLY IN HER EYES WAS SHE BUT READING IN HIS FACE THE AGONY SHE HAD HERSELF GONE THROUGH THAT DAY HELEN HELEN HE CRIED AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
8465-246943-0003 WHAT WAS THAT POLDIE ASKED HELEN WITH A PANG OF FEAR WHY THOSE WORDS OF COURSE WHAT ELSE YOU SANG THEM TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW HELEN
8465-246943-0004 DON'T YOU THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
8465-246943-0005 WAS THIS WHAT CAME OF PRAYING SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY SOMETHING OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RETURNED LEOPOLD OH HELEN HE BROKE OUT WITH A CRY STIFLED BY THE CAUTION THAT HAD GROWN HABITUAL TO BOTH OF THEM
8465-246943-0006 IS THERE NO HELP OF ANY KIND ANYWHERE SURELY MISTER WINGFOLD COULD TELL ME SOMETHING COMFORT ME SOMEHOW IF I WERE TO TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT I COULD TRUST THE MAN THAT SAID SUCH THINGS AS THOSE YOU TOLD ME THAT I COULD
8465-246943-0007 OH I WISH I HADN'T RUN AWAY BUT HAD LET THEM TAKE ME AND HANG ME HELEN FELT HERSELF GROW WHITE SHE TURNED AWAY AND PRETENDED TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED
8465-246943-0008 I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE TO YOU SHE SAID STILL STOOPING AND SHE FELT LIKE A DEVIL DRAGGING THE SOUL OF HER BROTHER TO HELL BUT THAT WAS A FOOLISH FANCY AND MUST BE RESISTED
8465-246943-0009 NOT IF I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LEOPOLD HISSED FROM BETWEEN HIS TEETH IN THE STRUGGLE TO KEEP DOWN A SHRIEK NO NOT IF YOU TOLD HIM EVERYTHING SHE ANSWERED AND FELT LIKE A JUDGE CONDEMNING HIM TO DEATH
8465-246943-0010 WHAT IS HE THERE FOR THEN SAID LEOPOLD INDIGNANTLY AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND MOANED HELEN HAD NOT YET THOUGHT OF ASKING HERSELF WHETHER HER LOVE TO HER BROTHER WAS ALL CLEAR LOVE AND NOWISE MINGLED WITH SELFISHNESS
8465-246943-0011 WHETHER IN THE FRESH HORROR THAT DAY POURED INTO THE CUP THAT HAD SEEMED ALREADY RUNNING OVER IT WAS OF HER BROTHER ONLY SHE THOUGHT OR WHETHER THREATENED SHAME TO HERSELF HAD NOT A PART IN HER MISERY
8465-246943-0012 FOR WHAT ATTEMPT EVEN HAD HE MADE TO COMFORT HER WHAT HAD HE DONE BUT UTTER COMMON PLACES AND TRUISMS ABOUT DUTY AND WHO COULD TELL BUT
8465-246943-0013 INDEED WAS SHE NOT CERTAIN THAT SUCH A MAN BRINGING THE ARTILLERY OF HIS FANATICISM TO BEAR UPON HER POOR BOY'S WILD ENTHUSIASTIC TEMPERAMENT WOULD SPEEDILY PERSUADE HIM TO MAKE A REALITY OF THAT TERRIBLE THING HE HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT HIDEOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBILITY
8465-246943-0014 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LONG SHE THOUGHT
8465-246943-0015 APPARENTLY SENSELESS ON THE PILLOW AND SHE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD THE SAME MOMENT SHE WAS FREE THE HORROR HAD DEPARTED FROM HER OWN ATMOSPHERE TOO AND SHE MADE HASTE TO RESTORE HIM
8465-246943-0016 BUT IN ALL SHE DID FOR HIM SHE FELT LIKE THE EXECUTIONER WHO GIVES RESTORATIVES TO THE WRETCH THAT HAS FAINTED ON THE RACK OR THE WHEEL WHAT RIGHT HAD SHE SHE THOUGHT TO MULTIPLY TO HIM HIS MOMENTS OF TORTURE
8465-246943-0017 IF THE CRUEL POWER THAT HAD CREATED HIM FOR SUCH MISERY WHOEVER WHATEVER WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE
8465-246943-0018 YET SHE HESITATED NOT A SINGLE MOMENT IN HER MINISTRATIONS THERE IS SO MUCH PASSES IN US OF WHICH OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TAKES NO GRASP OR BUT WITH SUCH A FLITTING TOUCH AS SCARCELY TO HAND IT OVER TO THE MEMORY
8465-246943-0019 THAT I FEEL ENCOURAGED TO DOUBT WHETHER EVER THERE WAS A MAN ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT HOPE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ALAS ARE MANY WHO ARE AWARE OF NO GROUND OF HOPE NAY EVEN WHO FEEL NO GLIMMER IN THEM OF ANYTHING THEY CAN CALL HOPE I KNOW
8465-246943-0020 BUT I THINK IN THEM ALL IS AN UNDERLYING UNCONSCIOUS HOPE I THINK THAT NOT ONE IN ALL THE WORLD HAS MORE THAN A SHADOWY NOTION OF WHAT HOPELESSNESS MEANS PERHAPS UTTER HOPELESSNESS IS THE OUTER DARKNESS
8465-246943-0021 AT LENGTH LEOPOLD OPENED HIS EYES
8465-246943-0022 NONSENSE DEAR POLDIE IT WAS ALL FANCY NOTHING MORE SHE RETURNED IN A VOICE ALMOST AS HOLLOW AS HIS AND THE LIGHTNESS OF THE WORDS UTTERED IN SUCH A TONE JARRED DISMAYFULLY ON HER OWN EAR FANCY HE REPEATED
8465-246943-0023 I KNOW WHAT FANCY IS AS WELL AS ANY MAN OR WOMAN BORN THAT WAS NO FANCY SHE STOOD THERE BY THE WARDROBE IN THE SAME DRESS HER FACE AS WHITE AS HER DRESS AND LISTEN I WILL TELL YOU
8465-246943-0024 I WILL SOON SATISFY YOU IT COULD BE NO FANCY HERE HE PUSHED HER FROM HIM AND LOOKED STRAIGHT IN HER EYES I SAW HER BACK REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR OF THE WARDROBE DOOR AND
8465-246943-0025 HERE THE FIXED LOOK OF HORROR THREATENED TO RETURN UPON HIS FACE BUT HE WENT ON LISTEN
8465-246943-0026 UGH I SAW IT IN THE MIRROR HIS VOICE HAD RISEN TO A STRANGLED SHRIEK HIS FACE WAS DISTORTED
8465-246943-0027 IF INDEED THAT BE A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF COURAGE AND IT IS NOT GATHERED RATHER FROM THE HIDDEN HOPE OF WHICH I SPEAK AND THE LOVE THAT WILL CLEAVE AND NOT FORSAKE SHE SET HER TEETH AND SAID LET HER COME THEN POLDIE I AM WITH YOU AND I DEFY HER
8465-246943-0028 SHE SHALL KNOW THAT A SISTER'S LOVE IS STRONGER THAN THE HATE OF A JILT EVEN IF YOU DID KILL HER BEFORE GOD POLDIE I WOULD AFTER ALL RATHER BE YOU THAN SHE SAY WHAT YOU WILL
8465-246943-0029 BUT LEOPOLD SEEMED NOT TO HEAR A WORD SHE SAID AND LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL
8465-246947-0000 AS WINGFOLD CAME OUT OF THE ROOM WHICH WAS NEAR THE STAIR HELEN ROSE FROM THE TOP OF IT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SITTING ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN WITH HER BROTHER HE CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HIM AND STEPPED SOFTLY ALONG THE LANDING
8465-246947-0001 A HUMAN SOUL IN GUILT AND AGONY IS AN AWFUL PRESENCE BUT THERE WAS MORE THAN THAT IN THE HUSH OF THE CURATE HE FELT AS IF HE HAD LEFT THE PHYSICIAN OF SOULS BEHIND HIM AT THE BEDSIDE
8465-246947-0002 BUT AT HIS HEAD STOOD ONE WHO WATCHED HIS THROES WITH THE THROBS OF SUCH A HUMAN HEART AS NEVER BEAT IN ANY BOSOM BUT HIS OWN AND THE EXECUTIONERS WERE ANGELS OF LIGHT NO WONDER IF WITH SUCH A FEELING IN HIS BREAST WINGFOLD WALKED SOFTLY AND HIS FACE GLISTENED
8465-246947-0003 HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE TEARS STOOD IN HIS EYES BUT HELEN SAW THEM YOU KNOW ALL SHE FALTERED I DO WILL YOU LET ME OUT BY THE GARDEN AGAIN I WISH TO BE ALONE SHE LED THE WAY DOWN THE STAIR
8465-246947-0004 AND WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE GARDEN WINGFOLD DID NOT SPEAK YOU DON'T THINK VERY BADLY OF MY POOR BROTHER DO YOU MISTER WINGFOLD SAID HELEN MEEKLY IT IS A TERRIBLE FATE HE RETURNED
8465-246947-0005 I THINK I NEVER SAW A LOVELIER DISPOSITION I DO HOPE HIS MIND WILL SOON BE MORE COMPOSED I THINK HE KNOWS WHERE ALONE HE CAN FIND REST I AM WELL AWARE HOW FOOLISH THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK SEEMS TO SOME MINDS MISS LINGARD
8465-246947-0006 BUT WHEN A MAN IS ONCE OVERWHELMED IN HIS OWN DEEDS WHEN THEY HAVE TURNED INTO SPECTRES TO MOCK AT HIM WHEN HE LOATHES HIMSELF AND TURNS WITH SICKNESS FROM PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE I KNOW BUT ONE CHOICE LEFT
8465-246947-0007 INTO THE LIFE I HOPE YOUR BROTHER WILL ENTER I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T HATE HIM HATE HIM WHO BUT A DEMON COULD HATE HIM HELEN LIFTED A GRATEFUL LOOK FROM EYES THAT SWAM IN TEARS
8465-246947-0008 THE TERROR OF HIS POSSIBLE COUNSEL FOR THE MOMENT VANISHED HE COULD NEVER TELL HIM TO GIVE HIMSELF UP
8465-246947-0009 THE DWARF EXCLAIMED HELEN SHUDDERING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH AT THE COTTAGE YES THAT MAN'S SOUL IS AS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND PATIENT AS HIS BODY IS INSIGNIFICANT AND DISTORTED AND TROUBLED
8465-246947-0010 HE IS THE WISEST AND BEST MAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN I MUST ASK LEOPOLD RETURNED HELEN WHO THE BETTER THE MAN WAS REPRESENTED FELT THE MORE JEALOUS AND FEARFUL OF THE ADVICE HE MIGHT GIVE
8465-246947-0011 HER LOVE AND HER CONSCIENCE WERE NOT YET AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER THEY PARTED AT THE DOOR FROM THE GARDEN AND SHE RETURNED TO THE SICK ROOM SHE PAUSED HESITATING TO ENTER ALL WAS STILL AS THE GRAVE SHE TURNED THE HANDLE SOFTLY AND PEEPED IN
8465-246947-0012 COULD IT BE THAT WINGFOLD'S BEARING HAD COMMUNICATED TO HER MIND A SHADOW OF THE AWE WITH WHICH HE HAD LEFT THE PLACE WHERE PERHAPS A SOUL WAS BEING BORN AGAIN LEOPOLD DID NOT MOVE TERROR LAID HOLD OF HER HEART
8465-246947-0013 SHE STEPPED QUICKLY IN AND ROUND THE SCREEN TO THE SIDE OF THE BED THERE TO HER GLAD SURPRISE HE LAY FAST ASLEEP WITH THE TEARS NOT YET DRIED UPON HIS FACE HER HEART SWELLED WITH SOME SENSE UNKNOWN BEFORE
8465-246947-0014 WAS IT RUDIMENTARY THANKFULNESS TO THE FATHER OF HER SPIRIT AS SHE STOOD GAZING WITH THE LOOK OF A MOTHER OVER HER SICK CHILD HE LIFTED HIS EYELIDS AND SMILED A SAD SMILE WHEN DID YOU COME INTO THE ROOM HE SAID A MINUTE AGO SHE ANSWERED
8465-246947-0015 I DID NOT HEAR YOU HE RETURNED NO YOU WERE ASLEEP NOT I MISTER WINGFOLD IS ONLY JUST GONE I HAVE LET HIM OUT ON THE MEADOW SINCE LEOPOLD STARED LOOKED HALF ALARMED AND THEN SAID
8465-246947-0016 DID GOD MAKE ME SLEEP HELEN SHE DID NOT ANSWER THE LIGHT OF A NEW HOPE IN HIS EYE AS IF THE DAWN HAD BEGUN AT LAST TO BREAK OVER THE DARK MOUNTAINS WAS ALREADY REFLECTED FROM HER HEART OH HELEN HE SAID
8465-246947-0017 THAT IS A GOOD FELLOW SUCH A GOOD FELLOW A PANG OF JEALOUSY THE FIRST SHE HAD EVER FELT SHOT TO HER HEART SHE HAD HITHERTO SINCE HIS TROUBLE BEEN ALL IN ALL TO HER LEOPOLD
8465-246947-0018 HAD THE CURATE BEEN A MAN SHE LIKED SHE WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE MINDED IT SO MUCH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT ME NOW SHE SAID SADLY I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND TAKING TO PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE MADE SO I SUPPOSE HELEN
8465-246947-0019 I KNOW I TOOK TO YOU AT FIRST SIGHT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WHEN I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A LONELY LITTLE FOREIGNER AND YOU A GREAT BEAUTIFUL LADY FOR SUCH YOU SEEMED TO ME THOUGH YOU HAVE TOLD ME SINCE YOU WERE ONLY A GREAT GAWKY GIRL
8465-246947-0020 I KNOW THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN YOU RAN TO MEET ME AND TOOK ME IN YOUR ARMS AND KISSED ME I WAS AS IF I HAD CROSSED THE SEA OF DEATH AND FOUND PARADISE IN YOUR BOSOM I AM NOT LIKELY TO FORGET YOU FOR MISTER WINGFOLD
8465-246947-0021 GOOD AND KIND AND STRONG AS HE IS EVEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET YOU HELEN BUT NEITHER YOU NOR I CAN DO WITHOUT MISTER WINGFOLD ANY MORE I FANCY I WISH YOU LIKED HIM BETTER
8465-246947-0022 BUT YOU WILL IN TIME YOU SEE HE'S NOT ONE TO PAY YOUNG LADIES COMPLIMENTS AS I HAVE HEARD SOME PARSONS DO AND HE MAY BE A LITTLE NO NOT UNPOLISHED NOT THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN BUT UNORNAMENTAL IN HIS MANNERS
8465-246947-0023 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM THOUGH YOU NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE THAT IS TRUE RETURNED LEOPOLD BUT THEN HE CAME TO ME WITH HIS DOOR OPEN AND LET ME WALK IN
8465-246947-0024 HE HASN'T GOT A SECRET LIKE US HELEN HE ADDED SADLY WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU MUCH WHAT HE SAID TO YOU FROM THE PULPIT THE OTHER DAY I SHOULD THINK THEN SHE WAS RIGHT FOR ALL HIS HARDNESS AND WANT OF SYMPATHY THE CURATE HAD YET HAD REGARD TO HER ENTREATIES
8465-246947-0025 AND WAS NOT GOING TO PUT ANY HORRID NOTIONS ABOUT DUTY AND SELF SACRIFICE INTO THE POOR BOY'S HEAD HE'S COMING AGAIN TO MORROW ADDED LEOPOLD ALMOST GLEEFULLY AND THEN PERHAPS HE WILL TELL ME MORE AND HELP ME ON A BIT DID HE TELL YOU HE WANTS TO BRING A FRIEND WITH HIM
8465-246947-0026 NO I CAN'T SEE THE GOOD OF TAKING MORE PEOPLE INTO OUR CONFIDENCE WHY SHOULD HE NOT DO WHAT HE THINKS BEST HELEN YOU DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE DOCTOR WHY SHOULD YOU WITH HIM WHEN A MAN IS GOING TO THE BOTTOM AS FAST AS HE CAN
8465-246947-0027 AND ANOTHER COMES DIVING AFTER HIM IT ISN'T FOR ME TO SAY HOW HE IS TO TAKE HOLD OF ME NO HELEN WHEN I TRUST I TRUST OUT AND OUT HELEN SIGHED THINKING HOW ILL THAT HAD WORKED WITH EMMELINE
8226-274371-0000 YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
8226-274371-0001 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
8226-274371-0002 ALL THIS CONSIDERED THERE IS A JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN UPON THIS NATION IF THESE DISTRACTIONS CONTINUE GOD SO DEAL WITH ME AND MINE AS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE UPRIGHT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUE PROTESTANT PROFESSION
8226-274371-0003 AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
8226-274371-0004 THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
8226-274371-0005 IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER
8226-274371-0006 WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS AND THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE PANICS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX
8226-274371-0007 ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
8226-274371-0008 HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
8226-274371-0009 AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
8226-274371-0010 GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
8226-274371-0011 AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS
8226-274371-0012 AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IN ALL COMMANDS THEREFORE WHICH THEY CONFERRED
8226-274371-0013 THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
8226-274371-0014 THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING
8226-274371-0015 WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0016 WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
8226-274371-0017 THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED
8226-274371-0018 MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS
8226-274371-0019 WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
8226-274371-0020 AND MORE ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE
8226-274371-0021 NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES
8226-274371-0022 AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
8226-274371-0023 LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
8226-274371-0024 WERE THE MEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL PARTY CHIEFLY COMPOSED SO SENSIBLE WAS CHARLES OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT HE TOOK CARE TO DISPERSE EVERY WHERE THE PAPERS OF THE PARLIAMENT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN
8226-274371-0025 BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
8226-274371-0026 TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED
8226-274371-0027 MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
8226-274371-0028 UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
8226-274371-0029 WOULD ADMIT HIM WITH HIS RETINUE AFTER WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY RENDER HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS ON HIS GUARD HE SHUT THE GATES AND REFUSED TO RECEIVE THE KING
8226-274371-0030 WHO DESIRED LEAVE TO ENTER WITH TWENTY PERSONS ONLY CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR
8226-274371-0031 THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
8226-274371-0032 THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS
8226-274371-0033 WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
8226-274371-0034 AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
8226-274371-0035 THEY ISSUED ORDERS FOR BRINGING IN LOANS OF MONEY AND PLATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FORCES WHICH SHOULD DEFEND THE KING AND BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FOR THIS STYLE THEY STILL PRESERVED WITHIN TEN DAYS
8226-274371-0036 AND WAIT TILL THE TREASURERS COULD FIND LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM SUCH ZEAL ANIMATED THE PIOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0037 NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0038 THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
8226-274371-0039 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0040 IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
8226-274371-0041 THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
8226-274371-0042 HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
8226-274371-0043 HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
8226-274371-0044 AND HE NEVER APPEARED GREATER THAN WHEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST PERILS AND DISTRESSES FROM THE MIXED CHARACTER INDEED OF CHARLES AROSE IN PART THE MISFORTUNES IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS AT THIS TIME INVOLVED
8226-274371-0045 THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
8226-274371-0046 THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0047 THAT NONE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY SHOULD MARRY WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT OR COUNCIL
8226-274371-0048 THAT THE VOTES OF POPISH LORDS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED THAT THE REFORMATION OF THE LITURGY AND CHURCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE PLACE ACCORDING TO ADVICE OF PARLIAMENT THAT THE ORDINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE MILITIA BE SUBMITTED TO
8226-274371-0049 THAT THE JUSTICE OF PARLIAMENT PASS UPON ALL DELINQUENTS THAT A GENERAL PARDON BE GRANTED WITH SUCH EXCEPTIONS AS SHOULD BE ADVISED BY PARLIAMENT THAT THE FORTS AND CASTLES BE DISPOSED OF BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0050 AND THAT NO PEER BE MADE BUT WITH CONSENT OF BOTH HOUSES SHOULD I GRANT THESE DEMANDS SAID THE KING IN REPLY I MAY BE WAITED ON BAREHEADED I MAY HAVE MY HAND KISSED
8226-274371-0051 THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME
8226-274371-0052 BUT THE PICTURE BUT THE SIGN OF A KING WAR ON ANY TERMS WAS ESTEEMED BY THE KING AND ALL THE COUNSELLORS PREFERABLE TO SO IGNOMINIOUS A PEACE
8226-274371-0053 AND THE HEARTS OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS WHICH WITH GOD'S BLESSING HE DOUBTED NOT WOULD RECOVER ALL THE REST COLLECTING THEREFORE SOME FORCES HE ADVANCED SOUTHWARDS
4014-186176-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE DEATH OF THE SPY
4014-186176-0001 THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT IT SEEMED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A TRAIL WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS LEADING HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE OBJECT OF THE HUNT AND IT WAS IN FORGING THE LINKS OF THIS CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS LED INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186176-0002 PRESUMABLY FROM THE ENGINE OR BOILER ROOM THROW ASIDE SOMETHING AS HE HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGEWAY LEADING FROM THE WIRELESS ROOM
4014-186176-0003 AND YOU STOOPED TO PICK UP WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN AWAY
4014-186176-0004 EVIDENTLY ALSO FROM THE BOILER OR ENGINE ROOM BRUSHED BY US HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SAILOR SAID TO ME I THINK THAT WAS THE FELLOW THE ONE THAT JUST WENT BY NOT WANTING TO AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS I ENDED THE CONVERSATION WITH A CASUAL REMARK AND THEN STROLLED AWAY UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE SAILOR'S SIGHT
4014-186176-0005 I WAS GROPING MY WAY ALONG WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD STEPS JUST AHEAD OF ME I STOPPED TO LISTEN AND WHEN THE SOUND WAS NOT REPEATED I PROCEEDED ONWARD
4014-186176-0006 BEFORE I COULD UTTER A WORD I WAS A PRISONER BEHIND A LOCKED DOOR I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES AND
4014-186176-0007 EVERY MOMENT IT BECAME MORE STIFLING IN THERE AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT I HAD WALKED DIRECTLY INTO A DEATH TRAP IT WAS THEN I BEGAN SIGNALING ON THE STEAM PIPE I GUESS IT WAS A MIGHTY LUCKY THING FOR ME THAT SLIM GOODWIN STROLLED OUT ON DECK JUST AT THE TIME HE DID
4014-186176-0008 AND THAT WAS ALL THAT LIEUTENANT MACKINSON COULD TELL THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER REMAINED WHAT HE HAD BEEN FROM THE FIRST A DESPERATE AND DANGEROUS AND UNKNOWN SPY
4014-186176-0009 PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER TO DEVISE A SCHEME OF CAPTURE WE'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE GOOD REASON FOR WANTING TO GET THIS FELLOW SLIM REMINDED THE OTHERS WITH CONSIDERABLE WARMTH
4014-186176-0010 TO WHICH HE IS AN ENEMY AND A TRAITOR BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS THAT KNOCKOUT THAT HE HANDED TO JOE AND THE MIDNIGHT SCARE HE GAVE JERRY AND ME AND FINALLY HIS EFFORT TO KILL LIEUTENANT MACKINSON BY SLOW SUFFOCATION
4014-186176-0011 WELL SAID JOE I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT WILL WORK BUT
4014-186176-0012 WELL WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION SLIM DEMANDED THAT WE DIVIDE OUR FORCES ANSWERED JOE SOLEMNLY LIE IN WAIT AND TRY TO AMBUSH THE FOE RIGHT CRIED JERRY JOE YOU'LL BE A GENERAL BEFORE THIS WAR'S OVER
4014-186176-0013 ALONG WHAT LINES DO WE DISPERSE OUR FORCES GENERAL ASKED SLIM ALONG WHAT LINES WOULD HIS ROYAL STOUTNESS SUGGEST DEMANDED JERRY OH YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING ME THAT I'M A TRIFLE HEAVY SLIM REPLIED IN A PEEVISH TONE
4014-186176-0014 A TRIFLE HEAVY GET THAT WILL YOU ECHOED JERRY WITH A GALE OF LAUGHTER A TRIFLE HEAVY OH MY YOU'LL FIND OUT IF I SIT ON YOU SLIM THREATENED IN A BELLIGERENT TONE
4014-186176-0015 WON'T DO IT SLIM MUTTERED OH YES YOU WILL COUNSELED JOE SHAKE HANDS THE TWO OF YOU SLIM'S GOOD NATURE OVERCAME HIS FEIGNED RELUCTANCE BUT AS JERRY GRASPED HIS HAND HE GAVE JERRY A JERK THAT NEARLY TOOK HIM OFF HIS FEET NOW WE'RE SQUARE SAID SLIM
4014-186176-0016 AND TO DO THAT HE WILL HAVE TO USE THE WIRELESS SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS EFFORT AT NIGHT
4014-186176-0017 THE LIEUTENANT COULD BE IN THE WIRELESS ROOM AND ONE OF US IN THE BATTERY ROOM WHILE THE OTHER TWO DID DUTY OUTSIDE
4014-186176-0018 IT WOULD BE TIRESOME AND MONOTONOUS WORK ALL RIGHT
4014-186176-0019 I'M WILLING SAID JERRY BUT YOU AND I WILL HAVE TO DO THE OUTSIDE WORK
4014-186176-0020 WELL I'LL COVER THE BATTERY ROOM SAID SLIM IGNORING JERRY'S REMARK LET'S SEE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THEN SUGGESTED JOE AND THEY WENT TO FIND THE YOUNG OFFICER WHO WAS CONVALESCING FROM HIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE SPY WHEN HE HAD APPROVED THE PLAN THEY GOT THE O K OF THE CAPTAIN
4014-186176-0021 TO THE THREE BOYS UNABLE TO SEE OR TALK TO EACH OTHER AND JOE AND JERRY SCARCELY DARING TO MOVE THE MINUTES LAGGED LIKE HOURS
4014-186176-0022 BLACK ENDLESS NIGHTS DAWN CAME
4014-186176-0023 THERE WERE MUTUAL FEELINGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT NONE OF WEAKENED DETERMINATION WHAT LUCK
4014-186176-0024 I WILL ARRANGE FOR ANOTHER MAN TO STAY IN THE WIRELESS ROOM DURING TO DAY
4014-186176-0025 THE SEA IS CALM AND WE READILY COULD DISCERN A PERISCOPE A LONG DISTANCE AWAY TRULY IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT AND IT WAS IN THIS ALLURING QUIET OF SEEMINGLY ABSOLUTE PEACE
4014-186176-0026 THE BRIGHTON BOYS AND THEIR FRIEND AND SUPERIOR OFFICER THE LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN IN THEIR APPOINTED PLACES HARDLY MORE THAN AN HOUR WHEN JOE AND JERRY AT THE SAME INSTANT CAUGHT THE SOUNDS OF SOME SORT OF SCUFFLE ON THE DECK ABOVE
4014-186176-0027 IT CAME NEARER AND CLEARER UNTIL FINALLY AS IT REACHED A POINT NEAR TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRWAY UNDER WHICH JOE WAS CONCEALED THE LATTER COULD DISCERN THE FOG HORN VOICE OF THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER
4014-186176-0028 THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER WAS A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OF A MAN BUT HIS VOICE BROKE OFF AS THE COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN CERTAINLY HE MUST HAVE A ROUGH CUSTOMER TO DEAL WITH THOUGHT JERRY
4014-186176-0029 YE WILL WILL YE HISSED THE VOICE OF THE ENGINEER AGAIN
4014-186176-0030 YE DIRTY HOUND I'VE A MIND TO BOOT YE INTO THE SEA
4014-186176-0031 AND WHIN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
4014-186176-0032 SO SAID THE CAPTAIN IN A VOICE SO STERN IT MADE JOE WINCE
4014-186176-0033 HE'S A THIRD CLASS MACHINIST SIR THE ENGINEER REPLIED
4014-186176-0034 YES AND I BELIEVE HE'S WORSE THAN THAT THE CAPTAIN ADDED
4014-186176-0035 THERE WAS A STRAINED SILENCE FOR A MOMENT THEN
4014-186176-0036 IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE'D CAUGHT THE MAN THE DOCTOR WHISPERED
4014-186176-0037 THERE WAS A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT FROM JOE FOLLOWED BY A LOUDER HOLY SMOKE FROM SLIM DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN THE CAPTAIN ASKED IN A SHARP TONE I SHOULD SAY I DO SIR JOE RESPONDED
4014-186176-0038 HE IS THE MAN WHO WAS PLANTING AMMUNITION IN THE WATERS NEAR THE NAVY YARD THAT NIGHT BEFORE WE SAILED THE VERY SAME ONE SIR SLIM EXCLAIMED WITH EQUAL POSITIVENESS THE SHIP'S SURGEON WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE OTHERS UPON DECK STEPPED CLOSER FOR A BETTER INSPECTION OF THIS ENEMY
4014-186176-0039 AT THE SAME INSTANT THE PRISONER
4014-186176-0040 AND THRUST THE ENGINEER FROM HIM BEFORE ANYONE COULD INTERFERE HE WAS DASHING DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE STERN JUST AS HE TOOK A WILD HEADLONG LEAP OVER THE RAIL THE CAPTAIN FIRED WHILE THE CAPTAIN THROUGH A SPEAKING TUBE WAS INSTRUCTING THE MAN IN THE PILOT HOUSE TO SIGNAL BELOW REVERSE ENGINES
4014-186176-0041 THE OTHERS RUSHED TO THE STERN OF THE SHIP FAR BEHIND THEM IN THE FOAMY TRAIL LEFT ON THE MOONLIT WATER BY THE VESSEL THEY SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE HEAD OF A MAN BOBBING UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED THE SHIP WAS TURNED
4014-186176-0042 GONE SAID THE CAPTAIN IN TONES OF VERY EVIDENT RELIEF WELL IT WAS DEATH FOR HIM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND HE TOOK HIS CHOICE AS THE CAPTAIN AND SURGEON MOVED AWAY FROM THE STERN RAIL OF THE EVERETT
4014-186176-0043 AND MADE ME RUN A MILE IN NOTHING FLAT ADDED JERRY AND FOUGHT ME TO A KNOCKOUT FINISH LATER MUSED JOE AND NEARLY SMOTHERED ME TO DEATH SPOKE THE LIEUTENANT AND WAS FINALLY CORRALLED BY AN IRISH ENGINEER SAID SLIM GONE CONCLUDED JERRY
4014-186183-0000 FRANK HOSKINS ELBOW WOUND HEALED QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS RESULTS AND TOM RAWLE WHO HAD BEEN UNDER TREATMENT AT THE FIELD HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT THE CAMP
4014-186183-0001 BUT ON THE EIGHTH DAY A VERITABLE FURY LAUNCHED ITSELF UPON THAT SECTION OF THE AMERICAN FRENCH FRONT IN THE SHAPE OF SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BRIGADES OF BOCHES THAT WERE HURLED OVER THE TOP OF THEIR OWN BREASTWORKS ACROSS NO MAN'S LAND AND UPON THE FIRST LINE TRENCHES OF THE ALLIES
4014-186183-0002 FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH AVIATORS HAD BEEN REPORTING HEAVY GERMAN FORMATIONS IN THAT REGION EVIDENTLY WITH THE DESIGN OF A TERRIFIC ASSAULT BUT THE ALLIED COMMANDERS HAD NOT EXPECTED IT SO SOON AND IN TRUTH THEY WERE NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR IT
4014-186183-0003 IT WAS A SURPRISE ATTACK IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE CARNAGE THAT SUCH A BATTLE BRINGS
4014-186183-0004 AND THEIR HIDDEN ARTILLERY TO THE REAR OF THEM THIS WAS KEPT UP FOR ABOUT SEVEN HOURS AND THE DUEL OF HEAVY GUNS SHOOK THE EARTH LIKE A QUAKE AND WAS DEAFENING THEN JUST AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE INFANTRY ONSLAUGHT
4014-186183-0005 INCLUDING FOOD AND AMMUNITION TRAINS
4014-186183-0006 EVERYTHING MOVED LIKE CLOCKWORK AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SPEED AND THROUGHOUT IT ALL MEN ON BOTH SIDES WERE SHOOTING SHOUTING SHRIEKING
4014-186183-0007 OR LIFELESS BEFORE SUPERIOR NUMBERS
4014-186183-0008 A STATIONARY BALLOON SHOWED WHERE JERRY AND AN OBSERVATION OFFICER WERE DOING DUTY ON THAT FATEFUL DAY JERRY WAS OPERATING A TELEPHONE THAT RAN DIRECTLY TO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS AND HARDLY A MOMENT PASSED WHEN HE WAS NOT REPEATING SOME OBSERVATION OF THE OTHER MAN IN THE BASKET WITH HIM
4014-186183-0009 EVERY DETAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BATTLE JERRY KNEW HIS OWN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OVER THE SIDE INFORMED HIM OF THE TEMPORARY REVERSES HIS OWN ARMY WAS SUFFERING WHILE THE REMARKS OF THE OFFICER TOLD HIM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE MEETING THEIR BITTEREST REPULSES
4014-186183-0010 WHERE THEY WERE DRAWING UP THEIR HEAVIEST FORCES OF RESERVES WHAT QUICK CHANGES WERE BEING MADE IN THEIR GENERAL LINE OF FORMATION AND HOW FAR BACK THEIR FORCES SEEMED TO EXTEND SLIM GOODWIN
4014-186183-0011 TO MAKE SURE THAT THUS FAR HIS FRIEND WAS STILL SAFE
4014-186183-0012 THE WAVERING SWAYING TARGET WAS WATCHED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SPECULATIONS MADE AS TO HOW LONG IT COULD REMAIN WITHOUT BEING PUNCTURED BY A BULLET
4014-186183-0013 IT WAS NOW WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON THE GERMANS HAD SWEPT INTO THE PLACES VACATED BY THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH AND STILL THE BATTLE RAGED IT WAS NOW THAT SLIM BEGAN TO WAIT ANXIOUSLY FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT
4014-186183-0014 THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH HAD RETREATED TO A GENERAL LINE WHICH PERMITTED A QUICK RE MOBILIZATION TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE THERE THEIR FRONT LINE RANKS HELD FIRM WHILE THE NEW FORMATION WAS BEING EFFECTED BEHIND THEM IT WAS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN THIS WAS COMPLETE
4014-186183-0015 AND SOON IN GREAT MEASURE AT LEAST HOSTILITIES WOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THE NIGHT THEIR WORK COMPLETED
4014-186183-0016 SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
4014-186183-0017 AND THE HEAVY ROAR OF THE ARTILLERY ALSO WAS PUNCTUATED WITH LONGER PAUSES
4014-186183-0018 WHILE EACH SIDE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND MADE NECESSARY REPAIRS OR ALTERED THEIR PLANS TO MEET THE NEW SITUATION OUR YOUNG FRIENDS WERE BUSY WITH WASH BASIN SOAP AND WATER
4014-186183-0019 TAKING OFF THE GRIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE EVENING MEAL AND WONDERING WHERE JERRY WAS KEEPING HIMSELF ALL THE WHILE WHEN SUDDENLY A VERY STRANGE THING HAPPENED BEYOND THE ENEMY'S LINE
4014-186183-0020 MORE EASILY HANDLED AEROPLANES AND USED IN GREAT NUMBERS BY THE GERMANS SHOT INTO THE AIR AT GREAT SPEED FROM BEHIND THE BOCHE ENTRENCHMENTS
4014-186183-0021 IT SIMPLY INDICATED THAT THOSE MANNING THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS
4014-186183-0022 AND EVEN THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A WELL DESIGNED HOAX
4014-186183-0023 STILL GOING AT MAXIMUM SPEED AND NOW ON A STRAIGHT LINE TOWARD THE AMERICAN SIDE WITHOUT SEEKING A FURTHER HEIGHT THE TAUBE SEVERAL TIMES WAVERED AND A MOMENT LATER ALMOST TURNED OVER BUT THE PILOT RIGHTED HER
4014-186183-0024 HE POINTED HER NOSE DOWNWARD TOWARD THE AMERICAN LINES FOUR AMERICAN PLANES SAILED OFF AND UPWARD TO MEET THE ONCOMING GERMAN AIR ARMADA BUT FROM THE GROUND IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE MAN IN THE OBSERVER'S PLACE IN THE TAUBE WAS MAKING DESPERATE SIGNALS
4014-186183-0025 THE AMERICAN PLANES MANEUVERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENCIRCLE THE TAUBE
4014-186183-0026 AND THE OTHER GERMAN PLANES TURNED BACK TOWARD THEIR OWN LINES THE TAUBE CONTINUED ON ITS WAVERING CRIPPLED DOWNWARD COURSE TOWARD THE ALLIED LINES
4014-186183-0027 AS THE TAUBE CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND AND RIGHTED HERSELF FOR A LANDING
4014-186183-0028 OF ITS OWN MOMENTUM IT ROLLED TO WITHIN A TWO MINUTES RUN OF WHERE THE LIEUTENANT AND THE OTHERS HAD BEEN STANDING IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF CURIOUS AMERICAN SOLDIERS
4014-186183-0029 AND AFTER DESCENDING A LITTLE BY PERMITTING SOME OF THE GAS TO ESCAPE WE JUMPED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BASKET AND CAME DOWN ON OUR PARACHUTES
4014-186183-0030 BUT SOME OTHER GERMAN AVIATORS SAW THE AFFAIR APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED OUR UNIFORMS AND HARDLY GAVE US TIME TO MAKE A DECENT START SAY JERRY CONCLUDED THEY CERTAINLY DID PEBBLE US WITH MACHINE GUN BULLETS
4014-186183-0031 OPENING THEM THE BOYS COULD HARDLY SUPPRESS THEIR JUBILATION STRIPPED OF THEIR OFFICIAL VERBIAGE THE LETTERS INFORMED THE YOUNG MEN THAT EACH OF THEM WAS MADE A CORPORAL JOE FOR VALOROUS SERVICE IN SAVING THE LIVES OF THREE AMERICANS ENTOMBED IN A CAVE
4014-186179-0000 THE FOLLOWING MORNING ALL OF THOSE WHO HAD ARRIVED ON THE TRANSPORTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP BUT IT WAS MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTION OF MEN AND EQUIPMENT AND WAS NOT TO BE FOR LONG
4014-186179-0001 IT WAS THAT SAME DAY THAT THE THREE BOYS FROM BRIGHTON WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME ASSIGNED TO A REGULAR UNIT OF THE SIGNAL CORPS ALSO WITH A REAL THRILL THEY LEARNED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO SEE WAR SERVICE FOR AMERICAN TROOPS WERE ALREADY IN THE TRENCHES
4014-186179-0002 HIS THREE ASSISTANTS ON THE TRIP ACROSS WERE THE FIRST ONES NAMED THE OTHER TWO WERE TOM RAWLE A FELLOW PROPORTIONED LIKE THEIR FIRST FRIEND IN THE SERVICE SERGEANT MARTIN AND A WIRY ENERGETIC QUICK SPEAKING YOUTH NAMED FRANK HOSKINS
4014-186179-0003 WE HAVE A LONG TRIP BEFORE US LIEUTENANT MACKINSON INFORMED THEM AND WE LEAVE HERE ON A SPECIAL TRAIN IN TWO HOURS IN A SHORT TIME WE WILL BE IN THE THICK OF IT
4014-186179-0004 KNOWING THEY HAVE IMPORTANT WORK TO DO AND FEELING CAPABLE OF DOING IT WELL
4014-186179-0005 GOT HERE TWO WEEKS AGO THE BIG FELLOW ANSWERED
4014-186179-0006 DID YOU GET WITHIN SOUND OF THE BIG GUNS ASKED SLIM EXCITEDLY I SHOULD SAY SO ANSWERED TOM RAWLE AND SO WILL YOU WITHIN A FEW HOURS ISN'T THAT SO HOSKINS YES ANSWERED FRANK
4014-186179-0007 HOSKINS KNOWS EXPLAINED RAWLE FOR HE GOT NEARER THAN I DID ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME FRANK CORRECTED MODESTLY BUT THEY CALLED IT MY BAPTISM OF FIRE I WAS OUT ONE NIGHT WITH AN ADVANCE PARTY WE WERE NEARLY AMBUSHED AND HAD TO BEAT A QUICK RETREAT
4014-186179-0008 WELL TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT DEMANDED TOM RAWLE IMPATIENT AT FRANK'S UNWILLINGNESS TO TALK MUCH ABOUT HIMSELF
4014-186179-0009 AND IT WAS A SURPRISE PARTY FOR FAIR I CAN TELL YOU
4014-186179-0010 THEN WE ALL DROPPED ON OUR STOMACHS AND WRIGGLED OUR WAY BACK INTO OUR OWN LINES WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DAMAGE BUT WE DID SOME RAPID WRIGGLING YOU CAN BET THERE WASN'T ANY TIME WASTED BY ANY OF US AND INASMUCH AS WE WERE APPARENTLY OUTNUMBERED
4014-186179-0011 SAY THAT MUST BE THRILLING TO BE A MEMBER OF AN ADVANCE PARTY LIKE THAT SAID JERRY HIS ENTHUSIASM AS FIERY AS HIS HAIR I WONDER IF WE'LL GET ANY WORK LIKE THAT YOU SURE WILL RESPONDED RAWLE AND PLENTY OF IT YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ON THAT SCORE
4014-186179-0012 ALL READY THEY ANSWERED AND THE LIEUTENANT LED THE WAY TO THE TRAIN
4014-186179-0013 ALSO THERE WAS A WIRE COMPANY OF THE SIGNAL CORPS WHICH WAS GOING TO JOIN ANOTHER AMERICAN UNIT FOR THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF THE TRIP THE LADS
4014-186179-0014 AND FROM THEM THEY HEARD MANY SERIOUS AND AMUSING STORIES MANY TRUE TALES OF THE ATTACK AND RETREAT OF SHOT AND SHELL AND SHRAPNEL AND THE HAND GRENADE AND THE POISONOUS GAS BOMBS THROWN BY THE BOCHES AND THEN ONE BY ONE THE SOLDIERS OF UNCLE SAM DROPPED OFF INTO LONG
4014-186179-0015 AND RESTFUL SLUMBER SLUMBER THAT WAS TO FIT THEM FOR HARD AND DIFFICULT DUTIES AHEAD THIS IS WHERE WE GET OFF FINALLY ANNOUNCED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON SHAKING THE LADS INTO WAKEFULNESS
4014-186179-0016 WITHOUT THE WASTE OF A MOMENT THEY CLIMBED IN LIEUTENANT MACKINSON OUR THREE FRIENDS YOUNG HOSKINS AND THE TOWERING RAWLE IN ANOTHER INSTANT THEY WERE SPEEDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THE BREAK OF DAWN
4014-186179-0017 WHERE IN THAT COUNTRY THEY HAD SEEN BIG CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND
4014-186179-0018 IN THE EASTERN PART OF FRANCE THEY CAME UPON ACTUAL WAR IN ALL ITS FATEFUL PROGRESS WITH WHOLE TOWNS DEMOLISHED FORESTS AND ORCHARDS BLOTTED OUT STARK RUIN WRITTEN OVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH
4014-186179-0019 LONG STRINGS OF POWERFUL MOTOR TRUCKS DRIVING TOWARD THE SCENE OF ACTION THEY CAME UPON TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN THAT AREA KNOWN AS BEHIND THE LINES WHERE FRENCH AMERICAN BELGIAN AND BRITISH SOLDIERS WERE RECUPERATING AFTER HARD DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE FRONT LINE TRENCHES
4014-186179-0020 BY THIS TIME THEY WERE WELL WITHIN SOUND OF THE HEAVY GUNS AND THEIR DRIVER TOLD THEM THAT THE ARTILLERY DUEL THEN GOING ON HAD BEEN IN PROGRESS FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AT LEAST
4014-186179-0021 IN PREPARATION FOR A GREAT INFANTRY ADVANCE BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TIME THEY EXPECT TO GO FORWARD BEFORE THE END OF TO DAY WHICH MEANS ADDED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON
4014-186179-0022 ON AND ON THEY WENT AND NEARER AND NEARER TO THE SCENE OF ACTUAL BATTLE THEY CAME THEY PASSED THE THIRD LINE TRENCHES AND NOW IN PLACES THEY SEEMED TO BE IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH SOME OF THE CONCEALED ARTILLERY
4014-186179-0023 THAT WAS POUNDING AWAY AT THE ENEMY IN TERRIBLE DETONATIONS THAT SHOOK AND ROCKED THE GROUND EVERY MINUTE AT THE SECOND LINE TRENCHES THEIR ORDERS CALLED FOR A HALT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE TOLD THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING
4014-186179-0024 WAS A CONSTANTLY MOVING LINE OF MOTOR TRUCKS COMING FORWARD WITH MEN AND SHELLS WHILE OUT AHEAD OF THEM TREMENDOUS AND MENACING BIG TANKS
4014-186179-0025 WERE PURSUING THEIR UNEVEN COURSE TOWARD THE FRONT IN PREPARATION FOR A NEW KIND OF ASSAULT THEY LOOK LIKE MINIATURE BATTLESHIPS ON LAND DON'T THEY EXCLAIMED SLIM
4014-186179-0026 EQUIPPED WITH GUNS AND MEN THAT COULD TRAVEL WITH THEIR OWN POWER PRACTICALLY ANYWHERE ACROSS SHELL HOLES OVER TRENCHES THROUGH BARBED WIRE
4014-186179-0027 AWAIT ME HERE HE SAID TO THE FIVE MEN UNDER HIS IMMEDIATE COMMAND
4014-186179-0028 AND THE LATTER IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A QUICK EXAMINATION OF HIS ENGINE AND TIRES WHICH PROMISED ANOTHER EARLY MOVE WE GO FORWARD AS FAR AS WE CAN BY AUTOMOBILE AGAIN THE LIEUTENANT INFORMED THEM
4014-186179-0029 AND AFTER DARK TO NIGHT WE ARE TO ESTABLISH AN OUTLYING COMMUNICATION FROM THE FARTHEST SKIRMISH POINTS TO HEADQUARTERS ALMOST AS HE FINISHED THE SENTENCE THEY WERE STARTED
4014-186179-0030 JOE REMARKED UPON IT IN TONES OF OPEN ADMIRATION IT'S NOTHING THE YOUTHFUL CHAUFFEUR REPLIED YOU'LL GET USED TO IT TOO AS HE TURNED THE AUTOMOBILE AND STARTED BACKWARD SLIM SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT THEY HADN'T EVEN HEARD HIS NAME DON'T KNOW IT SAID HOSKINS
4014-186179-0031 THEY HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO THE QUARTERS OF MAJOR JONES IN CHARGE OF THE SIGNAL CORPS MEN IN THAT SECTION AND IT WAS WITH CONSIDERABLE SURPRISE THAT THE BOYS LEARNED UPON ARRIVING THERE THAT THEY WERE TO ACCOMPANY THE LIEUTENANT INTO THE SUPERIOR OFFICER'S PRESENCE FOR INSTRUCTIONS
4014-186179-0032 HE WAS A MAN THEY FOUND ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD ALREADY GRIZZLED AND HARDENED BY HIS FIELD EXPERIENCE AND HE KNEW HOW TO CONVEY ORDERS AND TRANSACT BUSINESS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY YOU ARE TO FOLLOW THE RED INK LINES ON THIS MAP HE TOLD LIEUTENANT MACKINSON
4014-186179-0033 AS THEY ALL LEANED OVER HIS DESK TO FOLLOW THE TRACING OF HIS PENCIL WITH WHICH HE SHOWED THEM THE COURSE THEY WERE TO TAKE
4014-186179-0034 YOU WILL SEEK A SUITABLE LOCATION FROM WHICH TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATIONS YOU WILL DETERMINE WHETHER IT CAN BE DONE BY WIRELESS AS SOON AS YOU CAN DO SO REPORT WHAT PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE USE EVERY CAUTION FOR YOU WILL BE IN THE COUNTRY OCCUPIED BY THE ENEMY
4014-186179-0035 YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS EVENING IT IS NOW SIX FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THEY HAD EXAMINED THEIR ARMS AND EQUIPPED THEMSELVES WITH A FULL SUPPLY OF SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION PORTABLE WIRELESS INSTRUMENT AND ANTENNAE AND THREE RATIONS EACH OF EATING CHOCOLATE
4014-186179-0036 AND IF WOUNDED MIGHT OTHERWISE STARVE TO DEATH
4014-186179-0037 AND PROMPTLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THEY STARTED UPON THE DANGEROUS MISSION WITH NIGHTFALL THE BIG CANNONADING HAD NOTICEABLY SHUT DOWN
4014-186179-0038 IT WAS A BLACK NIGHT AND THEY PROCEEDED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION THEY DID NOT DARE USE THE FLASHLIGHTS THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED AND FREQUENTLY ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO DROP SUDDENLY FLAT UPON THE GROUND AS A BIG ROCKET WENT UP FROM EITHER SIDE
4014-186179-0039 IN THIS WAY THEY WENT FORWARD YARD BY YARD UNTIL THEY REACHED A THICK CLUMP OF TREES THERE AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITHOUT HEARING A DANGEROUS SOUND THEY SPREAD OUT THEIR COATS TENT LIKE WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON WITH GINGERLY FLASHES OF HIS LIGHT
4014-186179-0040 EXAMINED THE MAP AGAIN TO MAKE CERTAIN OF THEIR LOCATION
4014-186179-0041 WHILE TOM RAWLE QUIETLY CHUCKLING AT THE FAT LAD'S MISFORTUNE AIDED HIM TO HIS FEET DOWN FLAT SAID MACKINSON AGAIN AS HE DISCERNED SEVERAL SHADOWS MOVING ACROSS A SPACE A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH OF THEM
4014-186179-0042 FOR FULLY TEN MINUTES WHICH SEEMED LIKE AN HOUR THEY LAY THERE NOT DARING TO MOVE THEY WATCHED THE ENEMY SCOUTING PARTY GET A LIKE SCARE AND THEN AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A WHISPERED CONSULTATION TURN BACK TO THE GERMAN LINES

7511-102420-0003 FLASH AFTER FLASH OF THE MOST BLINDING LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY DEAFENING PEALS OF THUNDER AND AS IT ECHOED FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN THE UPROAR WAS TERRIFYING I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED A STORM THE BEAT OF HAIL AND RAIN AND THE ROAR OF WIND
7511-102420-0004 ALWAYS APPEAL TO ME BUT THERE WAS NEITHER WIND NOR RAIN JUST FLASH AND ROAR BEFORE THE ECHO DIED AWAY AMONG THE HILLS ANOTHER BOOMING REPORT WOULD SEEM TO SHIVER THE ATMOSPHERE AND SET ALL OUR TINWARE JANGLING
7511-102420-0005 WE ARE CAMPED SO NEAR THE GREAT PINES THAT I WILL CONFESS I WAS POWERFULLY AFRAID HAD THE LIGHTNING STRUCK ONE OF THE BIG PINES THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF US LEFT I COULD HEAR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MURMURING HER PRAYERS WHEN THERE WAS A LULL
7511-102420-0006 WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
7511-102420-0007 IN THE LULLS OF THE STORM I COULD HEAR THE MEN'S VOICES HIGH AND EXCITED THEY TOO WERE UP IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE STORM LASTED FOR HOURS BUT AT LAST IT MOVED OFF UP THE VALLEY THE FLASHES GREW TO BE A MERE GLIMMER
7511-102420-0008 AND THE THUNDER MERE RUMBLING THE PINES BEGAN TO MOAN AND SOON A LITTLE BREEZE WHISTLED BY SO WE LAY DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING THE HORSES COULD NOT BE FOUND THE STORM HAD FRIGHTENED THEM AND THEY HAD TRIED TO GO HOME
7511-102420-0009 THE MEN HAD TO FIND THEM AND AS IT TOOK MOST OF THE DAY WE HAD TO PUT OFF OUR HUNT WE WERE UP AND ABOUT NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST FAINT GRAY LIGHT WHILE THE MEN FED GRAIN TO THE HORSES AND SADDLED THEM WE PREPARED A HASTY BREAKFAST
7511-102420-0010 WE WERE OFF BEFORE IT WAS MORE THAN LIGHT ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE THE TRAIL DAWN IN THE MOUNTAINS HOW I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IF I COULD ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL THE KEEN BRACING AIR THE EXHILARATING CLIMB
7511-102420-0011 GREENISH AMBER LIGHT AND A BLUE GRAY SKY FAR AHEAD OF US WE COULD SEE THE RED RIM ROCK OF A MOUNTAIN ABOVE TIMBER LINE THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN TURNED THE JAGGED PEAKS INTO GOLDEN POINTS OF A CROWN IN OKLAHOMA
7511-102420-0012 EVEN AT THIS SEASON BUT HERE THERE ARE NO SONG BIRDS AND ONLY THE SNAPPING OF TWIGS AS OUR HORSES CLIMBED THE FROSTY TRAIL BROKE THE SILENCE WE HAD BEEN CAUTIONED NOT TO TALK BUT NEITHER MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY NOR I WANTED TO
7511-102420-0013 THE SUN WAS WELL UP WHEN WE REACHED THE LITTLE PARK WHERE WE PICKETED OUR HORSES THEN CAME A LONG HARD CLIMB IT IS HARD CLIMBING AT THE BEST AND WHEN THERE IS A BIG GUN TO CARRY IT IS VERY HARD
7511-102420-0014 THEN TOO WE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THE MEN AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT EASY TO DO AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP AND SAT DOWN ON SOME BOULDERS TO REST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED DOWN TO THE HUNTING GROUND WHICH LAY IN A CUPLIKE VALLEY FAR BELOW US
7511-102420-0015 WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
7511-102420-0016 IN THEIR PLACES STOOD SILVERY PATCHES AGAINST THE RED BACKGROUND OF THE CLIFFS HIGH OVERHEAD A TRIANGLE OF WILD GEESE HARROWED THE BLUE SKY I WAS PLUMB OUT OF BREATH BUT MEN WHO ARE MOST GALLANT ELSEWHERE ARE
7511-102420-0017 ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS ON A HUNT I WAS SCARCELY THROUGH PANTING BEFORE WE BEGAN TO DESCEND WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD MOVE SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF RANGE OF EACH OTHER'S GUNS THEN MISTER HAYNES AND MYSELF STARTED ONE WAY
7511-102420-0018 AND MISTER STRUBLE AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY THE OTHER WE WERE TO MEET WHERE THE VALLEY TERMINATED IN A BROAD PASS WE FELT SURE WE COULD GET A CHANCE AT WHAT ELK THERE MIGHT BE IN THE VALLEY WE WERE FOLLOWING FRESH TRACKS AND A LITTLE OF THE HUNTER'S ENTHUSIASM SEIZED ME
7511-102420-0019 WE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEM FAR WHEN THREE COWS AND A SPIKE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE PINES A LITTLE AHEAD OF US INSTANTLY MISTER HAYNES'S GUN FLEW TO HIS SHOULDER AND A DEAFENING REPORT JARRED OUR EARS HE RAN FORWARD
7511-102420-0020 BUT I STOOD STILL FASCINATED BY WHAT I SAW OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS BOUNDED BY A RIM OF ROCK OVER THE RIM WAS A SHEER WALL OF ROCK FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO WHERE THE GROS VENTRE WAS ANGRILY ROARING BELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM
7511-102420-0021 ROSE THE RED CLIFFS WITH THEIR JAGGED CRAGS AT THE REPORT OF THE GUN TWO HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE ALMOST AS LARGE AS A HOUSE DETACHED THEMSELVES AND FELL AT THE SAME INSTANT ONE OF THE QUAKING ASP GROVES
7511-102420-0022 BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES I SHUT THEM A MOMENT BUT WHEN I LOOKED THE GROVE WAS MOVING FASTER IT SLID SWIFTLY AND I COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE RATTLE OF STONES FALLING AGAINST STONES UNTIL WITH A MUFFLED ROAR
7511-102420-0023 THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
7511-102420-0024 NOT AN EARTHQUAKE YOU ARE AS WHITE AS A GHOST COME ON UP HERE AND SEE MY FINE ELK I SAT ON A LOG WATCHING HIM DRESS HIS ELK WE HAVE FOUND IT BEST NOT TO REMOVE THE SKIN
7511-102420-0025 BUT THE ELK HAVE TO BE QUARTERED SO AS TO LOAD THEM ON TO A HORSE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISTER STRUBLE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS JUST THEN THEY HAD SEEN A BIG BUNCH OF ELK HEADED BY A SPLENDID BULL BUT GOT NO SHOT AND THE ELK WENT OUT OF THE PASS
7511-102420-0026 THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
7511-102420-0027 HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS ELK TEETH THOUGH I DON'T ADMIRE THEM THEY ARE CONSIDERED VALUABLE HOWEVER HIS ELK WAS A COW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AS NICE TEETH AS DO BULLS WE HAD LUNCH AND THE MEN COVERED THE ELK WITH PINE BOUGHS
7511-102420-0028 TO KEEP THE CAMP ROBBERS FROM PECKING IT FULL OF HOLES NEXT DAY THE MEN WOULD COME WITH THE HORSES AND PACK IT IN TO CAMP WE ALL FELT REFRESHED SO WE STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THOSE THAT GOT AWAY
7511-102420-0029 FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0030 AND WINDFALL SO THICK THAT WE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WE WERE OBLIGED TO PICK OUR WAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID NOISE AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER NOT HAVING COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED BETTER TO SEPARATE
7511-102420-0031 WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
7511-102420-0032 THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
7511-102420-0033 WE WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND MISTER HAYNES SAID TO ME REST YOUR GUN ON THAT ROCK AND AIM AT THE FIRST RIB BACK OF THE SHOULDER IF YOU SHOOT HAPHAZARD YOU MAY CRIPPLE AN ELK AND LET IT GET AWAY TO DIE IN MISERY SO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU FIRE
7511-102420-0034 IT DIDN'T SEEM A MINUTE BEFORE WE HEARD THE BEAT OF THEIR HOOFS AND A QUEER PANTING NOISE THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE FIRST CAME A BEAUTIFUL THING WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH
7511-102420-0035 HIS EYES WERE STARTLED AND HIS SHINING BLACK MANE SEEMED TO BRISTLE I HEARD THE REPORT OF GUNS AND HE TUMBLED IN A CONFUSED HEAP HE TRIED TO RISE BUT OTHERS COMING LEAPED OVER HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN SOME MORE SHOTS
7511-102420-0036 AND THOSE BEHIND TURNED AND WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME MISTER HAYNES SHOUTED TO ME SHOOT SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT SO I FIRED MY KRAG BUT NEXT I FOUND MYSELF PICKING MYSELF UP
7511-102420-0037 AND WONDERING WHO HAD STRUCK ME AND FOR WHAT I WAS SO DIZZY I COULD SCARCELY MOVE BUT I GOT DOWN TO WHERE THE OTHERS WERE EXCITEDLY ADMIRING THE TWO DEAD ELK THAT THEY SAID WERE THE VICTIMS OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S GUN
7511-102420-0038 SHE WAS AS EXCITED AND DELIGHTED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT KILL ANYTHING SURE IT'S MANY A MEAL THEY'LL MAKE FOR LITTLE HUNGRY MOUTHS SHE SAID SHE WAS RUBBING HER SHOULDER RUEFULLY
7511-102420-0039 I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
7511-102420-0040 AND THE WAY YOU HELD YOUR GUN IT IS A WONDER IT DIDN'T KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF INSTEAD OF JUST SMASHING YOUR JAW THE MEN WORKED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AT THE ELK AND WE HELPED AS MUCH AS WE COULD BUT IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE REACHED CAMP
7511-102420-0041 SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
7511-102420-0042 THAT I HATED ANY ONE TO SEE ME AND MY HEAD ACHED FOR TWO DAYS IT HAS BEEN SNOWING FOR A LONG TIME BUT CLYDE SAYS HE WILL TAKE ME HUNTING WHEN IT STOPS
7511-102420-0043 AND GO BACK EMPTY HANDED AND PARTLY TO GET A REST FROM MISTER MURRY'S EVERLASTING ACCORDION MISTER MURRY IS AN OLD TIME ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S HE HAS A RANCH DOWN ON THE RIVER SOMEWHERE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS NOT SEEN HIM FOR YEARS
7511-102420-0044 DIDN'T KNOW HE LIVED UP HERE HE HAD SEEN THE GAME WARDEN FROM WHOM SHE HAD PROCURED HER LICENSE AND SO HUNTED UP OUR CAMP HE IS AN ODD LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH SAD EYES AND A DROOPING MOUTH WHICH GIVES HIS FACE A MOST HOPELESS REPROACHFUL EXPRESSION
7511-102420-0045 HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
7511-102420-0046 AS IF FASCINATED UNTIL I SENT HER FROM THE TABLE AND WENT OUT TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT GAZING WHY MAMMA SHE SAID I HAD TO LOOK HE HAS SWALLOWED SOMETHING THAT WON'T GO EITHER UP OR DOWN AND I'M FRAID HE'LL CHOKE
7511-102420-0047 ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT MISTER MURRY'S APPEARANCE I CAN ABOUT HIS TASTE FOR HE ADMIRES MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IT SEEMS THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HE HAS MADE ATTEMPTS TO MARRY HER AS HE GOT UP FROM SUPPER THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US HE SAID
7511-102420-0048 MARY ELLEN I HAVE A REAL TREAT AND SURPRISE FOR YOU JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES AN I'LL BET YOU'LL BE HAPPY WE TOOK OUR ACCUSTOMED PLACES AROUND THE FIRE WHILE MISTER MURRY HOBBLED HIS CAYUSE AND TOOK AN ODD LOOKING BUNDLE FROM HIS SADDLE
7511-102420-0049 HE SEATED HIMSELF AND TOOK FROM THE BUNDLE AN ACCORDION HE SET IT UPON HIS KNEE AND BEGAN PULLING AND PUSHING ON IT HE DID WHAT MISTER STRUBLE SAID WAS DOLING A DOLEFUL TUNE EVERY ONE TOOK IT GOOD NATUREDLY
7511-102420-0050 BUT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO RUN NIGGER RUN AND THE OLD GRAY HOSS COME A TEARIN OUT THE WILDERNESS I'LL SING THEM TO YOU WHEN I COME TO DENVER
5867-48852-0000 BELL HAD DECLARED THAT HER SISTER WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE JOHN EAMES IF HE WOULD GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND HE HAD REPLIED THAT OF COURSE HE WOULD GO THERE SO MUCH HAVING BEEN AS IT WERE SETTLED
5867-48852-0001 HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK OF HIS VISIT AS A MATTER OF COURSE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE ON THE MORNING AFTER THE EARL'S DINNER PARTY I MUST GET YOU TO COME ROUND WITH ME DALE AND SEE WHAT I AM DOING TO THE LAND THE EARL SAID
5867-48852-0002 BUT THE SQUIRE PREFERRED WALKING AND IN THIS WAY THEY WERE DISPOSED OF SOON AFTER BREAKFAST JOHN HAD IT IN HIS MIND TO GET BELL TO HIMSELF FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH HER BUT IT EITHER HAPPENED THAT LADY JULIA WAS TOO KEEN IN HER DUTIES AS A HOSTESS
5867-48852-0003 OR ELSE AS WAS MORE POSSIBLE BELL AVOIDED THE MEETING NO OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH AN INTERVIEW OFFERED ITSELF THOUGH HE HUNG ABOUT THE DRAWING ROOM ALL THE MORNING YOU HAD BETTER WAIT FOR LUNCHEON NOW LADY JULIA SAID TO HIM ABOUT TWELVE
5867-48852-0004 BUT THIS HE DECLINED AND TAKING HIMSELF AWAY HID HIMSELF ABOUT THE PLACE FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF DURING THIS TIME HE CONSIDERED MUCH WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO RIDE OR WALK IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM ANY HOPE
5867-48852-0005 HE COULD RIDE BACK TRIUMPHANT AS A FIELD MARSHAL THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO HIM BUT IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM NO HOPE IF IT SHOULD BE HIS DESTINY TO BE REJECTED UTTERLY ON THAT MORNING THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE TERRIBLY IN THE WAY OF HIS SORROW
5867-48852-0006 RESTING WHEN HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO REST AND RUNNING WHEN IT MIGHT SUIT HIM TO RUN AND SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE WON'T CARE FOR MY BOOTS BEING DIRTY SO AT LAST HE ELECTED TO WALK
5867-48852-0007 STAND UP TO HER BOLDLY MAN THE EARL HAD SAID TO HIM BY GEORGE WHAT IS THERE TO BE AFRAID OF
5867-48852-0008 THERE'S NOTHING SETS EM AGAINST A MAN LIKE BEING SHEEPISH HOW THE EARL KNEW SO MUCH
5867-48852-0009 I AM NOT PREPARED TO SAY BUT EAMES TOOK HIS ADVICE AS BEING IN ITSELF GOOD AND RESOLVED TO ACT UPON IT NOT THAT ANY RESOLUTION WILL BE OF ANY USE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED ALONG
5867-48852-0010 WHEN THE MOMENT COMES I KNOW THAT I SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE HER AND I KNOW THAT SHE'LL SEE IT
5867-48852-0011 HE HAD LAST SEEN HER ON THE LAWN BEHIND THE SMALL HOUSE JUST AT THAT TIME WHEN HER PASSION FOR CROSBIE WAS AT THE STRONGEST EAMES HAD GONE THITHER IMPELLED BY A FOOLISH DESIRE TO DECLARE TO HER HIS HOPELESS LOVE
5867-48852-0012 AND SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED MISTER CROSBIE BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES OF COURSE SHE HAD DONE SO AT THAT TIME BUT NEVERTHELESS HER MANNER OF TELLING HIM HAD SEEMED TO HIM TO BE CRUEL AND HE ALSO HAD BEEN CRUEL
5867-48852-0013 HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE HATED CROSBIE CALLING HIM THAT MAN AND ASSURING HER THAT NO EARTHLY CONSIDERATION SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO GO INTO THAT MAN'S HOUSE THEN HE HAD WALKED AWAY MOODILY WISHING HIM ALL MANNER OF EVIL
5867-48852-0014 WAS IT NOT SINGULAR THAT ALL THE EVIL THINGS WHICH HE IN HIS MIND HAD MEDITATED FOR THE MAN HAD FALLEN UPON HIM CROSBIE HAD LOST HIS LOVE HE HAD SO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A VILLAIN THAT HIS NAME MIGHT NOT BE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED
5867-48852-0015 HE HAD BEEN IGNOMINIOUSLY THRASHED BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL THIS BE IF HIS IMAGE WERE STILL DEAR TO LILY'S HEART I TOLD HER THAT I LOVED HER THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF THOUGH I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO
5867-48852-0016 AT ANY RATE I HAVE A RIGHT TO TELL HER NOW WHEN HE REACHED ALLINGTON HE DID NOT GO IN THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND UP TO THE FRONT OF THE SMALL HOUSE BY THE CROSS STREET BUT TURNED BY THE CHURCH GATE AND PASSED OVER THE SQUIRE'S TERRACE
5867-48852-0017 HERE HE ENCOUNTERED HOPKINS
5867-48852-0018 MISTER JOHN MAY I MAKE SO BOLD AND HOPKINS HELD OUT A VERY DIRTY HAND WHICH EAMES OF COURSE TOOK UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CAUSE OF THIS NEW AFFECTION I'M JUST GOING TO CALL AT THE SMALL HOUSE AND I THOUGHT I'D COME THIS WAY
5867-48852-0019 TO BE SURE THIS WAY OR THAT WAY OR ANY WAY WHO'S SO WELCOME MISTER JOHN I ENVIES YOU I ENVIES YOU MORE THAN I ENVIES ANY MAN IF I COULD A GOT HIM BY THE SCUFF OF THE NECK I'D A TREATED HIM JIST LIKE ANY WERMIN I WOULD INDEED HE WAS WERMIN I
5867-48852-0020 OLLAYS SAID IT I HATED HIM OLLAYS I DID INDEED MISTER JOHN
5867-48852-0021 HE NEVER LOOKED AT ONE AS THOUGH ONE WERE A CHRISTIAN DID HE MISTER JOHN
5867-48852-0022 ONLY SHE POOR YOUNG LADY SHE'LL BE BETTER NOW MISTER JOHN A DEAL BETTER
5867-48852-0023 TELL ME MISTER JOHN DID YOU GIVE IT HIM WELL WHEN YOU GOT HIM I HEARD YOU DID TWO BLACK EYES AND ALL HIS FACE ONE MASH OF GORE AND HOPKINS WHO WAS BY NO MEANS A YOUNG MAN STIFFLY PUT HIMSELF INTO A FIGHTING ATTITUDE
5867-48852-0024 EAMES PASSED ON OVER THE LITTLE BRIDGE WHICH SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF FAST DECAY UNATTENDED TO BY ANY FRIENDLY CARPENTER NOW THAT THE DAYS OF ITS USE WERE SO NEARLY AT AN END AND ON INTO THE GARDEN LINGERING ON THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD LAST SAID FAREWELL TO LILY
5867-48852-0025 BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN IN THE GARDEN AND NO SOUND TO BE HEARD AS EVERY STEP BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HER WHOM HE WAS SEEKING HE BECAME MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS ERRAND HIM SHE HAD NEVER LOVED
5867-48852-0026 AND WHY SHOULD HE VENTURE TO HOPE THAT SHE WOULD LOVE HIM NOW
5867-48852-0027 HAD HE NOT BEEN AWARE THAT HIS PROMISE TO OTHERS REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD PERSEVERE HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD DO THIS THING AND HE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD BUT HE HARDLY VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL
5867-48852-0028 IN THIS FRAME OF MIND HE SLOWLY MADE HIS WAY UP ACROSS THE LAWN MY DEAR THERE IS JOHN EAMES SAID MISSUS DALE WHO HAD FIRST SEEN HIM FROM THE PARLOUR WINDOW DON'T GO MAMMA
5867-48852-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD NO MAMMA NO WHAT GOOD CAN IT DO IT CAN DO NO GOOD I LIKE HIM AS WELL AS I CAN LIKE ANY ONE I LOVE HIM DEARLY BUT IT CAN DO NO GOOD LET HIM COME IN HERE AND BE VERY KIND TO HIM
5867-48852-0030 AND I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM THEN MISSUS DALE WENT ROUND TO THE OTHER ROOM AND ADMITTED HER VISITOR THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE DRAWING ROOM WE ARE IN TERRIBLE CONFUSION JOHN ARE WE NOT AND SO YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO LIVE IN GUESTWICK
5867-48852-0031 WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOES IT NOT BUT TO TELL YOU A SECRET ONLY IT MUST BE A SECRET YOU MUST NOT MENTION IT AT GUESTWICK MANOR EVEN BELL DOES NOT KNOW WE HAVE HALF MADE UP OUR MINDS TO UNPACK ALL OUR THINGS AND STAY WHERE WE ARE
5867-48852-0032 EAMES WAS SO INTENT ON HIS OWN PURPOSE AND SO FULLY OCCUPIED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK BEFORE HIM THAT HE COULD HARDLY RECEIVE MISSUS DALE'S TIDINGS WITH ALL THE INTEREST WHICH THEY DESERVED UNPACK THEM ALL AGAIN HE SAID
5867-48852-0033 THAT WILL BE VERY TROUBLESOME IS LILY WITH YOU MISSUS DALE YES SHE IS IN THE PARLOUR COME AND SEE HER SO HE FOLLOWED MISSUS DALE THROUGH THE HALL AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS LOVE
5867-48852-0034 HOW DO YOU DO JOHN HOW DO YOU DO LILY WE ALL KNOW THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH MEETINGS ARE COMMENCED EACH LONGED TO BE TENDER AND AFFECTIONATE TO THE OTHER
5867-48852-0035 BUT NEITHER KNEW HOW TO THROW ANY TENDERNESS INTO THIS FIRST GREETING SO YOU'RE STAYING AT THE MANOR HOUSE SAID LILY YES I'M STAYING THERE YOUR UNCLE AND BELL CAME YESTERDAY AFTERNOON HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT BELL SAID MISSUS DALE
5867-48852-0036 OH YES MARY TOLD ME I'M SO GLAD OF IT I ALWAYS LIKED DOCTOR CROFTS VERY MUCH I HAVE NOT CONGRATULATED HER BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS A SECRET BUT CROFTS WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND IF IT IS A SECRET HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT KEEPING IT
5867-48852-0037 I DON'T KNOW THAT I AM FOND OF SUCH SECRETS BUT AS SHE SAID THIS SHE THOUGHT OF CROSBIE'S ENGAGEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN TOLD TO EVERY ONE AND OF ITS CONSEQUENCES IS IT TO BE SOON HE ASKED WELL YES WE THINK SO
5867-48852-0038 OF COURSE NOTHING IS SETTLED IT WAS SUCH FUN SAID LILY JAMES WHO TOOK AT ANY RATE A YEAR OR TWO TO MAKE HIS PROPOSAL WANTED TO BE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY AFTERWARDS NO LILY NOT QUITE THAT WELL MAMMA IT WAS VERY NEARLY THAT
5867-48852-0039 I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I SHOULD SO MUCH LIKE FOR A BROTHER I'M VERY GLAD YOU LIKE HIM VERY GLAD I HOPE YOU'LL BE FRIENDS ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME LITTLE TENDERNESS IN THIS AS JOHN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF I'M SURE WE SHALL IF HE LIKES IT THAT IS IF I EVER HAPPEN TO SEE HIM
5867-48852-0040 I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR HIM I CAN IF HE EVER COMES UP TO LONDON WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD THING MISSUS DALE IF HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN LONDON NO JOHN IT WOULD BE A VERY BAD THING WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER MISSUS DALE WAS SPEAKING OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER
5867-48852-0041 BUT THE VERY ALLUSION TO ANY SUCH ROBBERY COVERED JOHN EAMES'S FACE WITH A BLUSH
5867-48852-0042 AND FOR THE MOMENT SILENCED HIM YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE A BETTER CAREER IN LONDON SAID LILY SPEAKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER SUPERIOR PRESENCE OF MIND SHE HAD CERTAINLY SHOWN DEFECTIVE JUDGMENT IN DESIRING HER MOTHER NOT TO LEAVE THEM ALONE
5867-48852-0043 AND OF THIS MISSUS DALE SOON FELT HERSELF AWARE THE THING HAD TO BE DONE AND NO LITTLE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE SUCH AS THIS OF MISSUS DALE'S ENFORCED PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT IT OF THIS MISSUS DALE WAS WELL AWARE
5867-48852-0044 AND SHE FELT MOREOVER THAT JOHN WAS ENTITLED TO AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE
5867-48852-0045 BUT NOT THE LESS SHOULD HE HAVE IT OF RIGHT SEEING THAT HE DESIRED IT BUT YET MISSUS DALE DID NOT DARE TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM LILY HAD ASKED HER NOT TO DO SO AND AT THE PRESENT PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES ALL LILY'S REQUESTS WERE SACRED
5867-48852-0046 THEY CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME TO TALK OF CROFTS AND HIS MARRIAGE AND WHEN THAT SUBJECT WAS FINISHED THEY DISCUSSED THEIR OWN PROBABLE OR AS IT SEEMED NOW IMPROBABLE REMOVAL TO GUESTWICK IT'S GOING TOO FAR MAMMA SAID LILY
5867-48852-0047 TO SAY THAT YOU THINK WE SHALL NOT GO IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT THAT YOU SUGGESTED IT THE TRUTH IS JOHN THAT HOPKINS CAME IN AND DISCOURSED WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL ELOQUENCE NOBODY DARED TO OPPOSE HOPKINS HE MADE US ALMOST CRY HE WAS SO PATHETIC
5867-48852-0048 HE HAS JUST BEEN TALKING TO ME TOO SAID JOHN AS I CAME THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S GARDEN AND WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING TO YOU SAID MISSUS DALE OH I DON'T KNOW NOT MUCH
5867-48852-0049 JOHN HOWEVER REMEMBERED WELL AT THIS MOMENT ALL THAT THE GARDENER HAD SAID TO HIM DID SHE KNOW OF THAT ENCOUNTER BETWEEN HIM AND CROSBIE AND IF SHE DID KNOW OF IT IN WHAT LIGHT DID SHE REGARD IT
5867-48852-0050 HE HAD SWORN TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE THE SMALL HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING LILY TO BE HIS WIFE IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH HE WOULD BE GUILTY OF FALSEHOOD TOWARDS THE EARL IF HE DID SO LORD DE GUEST HAD OPENED HIS HOUSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0051 AND HAD ASKED ALL THE DALES THERE AND HAD OFFERED HIMSELF UP AS A SACRIFICE AT THE CRUEL SHRINE OF A SERIOUS DINNER PARTY TO SAY NOTHING OF THAT EASIER AND LIGHTER SACRIFICE WHICH HE HAD MADE IN A PECUNIARY POINT OF VIEW IN ORDER THAT THIS THING MIGHT BE DONE
5867-48852-0052 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES EAMES WAS TOO HONEST A MAN NOT TO DO IT LET THE DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY BE WHAT THEY MIGHT HE HAD SAT THERE FOR AN HOUR AND MISSUS DALE STILL REMAINED WITH HER DAUGHTER
5867-48852-0053 SHOULD HE GET UP BOLDLY AND ASK LILY TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HE ROSE AND GRASPED AT HIS HAT I AM GOING TO WALK BACK TO GUESTWICK SAID HE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME SO FAR TO SEE US
5867-48852-0054 I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF WALKING HE SAID
5867-48852-0055 HAVE A GLASS OF WINE BEFORE YOU GO OH DEAR NO I THINK I'LL GO BACK THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S FIELDS AND OUT ON THE ROAD AT THE WHITE GATE THE PATH IS QUITE DRY NOW I DARE SAY IT IS SAID MISSUS DALE LILY
5867-48852-0056 I WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD COME AS FAR AS THAT WITH ME AS THE REQUEST WAS MADE MISSUS DALE LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER ALMOST BESEECHINGLY DO PRAY DO SAID HE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR WALKING
5867-48852-0057 THE PATH PROPOSED LAY RIGHT ACROSS THE FIELD INTO WHICH LILY HAD TAKEN CROSBIE WHEN SHE MADE HER OFFER TO LET HIM OFF FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD EVER WALK THERE AGAIN WITH ANOTHER LOVER NO JOHN SHE SAID NOT TO DAY
5867-48852-0058 I THINK I AM ALMOST TIRED AND I HAD RATHER NOT GO OUT IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD SAID MISSUS DALE I DON'T WANT TO BE DONE GOOD TO MAMMA BESIDES I SHOULD HAVE TO COME BACK BY MYSELF I'LL COME BACK WITH YOU SAID JOHNNY
5867-48852-0059 OH YES AND THEN I SHOULD HAVE TO GO AGAIN WITH YOU BUT JOHN REALLY I DON'T WISH TO WALK TO DAY WHEREUPON JOHN EAMES AGAIN PUT DOWN HIS HAT LILY SAID HE AND THEN HE STOPPED MISSUS DALE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
5867-48852-0060 LILY I HAVE COME OVER HERE ON PURPOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU INDEED I HAVE COME DOWN FROM LONDON ONLY THAT I MIGHT SEE YOU HAVE YOU JOHN YES I HAVE YOU KNOW WELL ALL THAT I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU

5867-48852-0064 DEAR JOHN I WILL DO ANYTHING EVERYTHING FOR YOU BUT THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING SAID HE STILL HOLDING HER BY THE HAND BUT WITH HIS FACE TURNED FROM HER NAY DO NOT SAY SO
5867-48852-0065 I COULD NOT HAVE THAT ONE THING AND I WAS NEARER TO MY HEART'S LONGINGS THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN I CANNOT HAVE THAT ONE THING BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE BROKEN HEARTED
5867-48852-0066 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AM HE SAID NOT STRONGER BUT MORE CERTAIN MAKE YOURSELF AS SURE AS I AM AND YOU TOO WILL BE STRONG IS IT NOT SO MAMMA
5867-48852-0067 I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE IF YOU CAN GIVE HIM ANY HOPE MAMMA TELL ME THAT I MAY COME AGAIN IN A YEAR HE PLEADED I CANNOT TELL YOU SO YOU MAY NOT COME AGAIN NOT IN THIS WAY
5867-48852-0068 THAT I LOVED HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES IT IS STILL THE SAME I STILL LOVE HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD HOW THEN CAN I GIVE YOU ANY HOPE
5867-48852-0069 BUT IT WILL NOT BE SO FOR EVER LILY FOR EVER WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE MINE AS WELL AS HERS WHEN THAT FOR EVER COMES JOHN IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO LOVE
5867-48852-0070 YOU WILL SAY NOTHING MORE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU MORE OPENLY ABOUT THIS THAN I HAVE EVER DONE TO ANYBODY EVEN TO MAMMA BECAUSE I HAVE WISHED TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS
5867-48852-0071 I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN AFTER AFTER IT IS TO ME ALMOST AS THOUGH I HAD MARRIED HIM
5867-48852-0072 I AM NOT BLAMING HIM REMEMBER THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WITH A MAN SHE HAD NOT DROPPED HIS HAND AND AS SHE MADE HER LAST SPEECH WAS SITTING IN HER OLD CHAIR WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND
5867-48852-0073 SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY ALMOST WITH DIFFICULTY BUT STILL THE WORDS CAME VERY CLEARLY WITH A CLEAR DISTINCT VOICE WHICH CAUSED THEM TO BE REMEMBERED WITH ACCURACY
5867-48852-0074 TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE HIS SUIT AFTER SUCH A DECLARATION TO MISSUS DALE THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS SPEAKING OF A PERPETUAL WIDOWHOOD
5867-48852-0075 AND TELLING OF AN AMOUNT OF SUFFERING GREATER EVEN THAN THAT WHICH SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
5867-48852-0076 OR HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SO CLEAR AN EXPOSITION OF HER OWN FEELINGS I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS BUT VERY EASY TO BE UNDERSTOOD
5867-48852-0077 MISSUS DALE HAD FELT FROM THE FIRST THAT EAMES WAS COMING TOO SOON THAT THE EARL AND THE SQUIRE TOGETHER WERE MAKING AN EFFORT TO CURE THE WOUND TOO QUICKLY AFTER ITS INFLICTION THAT TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO HER GIRL TO RECOVER
5867-48852-0078 BUT NOW THE ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE AND WORDS HAD BEEN FORCED FROM LILY'S LIPS THE SPEAKING OF WHICH WOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY HERSELF I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO SAID JOHN AH YES
5867-48852-0079 YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE YOUR HEART UNDERSTANDS MY HEART AND YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME AND SAY NAUGHTY CRUEL WORDS AS YOU DID ONCE BEFORE WE WILL THINK OF EACH OTHER JOHN AND PRAY FOR EACH OTHER AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE ONE ANOTHER
5867-48852-0080 WHEN WE DO MEET LET US BE GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER NO OTHER FRIEND SHALL EVER BE DEARER TO ME THAN YOU ARE YOU ARE SO TRUE AND HONEST WHEN YOU MARRY I WILL TELL YOUR WIFE WHAT AN INFINITE BLESSING GOD HAS GIVEN HER
5867-48852-0081 YOU SHALL NEVER DO THAT YES I WILL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YET I WILL GOOD BY MISSUS DALE HE SAID GOOD BY JOHN
5867-48852-0082 AND I WILL LOVE YOU NOW THEN SHE PUT UP HER LIPS AND KISSED HIS FACE AND SO WILL I LOVE YOU SAID LILY GIVING HIM HER HAND AGAIN
5867-48852-0083 HE LOOKED LONGINGLY INTO HER FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE ALSO MIGHT KISS HIM THEN HE PRESSED HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND WITHOUT SPEAKING ANY FURTHER FAREWELL TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEFT THE ROOM POOR FELLOW
5867-48852-0084 SAID MISSUS DALE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE LET HIM COME SAID LILY BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
5867-48852-0085 AND THEY MEAN TO BE GOOD NATURED AND TO GIVE ME ANOTHER VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT LILY WENT AWAY BY HERSELF AND SAT ALONE FOR HOURS AND WHEN SHE JOINED HER MOTHER AGAIN AT TEA TIME NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID OF JOHN EAMES'S VISIT
5867-48852-0086 HE MADE HIS WAY OUT BY THE FRONT DOOR AND THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD AND IN THIS WAY ON TO THE FIELD THROUGH WHICH HE HAD ASKED LILY TO WALK WITH HIM
5867-48852-0087 AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE TOMBSTONES HE PAUSED AND READ ONE AS THOUGH IT INTERESTED HIM
5867-48852-0088 AND THEN PULLED OUT HIS OWN WATCH AS THOUGH TO VERIFY THE ONE BY THE OTHER HE MADE UNCONSCIOUSLY A STRUGGLE TO DRIVE AWAY FROM HIS THOUGHTS THE FACTS OF THE LATE SCENE AND FOR SOME FIVE OR TEN MINUTES HE SUCCEEDED
5867-48852-0089 AND LAUGHED INWARDLY AS HE REMEMBERED THE FIGURE OF RAFFERTY BRINGING IN THE KNIGHT'S SHOES HE HAD GONE SOME HALF MILE UPON HIS WAY BEFORE HE VENTURED TO STAND STILL AND TELL HIMSELF THAT HE HAD FAILED IN THE GREAT OBJECT OF HIS LIFE YES
5867-48852-0090 HE HAD FAILED AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF WITH BITTER REPROACHES THAT HE HAD FAILED NOW AND FOR EVER HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE HAD OBTRUDED UPON HER IN HER SORROW WITH AN UNMANNERLY LOVE
5867-48852-0091 AND REBUKED HIMSELF AS HAVING BEEN NOT ONLY FOOLISH BUT UNGENEROUS HIS FRIEND THE EARL HAD BEEN WONT IN HIS WAGGISH WAY TO CALL HIM THE CONQUERING HERO AND HAD SO TALKED HIM OUT OF HIS COMMON SENSE AS TO HAVE MADE HIM ALMOST THINK THAT HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN HIS SUIT
5867-48852-0092 HE ALMOST HATED THE EARL FOR HAVING BROUGHT HIM TO THIS CONDITION A CONQUERING HERO INDEED HOW SHOULD HE MANAGE TO SNEAK BACK AMONG THEM ALL AT THE MANOR HOUSE CRESTFALLEN AND ABJECT IN HIS MISERY
5867-48852-0093 EVERYBODY KNEW THE ERRAND ON WHICH HE HAD GONE AND EVERYBODY MUST KNOW OF HIS FAILURE HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL AS TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A TASK UNDER THE EYES OF SO MANY LOOKERS ON
5867-48852-0094 WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT HE HAD SO FONDLY EXPECTED SUCCESS AS TO THINK ONLY OF HIS TRIUMPH IN RETURNING AND NOT OF HIS MORE PROBABLE DISGRACE HE HAD ALLOWED OTHERS TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM
5867-48852-0095 AND HAD SO MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF THAT NOW ALL HOPE AND HAPPINESS WERE OVER FOR HIM HOW COULD HE ESCAPE AT ONCE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BACK TO LONDON HOW COULD HE GET AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD FURTHER TO ANY ONE
5867-48852-0096 HE CROSSED THE ROAD AT THE END OF THE SQUIRE'S PROPERTY WHERE THE PARISH OF ALLINGTON DIVIDES ITSELF FROM THAT OF ABBOT'S GUEST IN WHICH THE EARL'S HOUSE STANDS AND MADE HIS WAY BACK ALONG THE COPSE WHICH SKIRTED THE FIELD IN WHICH THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE BULL
5867-48852-0097 AH YES IT HAD BEEN WELL FOR HIM THAT HE HAD NOT COME OUT ON HORSEBACK THAT RIDE HOME ALONG THE HIGH ROAD AND UP TO THE MANOR HOUSE STABLES WOULD UNDER HIS PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM
5867-48852-0098 AS IT WAS HE DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO HIS PLACE IN THE EARL'S HOUSE HOW COULD HE PRETEND TO MAINTAIN HIS ORDINARY DEMEANOUR UNDER THE EYES OF THOSE TWO OLD MEN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GET HOME TO HIS MOTHER
5867-48852-0099 TO SEND A MESSAGE FROM THENCE TO THE MANOR AND THEN TO ESCAPE BACK TO LONDON SO THINKING BUT WITH NO RESOLUTION MADE HE WENT ON THROUGH THE WOODS
5867-48852-0100 THERE HE STOPPED AND STOOD A WHILE WITH HIS BROAD HAND SPREAD OVER THE LETTERS WHICH HE HAD CUT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS SO AS TO HIDE THEM FROM HIS SIGHT WHAT AN ASS I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS AND EVER HE SAID TO HIMSELF
5867-48852-0101 IT WAS NOT ONLY OF HIS LATE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HE WAS THINKING BUT OF HIS WHOLE PAST LIFE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS HOBBLEDEHOYHOOD
5867-48852-0102 OF THAT BACKWARDNESS ON HIS PART IN ASSUMING MANHOOD WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM INCAPABLE OF MAKING HIMSELF ACCEPTABLE TO LILY BEFORE SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF CROSBIE
5867-48852-0103 IF SUCH SENDING MIGHT POSSIBLY BE DONE BY FAIR BEATING REGARDLESS WHETHER HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO FOLLOW HIM WAS IT NOT HARD THAT FOR THE TWO OF THEM FOR LILY AND FOR HIM ALSO
5867-48852-0104 THERE SHOULD BE SUCH PUNISHMENT BECAUSE OF THE INSINCERITY OF THAT MAN WHEN HE HAD THUS STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND WITH DEEP ROUGH GASHES IN THE WOOD CUT OUT LILY'S NAME FROM THE RAIL
5867-48852-0105 HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED AND WAS STILL LOOKING AT THE CHIPS AS THEY WERE BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE STREAM WHEN A GENTLE STEP CAME CLOSE UP TO HIM AND TURNING ROUND HE SAW THAT LADY JULIA WAS ON THE BRIDGE SHE WAS CLOSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0106 AND HAD ALREADY SEEN HIS HANDIWORK HAS SHE OFFENDED YOU JOHN SHE SAID
5867-48852-0107 DO YOU MEAN TO CUT IT OUT FROM YOUR HEART NEVER I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I NEVER SHALL KEEP TO IT AS TO A GREAT TREASURE IT WILL BE A JOY TO YOU IN AFTER YEARS AND NOT A SORROW
5867-48852-0108 WILL BE A CONSOLATION WHEN YOU ARE AS OLD AS I AM IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE HAD A HEART
5867-48852-0109 AND JOHN I CAN UNDERSTAND HER FEELING NOW AND INDEED I THOUGHT ALL THROUGH THAT YOU WERE ASKING HER TOO SOON BUT THE TIME MAY YET COME WHEN SHE WILL THINK BETTER OF YOUR WISHES NO NO NEVER I BEGIN TO KNOW HER NOW
5867-48852-0110 IF YOU CAN BE CONSTANT IN YOUR LOVE YOU MAY WIN HER YET REMEMBER HOW YOUNG SHE IS AND HOW YOUNG YOU BOTH ARE COME AGAIN IN TWO YEARS TIME AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE WON HER YOU SHALL TELL ME THAT I HAVE BEEN A GOOD OLD WOMAN TO YOU BOTH
5867-48852-0111 I SHALL NEVER WIN HER LADY JULIA AS HE SPOKE THESE LAST WORDS THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
5867-48852-0112 IT WAS WELL FOR HIM THAT SHE HAD COME UPON HIM IN HIS SORROW WHEN HE ONCE KNEW THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIS TEARS
1898-145724-0000 TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND AN OLD WOMAN WHO BEGGED HIM TO HELP HER OUT OF THE DITCH THE PRINCE BENT DOWN AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HER LIVING GRAVE ASKING HER AT THE SAME TIME HOW SHE HAD MANAGED TO GET THERE MY SON
1898-145724-0001 ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN I AM A VERY POOR WOMAN AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT I SET OUT FOR THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN IN ORDER TO SELL MY EGGS IN THE MARKET ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING BUT I LOST MY WAY IN THE DARK
1898-145724-0002 OVER THERE AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST IN THE LITTLE HUT YOU SEE IN THE DISTANCE REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN THE PRINCE LIFTED HER ON TO HIS HORSE AND SOON THEY REACHED THE HUT WHERE THE OLD WOMAN GOT DOWN AND TURNING TO THE PRINCE SAID
1898-145724-0003 JUST WAIT A MOMENT AND I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING AND SHE DISAPPEARED INTO HER HUT BUT RETURNED VERY SOON AND SAID YOU ARE A MIGHTY PRINCE BUT AT THE SAME
1898-145724-0004 WHICH DESERVES TO BE REWARDED WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR WIFE MOST CERTAINLY I WOULD REPLIED THE PRINCE SO THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED
1898-145724-0005 WHO HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY A DRAGON IF YOU WISH TO MARRY HER YOU MUST FIRST SET HER FREE AND THIS I WILL HELP YOU TO DO I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BELL IF YOU RING IT ONCE
1898-145724-0006 THE KING OF THE EAGLES WILL APPEAR IF YOU RING IT TWICE THE KING OF THE FOXES WILL COME TO YOU AND IF YOU RING IT THREE TIMES YOU WILL SEE THE KING OF THE FISHES BY YOUR SIDE
1898-145724-0007 AND INTENDED SETTING OUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY INTO THE WIDE WORLD IN SEARCH OF THE MAID SO THE NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE MOUNTED HIS FINE HORSE AND LEFT HIS HOME
1898-145724-0008 AND HIS HORSE HAD DIED OF EXHAUSTION WHILE HE HIMSELF HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM WANT AND MISERY BUT STILL HE HAD COME ON NO TRACE OF HER HE WAS IN SEARCH OF AT LAST ONE DAY HE CAME TO A HUT IN FRONT OF WHICH SAT A VERY OLD MAN
1898-145724-0009 NO I DO NOT ANSWERED THE OLD MAN
1898-145724-0010 THE PRINCE THANKED HIM FOR HIS INFORMATION AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY FOR A WHOLE YEAR ALONG THE SAME ROAD AND AT THE END OF IT CAME TO THE LITTLE HUT WHERE HE FOUND A VERY OLD MAN
1898-145724-0011 HE ASKED HIM THE SAME QUESTION AND THE OLD MAN ANSWERED NO
1898-145724-0012 WITH DIAMOND WINDOWS HE OPENED THE BIG GATE LEADING INTO THE COURTYARD
1898-145724-0013 WHEN SEVEN DRAGONS RUSHED ON HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED THE PRINCE REPLIED
1898-145724-0014 WOULD LIKE TO ENTER HER SERVICE THIS FLATTERING SPEECH PLEASED THE DRAGONS AND THE ELDEST OF THEM SAID WELL YOU MAY COME WITH ME AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE MOTHER DRAGON
1898-145724-0015 THEY ENTERED THE CASTLE AND WALKED THROUGH TWELVE SPLENDID HALLS ALL MADE OF GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE TWELFTH ROOM THEY FOUND THE MOTHER DRAGON SEATED ON A DIAMOND THRONE SHE WAS THE
1898-145724-0016 AND ADDED TO IT ALL SHE HAD THREE HEADS HER APPEARANCE WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO THE PRINCE AND SO WAS HER VOICE WHICH WAS LIKE THE CROAKING OF MANY RAVENS SHE ASKED HIM
1898-145724-0017 VERY WELL
1898-145724-0018 WE WILL EAT YOU UP THE PRINCE UNDERTOOK THE TASK AND LED THE MARE OUT TO THE MEADOW
1898-145724-0019 AND AT LAST IN DESPAIR SAT DOWN ON A BIG STONE AND CONTEMPLATED HIS SAD FATE AS HE SAT THUS LOST IN THOUGHT HE NOTICED AN EAGLE FLYING OVER HIS HEAD THEN HE SUDDENLY BETHOUGHT HIM OF HIS LITTLE BELL
1898-145724-0020 AND TAKING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET HE RANG IT ONCE IN A MOMENT HE HEARD A RUSTLING SOUND IN THE AIR BESIDE HIM AND THE KING OF THE EAGLES SANK AT HIS FEET
1898-145724-0021 THE BIRD SAID YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE WHO IS GALLOPING ABOUT AMONG THE CLOUDS I WILL SUMMON ALL THE EAGLES OF THE AIR TOGETHER AND ORDER THEM TO CATCH THE MARE AND BRING HER TO YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS THE KING OF THE EAGLES FLEW AWAY
1898-145724-0022 TOWARDS EVENING THE PRINCE HEARD A MIGHTY RUSHING SOUND IN THE AIR AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE SAW THOUSANDS OF EAGLES DRIVING THE MARE BEFORE THEM THEY SANK AT HIS FEET ON TO THE GROUND AND GAVE THE MARE OVER TO HIM THEN THE PRINCE RODE HOME TO THE OLD MOTHER DRAGON
1898-145724-0023 WHO WAS FULL OF WONDER WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND SAID
1898-145724-0024 SHE GAVE HIM AT THE SAME TIME A CLOAK MADE OF COPPER
1898-145724-0025 HERE TOO WAS THE FLOWER QUEEN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER HER DRESS WAS WOVEN OUT OF THE MOST LOVELY FLOWERS IN THE WORLD AND HER COMPLEXION WAS LIKE LILIES AND ROSES AS THE PRINCE WAS DANCING WITH HER HE MANAGED TO WHISPER IN HER EAR
1898-145724-0026 THE BALL CAME TO AN END AT MIDNIGHT AND EARLY NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE AGAIN LED THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE OUT INTO THE MEADOW BUT AGAIN SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT TWICE
1898-145724-0027 AND AGAIN SHE LED HIM TO THE BALL ROOM THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM SAFE AND SOUND AND WHEN THEY WERE DANCING TOGETHER SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR IF YOU SUCCEED AGAIN TO MORROW WAIT FOR ME WITH THE FOAL IN THE MEADOW
1898-145724-0028 AFTER THE BALL WE WILL FLY AWAY TOGETHER ON THE THIRD DAY THE PRINCE LED THE MARE TO THE MEADOW AGAIN BUT ONCE MORE SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT THREE TIMES
1898-145724-0029 IN A MOMENT THE KING OF THE FISHES APPEARED AND SAID TO HIM I KNOW QUITE WELL WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO AND I WILL SUMMON ALL THE FISHES OF THE SEA TOGETHER
1898-145724-0030 SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE A BRAVE YOUTH AND I WILL MAKE YOU MY BODY SERVANT BUT WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU AS A REWARD TO BEGIN WITH
1898-145724-0031 THE PRINCE BEGGED FOR A FOAL OF THE MARE WHICH THE MOTHER DRAGON AT ONCE GAVE HIM AND OVER AND ABOVE A CLOAK MADE OF GOLD FOR SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD PRAISED HER BEAUTY SO IN THE EVENING HE APPEARED AT THE BALL IN HIS GOLDEN CLOAK
1898-145724-0032 THE PRINCE AND SHE FLEW LIKE THE WIND TILL THEY REACHED THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DWELLING BUT THE DRAGONS HAD NOTICED THEIR FLIGHT AND WOKE THEIR BROTHER OUT OF HIS YEAR'S SLEEP HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED
1898-145724-0033 AND DETERMINED TO LAY SIEGE TO THE FLOWER QUEEN'S PALACE BUT THE QUEEN CAUSED A FOREST OF FLOWERS AS HIGH AS THE SKY TO GROW UP ROUND HER DWELLING THROUGH WHICH NO ONE COULD FORCE A WAY
1898-145724-0034 WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN HEARD THAT HER DAUGHTER WANTED TO MARRY THE PRINCE SHE SAID TO HIM I WILL GIVE MY CONSENT TO YOUR MARRIAGE GLADLY BUT MY DAUGHTER CAN ONLY STAY WITH YOU IN SUMMER IN WINTER WHEN EVERYTHING IS DEAD AND THE GROUND COVERED WITH SNOW
1898-145724-0035 SHE MUST COME AND LIVE WITH ME IN MY PALACE UNDERGROUND THE PRINCE CONSENTED TO THIS AND LED HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE HOME WHERE THE WEDDING WAS HELD WITH GREAT POMP AND MAGNIFICENCE THE YOUNG COUPLE LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER TILL WINTER CAME
1898-145724-0036 WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER DEPARTED AND WENT HOME TO HER MOTHER
1898-145724-0037 AND LASTED TILL THE APPROACH OF WINTER WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER MOTHER
1898-145715-0000 ONCE THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD NO CHILDREN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE AT LENGTH HEAVEN GRANTED HIM A DAUGHTER OF SUCH REMARKABLE BEAUTY THAT HE COULD THINK OF NO NAME SO APPROPRIATE FOR HER AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY
1898-145715-0001 THAN THEY RESOLVED TO GAIN POSSESSION OF HER WHO BORE IT AND EITHER TO TORMENT HER CRUELLY OR AT LEAST TO CONCEAL HER FROM THE EYES OF ALL MEN THE ELDEST OF THEIR TRIBE WAS ENTRUSTED TO CARRY OUT THEIR REVENGE THIS FAIRY WAS NAMED LAGREE
1898-145715-0002 SHE WAS SO OLD THAT SHE ONLY HAD ONE EYE AND ONE TOOTH LEFT
1898-145715-0003 SHE WAS ALSO SO SPITEFUL THAT SHE GLADLY DEVOTED ALL HER TIME TO CARRYING OUT ALL THE MEAN OR ILL NATURED TRICKS OF THE WHOLE BODY OF FAIRIES WITH HER LARGE EXPERIENCE ADDED TO HER NATIVE SPITE
1898-145715-0004 SHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HER
1898-145715-0005 AT THE SAME TIME GIVING HER THE STRICTEST ORDERS NEVER TO LET OUT THE FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE SHE THEN GAVE TWO GLASS BOTTLES INTO THE PRINCESS'S CHARGE DESIRING HER TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEM
1898-145715-0006 AND HAVING ENFORCED HER ORDERS WITH THE MOST AWFUL THREATS IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE SHE VANISHED LEAVING THE LITTLE GIRL AT LIBERTY TO EXPLORE THE PALACE
1898-145715-0007 SEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING HER FATHER
1898-145715-0008 SHE NOTICED THAT THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRODUCE A BRILLIANT RAINBOW SHE STOOD STILL TO ADMIRE IT WHEN TO HER GREAT SURPRISE SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYS
1898-145715-0009 THE VOICE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN AND ITS SWEETNESS OF TONE AND THE AGREEABLE THINGS IT UTTERED LED ONE TO INFER THAT ITS OWNER MUST BE EQUALLY CHARMING BUT THIS HAD TO BE A MERE MATTER OF FANCY FOR NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
1898-145715-0010 THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW INFORMED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THAT HE WAS YOUNG THE SON OF A POWERFUL KING AND THAT THE FAIRY LAGREE WHO OWED HIS PARENTS A GRUDGE
1898-145715-0011 HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
1898-145715-0012 HE NO LONGER SIGHED FOR FREEDOM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND LEARNED TO LOVE FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HE ADDED MANY OTHER TENDER SPEECHES TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE PRINCESS TO WHOM SUCH REMARKS WERE A NEW EXPERIENCE
1898-145715-0013 COULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVES
1898-145715-0014 LAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONER
1898-145715-0015 FOR FIRE WITH WHICH TO RELIGHT THE ONE SHE HAD ALLOWED TO GO OUT NOW THIS LOCRINOS WAS A CRUEL MONSTER WHO DEVOURED EVERYONE HE CAME ACROSS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED A CHANCE OF CATCHING
1898-145715-0016 AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
1898-145715-0017 AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
1898-145715-0018 SHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERS
1898-145715-0019 SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
1898-145715-0020 CONVENIENT WAY OF MEETING THAN BY THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN AND FAIRER THAN A FAIRY CARRIED OUT HIS PLAN DAILY WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS EVERY MORNING SHE PLACED A LARGE BASIN FULL OF WATER ON HER WINDOW SILL AND AS SOON AS THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER
1898-145715-0021 THE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHT
1898-145715-0022 AND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GO
1898-145715-0023 THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
1898-145715-0024 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY EAGERLY RAN TO THE WINDOW BUT IN HER HASTE SHE UPSET THE BASIN AND SPILT ALL THE WATER WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY FILLED IT OVERNIGHT NO OTHER WATER WAS AT HAND EXCEPT THAT IN THE TWO BOTTLES
1898-145715-0025 IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
1898-145715-0026 THE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREE
1898-145715-0027 THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE VOWED TO HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND AND DECLARED HERSELF WILLING TO BRAVE DEATH ITSELF IN ORDER TO REJOIN HIM THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME FOR THEIR ADIEUS THE RAINBOW VANISHED AND THE PRINCESS RESOLVED TO RUN ALL RISKS
1898-145715-0028 STARTED OFF AT ONCE TAKING NOTHING WITH HER BUT HER DOG HER CAT A SPRIG OF MYRTLE AND THE STONE WHICH THE WIFE OF LOCRINOS GAVE HER WHEN LAGREE BECAME AWARE OF HER PRISONER'S FLIGHT
1898-145715-0029 AS SHE DID SO THE SPRIG OF MYRTLE SHE CARRIED TOUCHED THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY A GREEN AND SHADY BOWER SPRANG UP ROUND HER IN WHICH SHE HOPED TO SLEEP IN PEACE BUT LAGREE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HER PURSUIT
1898-145715-0030 AND ARRIVED JUST AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP THIS TIME SHE MADE SURE OF CATCHING HER VICTIM BUT THE CAT SPIED HER OUT
1898-145715-0031 SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
1898-145715-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
1898-145715-0033 WHICH STOOD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE HERE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY A BEAUTIFUL LADY DRESSED IN GREEN AND WHITE TO MATCH THE HOUSE WHICH APPARENTLY BELONGED TO HER AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED THE ONLY INHABITANT
1898-145715-0034 SHE GAVE HER A NUT DESIRING HER ONLY TO OPEN IT IN THE MOST URGENT NEED AFTER A LONG AND TIRING JOURNEY FAIRER THAN A FAIRY WAS ONCE MORE RECEIVED IN A HOUSE AND BY A LADY EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE SHE
1898-145715-0035 HERE AGAIN SHE RECEIVED A PRESENT WITH THE SAME INJUNCTIONS
1898-145715-0036 THAT THEY WISHED THEIR HOUSES AND GARMENTS TO BE EQUALLY ALIKE THEIR OCCUPATION CONSISTED IN HELPING THOSE IN MISFORTUNE AND THEY WERE AS GENTLE AND BENEVOLENT AS LAGREE HAD BEEN CRUEL AND SPITEFUL THE THIRD FAIRY COMFORTED THE POOR TRAVELLER
1898-145715-0037 BEGGED HER NOT TO LOSE HEART AND ASSURED HER THAT HER TROUBLES SHOULD BE REWARDED SHE ACCOMPANIED HER ADVICE BY THE GIFT OF A CRYSTAL SMELLING BOTTLE WITH STRICT ORDERS ONLY TO OPEN IT IN CASE OF URGENT NEED
1898-145715-0038 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THANKED HER WARMLY AND RESUMED HER WAY CHEERED BY PLEASANT THOUGHTS AFTER A TIME HER ROAD LED THROUGH A WOOD FULL OF SOFT AIRS AND SWEET ODOURS AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS SHE SAW A WONDERFUL SILVER CASTLE
1898-145715-0039 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
1898-145715-0040 THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTER
1898-145715-0041 YOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER IN
1898-145715-0042 SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
1898-145715-0043 WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
1898-145715-0044 ON OPENING IT FOUND THAT ALL THE SEEDS WERE AS MANY LITTLE VIOLINS WHICH FLEW UP IN THE VAULTED ROOF AND AT ONCE BEGAN PLAYING MELODIOUSLY
1898-145715-0045 THE PRINCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ROUSED BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOKED ALL THE HANDSOMER IMPATIENT AT NOT BEING RECOGNISED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY NOW DREW OUT HER THIRD PRESENT AND ON OPENING THE CRYSTAL SCENT BOTTLE A LITTLE SYREN FLEW OUT
1898-145715-0046 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WALLS OF THE ROOM EXPANDED AND OPENED OUT REVEALING A GOLDEN THRONE COVERED WITH JEWELS
1898-145715-0047 IN THE FIRST AND MOST SPLENDID OF THESE CARRIAGES SAT PRINCE RAINBOW'S MOTHER SHE FONDLY EMBRACED HER SON AFTER WHICH SHE INFORMED HIM THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SOME YEARS THAT THE ANGER OF THE FAIRIES WAS AT LENGTH APPEASED
1898-145715-0048 AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN IN PEACE TO REIGN OVER HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE LONGING FOR HIS PRESENCE THE COURT RECEIVED THE NEW KING WITH JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM AT ANY OTHER TIME
1898-145715-0049 HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MOTHER AND THE COURT
1898-145715-0050 CHARMS WOULD WIN ALL HEARTS WHEN THE THREE GREEN AND WHITE SISTERS APPEARED THEY DECLARED THE SECRET OF FAIRY THAN A FAIRY'S ROYAL BIRTH AND THE QUEEN TAKING THE TWO LOVERS IN HER CARRIAGE SET OFF WITH THEM FOR THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM
1898-145720-0000 FAR AWAY IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE THE RED INDIANS DWELL
1898-145720-0001 MANY OF THE YOUNG BRAVES SOUGHT HER IN MARRIAGE BUT SHE WOULD LISTEN TO ONE ONLY A HANDSOME CHIEF WHO HAD TAKEN HER FANCY SOME YEARS BEFORE SO THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND GREAT REJOICINGS WERE MADE
1898-145720-0002 BUT FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET HE SAT BY THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS LAID THINKING OF HIS HAPPINESS THAT WAS BURIED THERE AT LAST AFTER MANY DAYS A LIGHT SEEMED TO COME TO HIM OUT OF THE DARKNESS
1898-145720-0003 HE REMEMBERED HAVING HEARD FROM THE OLD OLD PEOPLE OF THE TRIBE THAT THERE WAS A PATH THAT LED TO THE LAND OF SOULS THAT IF YOU SOUGHT CAREFULLY YOU COULD FIND IT
1898-145720-0004 SO THE NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP EARLY AND PUT SOME FOOD IN HIS POUCH AND SLUNG AN EXTRA SKIN OVER HIS SHOULDERS FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG HIS JOURNEY WOULD TAKE NOR WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONLY ONE THING HE KNEW
1898-145720-0005 ONE OF THE OLD MEN SAY THAT THE LAND OF SOULS LAY TO THE SOUTH AND SO FILLED WITH NEW HOPE AND COURAGE HE SET HIS FACE SOUTHWARDS FOR MANY MANY MILES THE COUNTRY LOOKED THE SAME AS IT DID ROUND HIS OWN HOME
1898-145720-0006 BUT GREW LESS AND LESS THE FARTHER HE WENT SOUTH TILL IT DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER SOON THE TREES PUT FORTH THEIR BUDS AND FLOWERS SPRANG UP UNDER HIS FEET AND INSTEAD OF THICK CLOUDS THERE WAS BLUE SKY OVER HIS HEAD AND EVERYWHERE THE BIRDS WERE SINGING
1898-145720-0007 AND ON THE TOP OF THESE HE FOUND A HUT OR WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND HOLDING A STAFF IN HIS HAND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
1898-145720-0008 REST IN MY HUT AS SHE ALSO RESTED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU ASK AND WHITHER YOU SHOULD GO ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE HUT BUT HIS HEART WAS TOO EAGER WITHIN HIM
1898-145720-0009 TO SUFFER HIM TO REST AND WHEN HE AROSE THE OLD MAN ROSE TOO AND STOOD WITH HIM AT THE DOOR LOOK HE SAID
1898-145720-0010 AT THE WATER WHICH LIES FAR OUT YONDER AND THE PLAINS WHICH STRETCH BEYOND
1898-145720-0011 BUT NO MAN ENTERS IT WITHOUT LEAVING HIS BODY BEHIND HIM
1898-145720-0012 INSTEAD OF HIDING AS HE APPROACHED AND BIRDS CIRCLED ROUND HIM
1898-145720-0013 VERY SOON HE NOTICED WITH WONDER THAT NEITHER ROCKS NOR TREES BARRED HIS PATH HE PASSED THROUGH THEM WITHOUT KNOWING IT FOR INDEED THEY WERE NOT ROCKS AND TREES AT ALL BUT ONLY THE SOULS OF THEM FOR THIS WAS THE LAND OF SHADOWS
1898-145720-0014 WHEN TO HIS JOY AND WONDER HE SAW FOLLOWING HIM IN ANOTHER CANOE EXACTLY LIKE HIS OWN THE MAIDEN FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD MADE THIS LONG JOURNEY BUT THEY COULD NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER FOR BETWEEN THEM ROLLED GREAT WAVES WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY WOULD SINK THE BOATS
1898-145720-0015 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAD NO FEAR AND REACHED THE OTHER SIDE IN SAFETY STILL THOUGH THE CHIEF AND THE YOUNG GIRL QUAILED IN TERROR AT THESE HORRIBLE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS NO HARM CAME TO THEM FOR THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN FREE FROM EVIL
1898-145720-0016 SO THEY REACHED UNHURT THE SHORE OF THE HAPPY ISLAND AND WANDERED THROUGH THE FLOWERY FIELDS AND BY THE BANKS OF RUSHING STREAMS AND THEY KNEW NOT HUNGER NOR THIRST NEITHER COLD NOR HEAT
1898-145720-0017 BUT IN THE MURMUR OF THE WIND HE HEARD THE MASTER OF LIFE SAYING TO HIM RETURN WHITHER YOU CAME FOR I HAVE WORK FOR YOU TO DO AND YOUR PEOPLE NEED YOU AND FOR MANY YEARS YOU SHALL RULE OVER THEM
1898-145720-0018 AT THE GATE MY MESSENGER AWAITS YOU AND YOU SHALL TAKE AGAIN
254-145458-0000 IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
254-145458-0001 INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
254-145458-0002 ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
254-145458-0003 IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
254-145458-0004 MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
254-145458-0005 LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
254-145458-0006 SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
254-145458-0007 WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
254-145458-0008 TO US MANY OTHERS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT TOO FOR WE WERE SO DOMESTIC HE SO TERRIFYINGLY COSMOPOLITAN WHILE WE WERE BEING FUNNY AS PLANNED WITH COLLAR STUDS AND HOT WATER BOTTLES
254-145458-0009 IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
254-145458-0010 OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
254-145458-0011 LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
254-145458-0012 IF HIS INSENSITIVENESS CARRIED HIM THROUGH AT TIMES TO VICTORY IT BROUGHT HIM AT TIMES TO DEFEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS THAT MASTERY OF THE CONTE IN THIS BOOK AT LEAST
254-145458-0013 WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
254-145458-0014 WHICH WAS NOT IN THE BOYISH SAKI'S EQUIPMENT HE LEAVES LOOSE ENDS EVERYWHERE NOR IN HIS DIALOGUE DELIGHTFUL AS IT OFTEN IS FUNNY AS IT NEARLY ALWAYS IS IS HE THE SUPREME MASTER
254-145458-0015 TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
254-145458-0016 HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
254-145458-0017 LET US TAKE A SAMPLE OR TWO OF SAKI NINETEEN ELEVEN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DINNER HAD WORN OFF THE WINE LISTS HAD BEEN CONSULTED
254-145458-0018 LOCATE IS THE PLEASANT WORD HERE STILL MORE SATISFYING IN THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS TATTOOED FROM COLLAR BONE TO WAIST LINE WITH A GLOWING REPRESENTATION OF THE FALL OF ICARUS
254-145458-0019 IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
254-145458-0020 BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
254-145458-0021 AND MISSUS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER SEEM TO ME TO BE THE MASTERPIECES OF THIS BOOK IN BOTH OF THEM CLOVIS EXERCISES NEEDLESSLY HIS TITULAR RIGHT OF ENTRY BUT HE CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGE
254-27760-0000 WHO HAD BEEN APPRENTICE TO THE SHOEMAKER ALIAKHIN FOR THREE MONTHS DID NOT GO TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
254-27760-0001 HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
254-27760-0002 THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
254-27760-0003 HE WROTE I AM WRITING YOU A LETTER

254-27760-0006 HOW TO SNEAK UP AND TAKE A BITE AT A LEG OR SLIP INTO THE LARDER
254-27760-0007 MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAD NEARLY BROKEN HIS HIND LEGS TWICE HE HAD BEEN HUNG UP EVERY WEEK HE WAS NEARLY FLOGGED TO DEATH BUT HE ALWAYS RECOVERED AT THIS MOMENT FOR CERTAIN
254-27760-0008 HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
254-27760-0009 HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
254-27760-0010 NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
254-27760-0011 THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
254-27760-0012 MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE
254-27760-0013 I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING

254-27760-0018 THE CORNERS OF VANKA'S MOUTH WENT DOWN HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITH HIS DIRTY FIST AND SOBBED I'LL GRATE YOUR TOBACCO FOR YOU HE CONTINUED I'LL PRAY TO GOD FOR YOU

254-27760-0023 ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
254-27760-0024 TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
254-27760-0025 HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
254-27760-0026 VANKA DID THE SAME THEN BEFORE CUTTING DOWN THE CHRISTMAS TREE HIS GRANDFATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE TOOK A LONG PINCH OF SNUFF AND MADE FUN OF POOR FROZEN LITTLE VANKA
254-27760-0027 THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
254-27760-0028 SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND
254-27760-0029 BUSIED HERSELF MOST ABOUT IT WHEN LITTLE VANKA'S MOTHER PELAGUEYA WAS STILL ALIVE AND WAS SERVANT WOMAN IN THE HOUSE OLGA IGNATYEVNA USED TO STUFF HIM WITH SUGAR CANDY AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO

254-27760-0033 FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
254-27760-0034 AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
254-127705-0000 THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
254-127705-0001 WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
254-127705-0002 INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED BUT IF THEY DID NOT COME IN HE WOULD MAKE WAR UPON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL
254-127705-0003 INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
254-127705-0004 TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
254-127705-0005 MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
254-127705-0006 MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
254-127705-0007 AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
254-127705-0008 TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
254-127705-0009 IT WAS YOUR PEOPLE WHO ROBBED MY STORES BURNED MY HOUSES AND MURDERED MY MEN IT THEY DO NOT MAKE A TREATY YOUR WHOLE TRIBE WILL BE DESTROYED NOT ONE OF THEM WILL BE LEFT ALIVE TO THIS THE OLD CHIEF REPLIED
254-127705-0010 IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
254-127705-0011 THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
254-127705-0012 AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
254-127705-0013 AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
254-127705-0014 SAVAGE TOLD TENAYA THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
254-127705-0015 TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
254-127705-0016 MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
254-127705-0017 BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
254-127705-0018 BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
254-127705-0019 AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
254-127705-0020 POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
254-127705-0021 ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
254-127705-0022 MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
254-127705-0023 A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
254-127705-0024 SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
254-127705-0025 THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
254-127705-0026 THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
254-127705-0027 BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
254-127705-0028 AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
254-127705-0029 BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
254-127705-0030 THIS LED TO ANOTHER YOSEMITE EXPEDITION A DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE U S A WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
254-127705-0031 WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
254-127705-0032 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
254-127705-0033 THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM
254-127705-0034 THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
254-127705-0035 BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON

6000-86686-0011 SAYS HE AS TO REPAIR YOUR OLD GOOSE FOR NOTHING WHAT'LL YOU GI ME IF I DO THE JOB FOR YOU THAT'S THE CHAT SAYS SAINT KAVIN I'LL GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU ASK SAYS THE KING ISN'T THAT FAIR
6000-86686-0012 SAYS THE SAINT THAT'S THE WAY TO DO BUSINESS NOW
6000-86686-0013 THIS IS THE BARGAIN I'LL MAKE WITH YOU KING O'TOOLE WILL YOU GI ME ALL THE GROUND THE GOOSE FLIES OVER THE FIRST OFFER AFTER I MAKE HER AS GOOD AS NEW I WILL SAYS THE KING YOU WON'T GO BACK O YOUR WORD SAYS SAINT KAVIN
6000-86686-0014 HONOUR BRIGHT SAYS KING O'TOOLE HOLDING OUT HIS FIST HONOUR BRIGHT SAYS SAINT KAVIN BACK AGAIN IT'S A BARGAIN COME HERE SAYS HE TO THE POOR OLD GOOSE
6000-86686-0015 AND IT'S I THAT'LL MAKE YOU THE SPORTING BIRD WITH THAT MY DEAR HE TOOK UP THE GOOSE BY THE TWO WINGS
6000-86686-0016 AND THROWING HER UP IN THE AIR WHEW SAYS HE JIST GIVIN HER A BLAST TO HELP HER AND WITH THAT MY JEWEL SHE TOOK TO HER HEELS FLYIN LIKE ONE O THE EAGLES THEMSELVES AND CUTTING AS MANY CAPERS AS A SWALLOW BEFORE A SHOWER OF RAIN
6000-86686-0017 LOOKING AT HIS POOR OLD GOOSE FLYING AS LIGHT AS A LARK AND BETTER THAN EVER SHE WAS
6000-86686-0018 SAYS SAINT KAVIN FOR MAKING HER THE LIKE BY JABERS SAYS THE KING I SAY NOTHING BEATS THE ART O MAN BARRING THE BEES AND DO YOU SAY NO MORE NOR THAT SAYS SAINT KAVIN AND THAT I'M BEHOLDEN TO YOU SAYS THE KING
6000-86686-0019 I WILL SAYS KING O'TOOLE AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT SAYS HE THOUGH IT'S THE LAST ACRE I HAVE TO GIVE BUT YOU'LL KEEP YOUR WORD TRUE SAYS THE SAINT AS TRUE AS THE SUN SAYS THE KING IT'S WELL FOR YOU KING O'TOOLE THAT YOU SAID THAT WORD SAYS HE
6000-86686-0020 WHEN THE KING WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD SAINT KAVIN WAS PLEASED WITH HIM AND THEN IT WAS THAT HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO THE KING AND SAYS HE KING O'TOOLE YOU'RE A DECENT MAN FOR I ONLY CAME HERE TO TRY YOU YOU DON'T KNOW ME SAYS HE BECAUSE I'M DISGUISED MUSHA
6000-86686-0021 THEN SAYS THE KING WHO ARE YOU I'M SAINT KAVIN SAID THE SAINT BLESSING HIMSELF OH QUEEN OF HEAVEN SAYS THE KING MAKING THE SIGN OF THE CROSS BETWEEN HIS EYES AND FALLING DOWN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE SAINT IS IT THE GREAT SAINT KAVIN SAYS HE
6000-86686-0022 THAT I'VE BEEN DISCOURSING ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT KNOWING IT SAYS HE
6000-86686-0023 AND SO YOU'RE A SAINT SAYS THE KING I AM SAYS SAINT KAVIN BY JABERS I THOUGHT I WAS ONLY TALKING TO A DACENT BOY SAYS THE KING WELL YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE NOW SAYS THE SAINT I'M SAINT KAVIN SAYS HE THE GREATEST OF ALL THE SAINTS
6000-86686-0024 AND SO THE KING HAD HIS GOOSE AS GOOD AS NEW TO DIVERT HIM AS LONG AS HE LIVED AND THE SAINT SUPPORTED HIM AFTER HE CAME INTO HIS PROPERTY AS I TOLD YOU UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH AND THAT WAS SOON AFTER FOR THE POOR GOOSE THOUGHT HE WAS CATCHING A TROUT ONE FRIDAY
6000-86686-0025 BUT MY JEWEL IT WAS A MISTAKE HE MADE AND INSTEAD OF A TROUT IT WAS A THIEVING HORSE EEL AND INSTEAD OF THE GOOSE KILLING A TROUT FOR THE KING'S SUPPER BY DAD THE EEL KILLED THE KING'S GOOSE AND SMALL BLAME TO HIM
322-124147-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
322-124147-0001 AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
322-124147-0002 BUT BY STIFFNESS OF MANNER AND RESENTFUL SILENCE HE SCARCELY EVER SPOKE TO HER AND THE ASSIDUOUS ATTENTIONS WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO SENSIBLE OF HIMSELF WERE TRANSFERRED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TO MISS LUCAS
322-124147-0003 MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
322-124147-0004 AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
322-124147-0005 AND ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR AUNT'S WHERE HIS REGRET AND VEXATION AND THE CONCERN OF EVERYBODY
322-124147-0006 TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
322-124147-0007 THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
322-124147-0008 AND IT WAS MOST ACCEPTABLE AS AN OCCASION OF INTRODUCING HIM TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER SOON AFTER THEIR RETURN A LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO MISS BENNET
322-124147-0009 THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
322-124147-0010 AND SAW HER DWELLING INTENTLY ON SOME PARTICULAR PASSAGES JANE RECOLLECTED HERSELF SOON AND PUTTING THE LETTER AWAY TRIED TO JOIN WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
322-124147-0011 BUT ELIZABETH FELT AN ANXIETY ON THE SUBJECT WHICH DREW OFF HER ATTENTION EVEN FROM WICKHAM AND NO SOONER HAD HE AND HIS COMPANION TAKEN LEAVE THAN A GLANCE FROM JANE INVITED HER TO FOLLOW HER UP STAIRS
322-124147-0012 IT IS UNLUCKY SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE PERIOD OF FUTURE HAPPINESS
322-124147-0013 TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
322-124147-0014 CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
322-124147-0015 HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
322-124147-0016 AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
322-124147-0017 WHY WILL YOU THINK SO IT MUST BE HIS OWN DOING HE IS HIS OWN MASTER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ALL I WILL READ YOU THE PASSAGE WHICH PARTICULARLY HURTS ME
322-124147-0018 I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
322-124147-0019 AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
322-124147-0020 IS HEIGHTENED INTO SOMETHING STILL MORE INTERESTING
322-124147-0021 HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
322-124147-0022 WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
322-124147-0023 IN INDULGING THE HOPE OF AN EVENT WHICH WILL SECURE THE HAPPINESS OF SO MANY
322-124147-0024 SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
322-124147-0025 AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
322-124147-0026 FOR MINE IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT WILL YOU HEAR IT MOST WILLINGLY YOU SHALL HAVE IT IN A FEW WORDS MISS BINGLEY SEES THAT HER BROTHER IS IN LOVE WITH YOU AND WANTS HIM TO MARRY MISS DARCY
322-124147-0027 SHE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOWN IN HOPE OF KEEPING HIM THERE AND TRIES TO PERSUADE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU JANE SHOOK HER HEAD INDEED JANE YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE ME
322-124147-0028 NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
322-124147-0029 BUT THE CASE IS THIS WE ARE NOT RICH ENOUGH OR GRAND ENOUGH FOR THEM AND SHE IS THE MORE ANXIOUS TO GET MISS DARCY FOR HER BROTHER FROM THE NOTION THAT WHEN THERE HAS BEEN ONE INTERMARRIAGE SHE MAY HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN ACHIEVING A SECOND
322-124147-0030 IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
322-124147-0031 THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
322-124147-0032 CAROLINE IS INCAPABLE OF WILFULLY DECEIVING ANYONE
322-124147-0033 IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
322-124147-0034 EVEN SUPPOSING THE BEST IN ACCEPTING A MAN WHOSE SISTERS AND FRIENDS ARE ALL WISHING HIM TO MARRY ELSEWHERE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF SAID ELIZABETH
322-124147-0035 AND IF UPON MATURE DELIBERATION YOU FIND THAT THE MISERY OF DISOBLIGING HIS TWO SISTERS IS MORE THAN EQUIVALENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF BEING HIS WIFE I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO REFUSE HIM
322-124147-0036 THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
322-124147-0037 HOWEVER OPENLY OR ARTFULLY SPOKEN COULD INFLUENCE A YOUNG MAN SO TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYONE SHE REPRESENTED TO HER SISTER AS FORCIBLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT
322-124147-0038 AND HAD SOON THE PLEASURE OF SEEING ITS HAPPY EFFECT JANE'S TEMPER WAS NOT DESPONDING AND SHE WAS GRADUALLY LED TO HOPE THOUGH THE DIFFIDENCE OF AFFECTION SOMETIMES OVERCAME THE HOPE THAT BINGLEY WOULD RETURN TO NETHERFIELD
322-124147-0039 AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
322-124147-0040 AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
322-124147-0041 AND SOON DINING AT LONGBOURN AND THE CONCLUSION OF ALL WAS THE COMFORTABLE DECLARATION THAT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INVITED ONLY TO A FAMILY DINNER SHE WOULD TAKE CARE TO HAVE TWO FULL COURSES
322-124147-0042 THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
322-124147-0043 IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
322-124147-0044 AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
322-124147-0045 BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
322-124147-0046 BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
322-124147-0047 HE WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID THE NOTICE OF HIS COUSINS FROM A CONVICTION THAT IF THEY SAW HIM DEPART THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO CONJECTURE HIS DESIGN
322-124147-0048 FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
322-124147-0049 MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
322-124147-0050 IN AS SHORT A TIME AS MISTER COLLINS'S LONG SPEECHES WOULD ALLOW EVERYTHING WAS SETTLED BETWEEN THEM TO THE SATISFACTION OF BOTH AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE
322-124147-0051 THE STUPIDITY WITH WHICH HE WAS FAVOURED BY NATURE MUST GUARD HIS COURTSHIP FROM ANY CHARM THAT COULD MAKE A WOMAN WISH FOR ITS CONTINUANCE AND MISS LUCAS
322-124147-0052 WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
322-124147-0053 AND HIS PROSPECTS OF FUTURE WEALTH WERE EXCEEDINGLY FAIR LADY LUCAS BEGAN DIRECTLY TO CALCULATE WITH MORE INTEREST THAN THE MATTER HAD EVER EXCITED BEFORE HOW MANY YEARS LONGER MISTER BENNET WAS LIKELY TO LIVE
322-124147-0054 AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
322-124147-0055 THE WHOLE FAMILY IN SHORT WERE PROPERLY OVERJOYED ON THE OCCASION THE YOUNGER GIRLS FORMED HOPES OF COMING OUT A YEAR OR TWO SOONER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
322-124147-0056 AND THE BOYS WERE RELIEVED FROM THEIR APPREHENSION OF CHARLOTTE'S DYING AN OLD MAID CHARLOTTE HERSELF WAS TOLERABLY COMPOSED SHE HAD GAINED HER POINT AND HAD TIME TO CONSIDER OF IT
322-124147-0057 HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
322-124147-0058 BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
322-124147-0059 AND HOWEVER UNCERTAIN OF GIVING HAPPINESS MUST BE THEIR PLEASANTEST PRESERVATIVE FROM WANT THIS PRESERVATIVE SHE HAD NOW OBTAINED AND AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN
322-124147-0060 WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
322-124147-0061 WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
322-124147-0062 SHE RESOLVED TO GIVE HER THE INFORMATION HERSELF AND THEREFORE CHARGED MISTER COLLINS WHEN HE RETURNED TO LONGBOURN TO DINNER TO DROP NO HINT OF WHAT HAD PASSED BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY
322-124147-0063 FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
322-124147-0064 FOR HE WAS LONGING TO PUBLISH HIS PROSPEROUS LOVE AS HE WAS TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TOO EARLY ON THE MORROW TO SEE ANY OF THE FAMILY THE CEREMONY OF LEAVE TAKING WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE LADIES MOVED FOR THE NIGHT
322-124147-0065 AND MISSUS BENNET WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CORDIALITY SAID HOW HAPPY THEY SHOULD BE TO SEE HIM AT LONGBOURN AGAIN
322-124147-0066 MY DEAR MADAM HE REPLIED THIS INVITATION IS PARTICULARLY GRATIFYING BECAUSE IT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN HOPING TO RECEIVE
322-124147-0067 AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
322-124147-0068 IMMEDIATELY SAID BUT IS THERE NOT DANGER OF LADY CATHERINE'S DISAPPROBATION HERE MY GOOD SIR YOU HAD BETTER NEGLECT YOUR RELATIONS THAN RUN THE RISK OF OFFENDING YOUR PATRONESS MY DEAR SIR
322-124147-0069 YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
322-124147-0070 STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
322-124147-0071 AS FOR MY FAIR COUSINS THOUGH MY ABSENCE MAY NOT BE LONG ENOUGH TO RENDER IT NECESSARY
322-124147-0072 NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
322-124147-0073 THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
322-124147-0074 RELATED THE EVENT OF THE DAY BEFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTER COLLINS'S FANCYING HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER FRIEND HAD ONCE OCCURRED TO ELIZABETH WITHIN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BUT THAT CHARLOTTE COULD ENCOURAGE HIM
322-124147-0075 SEEMED ALMOST AS FAR FROM POSSIBILITY
322-124147-0076 AND HER ASTONISHMENT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SO GREAT AS TO OVERCOME AT FIRST THE BOUNDS OF DECORUM AND SHE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT ENGAGED TO MISTER COLLINS
322-124147-0077 THE STEADY COUNTENANCE WHICH MISS LUCAS HAD COMMANDED IN TELLING HER STORY GAVE WAY TO A MOMENTARY CONFUSION HERE ON RECEIVING SO DIRECT A REPROACH THOUGH AS IT WAS NO MORE THAN SHE EXPECTED
322-124147-0078 SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
322-124147-0079 AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
322-124147-0080 I HOPE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE DONE I AM NOT ROMANTIC YOU KNOW I NEVER WAS I ASK ONLY A COMFORTABLE HOME AND CONSIDERING MISTER COLLINS'S CHARACTER
322-124147-0081 I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
322-124147-0082 THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
322-124147-0083 THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
211-122442-0000 HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY
211-122442-0001 WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
211-122442-0002 WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
211-122442-0003 BUT ONE HAS COME OF ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOCKHEAD I MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I CAME IN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE KEY OF YOUR APARTMENT IN MY POCKET
211-122442-0004 I FOUND A LETTER ON THE GREEN TABLE COVER IN YOUR BEDROOM AND WHERE IS THAT LETTER
211-122442-0005 IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
211-122442-0006 THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
211-122442-0007 THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0008 WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
211-122442-0009 HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
211-122442-0010 DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
211-122442-0011 EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
211-122442-0012 MY DEAR PLANCHET I AM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
211-122442-0013 WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS
211-122442-0014 AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS
211-122442-0015 I AM GOING OUT FOR ALL DAY PERHAPS YOU ARE THEREFORE YOUR OWN MASTER TILL SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING BUT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK YOU MUST HOLD YOURSELF IN READINESS WITH TWO HORSES
211-122442-0016 WE ARE GOING AGAIN IT APPEARS TO HAVE OUR HIDES PIERCED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS YOU WILL TAKE YOUR MUSKETOON AND YOUR PISTOLS
211-122442-0017 AH LIKE THE CHARMING JOURNEY THE OTHER DAY

211-122442-0020 PERHAPS THERE IS BUT ONE AT THIS MOMENT BUT BY THIS EVENING THERE WILL BE FOUR IT APPEARS THAT OUR JOURNEY WAS A REMOUNTING JOURNEY THEN EXACTLY SO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND NODDING TO PLANCHET HE WENT OUT
211-122442-0021 D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
211-122442-0022 BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0023 THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
211-122442-0024 WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
211-122442-0025 D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
211-122442-0026 IN A TINE OF PERFECT GOOD FELLOWSHIP WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOU ALL THESE DAYS

211-122442-0032 SO TRIFLING INDEED THAT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT PERCEIVE IT ANY MORE THAN HE HAD THE MOMENTARY SHADE WHICH AN INSTANT BEFORE HAD DARKENED THE COUNTENANCE OF THE WORTHY MAN AH MAY YOU BE A TRUE PROPHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING NO
211-122442-0033 IS ONLY THAT I MAY KNOW WHETHER I AM DELAYING YOU WHY THAT QUESTION MY DEAR HOST ASKED D'ARTAGNAN DO YOU INTEND TO SIT UP FOR ME NO BUT SINCE MY ARREST AND THE ROBBERY THAT WAS COMMITTED IN MY HOUSE I AM ALARMED EVERY TIME I HEAR A DOOR OPEN
211-122442-0034 PARTICULARLY IN THE NIGHT WHAT THE DEUCE CAN YOU EXPECT I AM NO SWORDSMAN WELL DON'T BE ALARMED IF I RETURN AT ONE TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
211-122442-0035 THAT D'ARTAGNAN COULD NOT HELP PERCEIVING IT AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER
211-122442-0036 WHICH SEIZE ME ALL AT ONCE AND I HAVE JUST FELT A COLD SHIVER PAY NO ATTENTION TO IT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO OCCUPY YOURSELF WITH BUT BEING HAPPY THEN I HAVE FULL OCCUPATION FOR I AM SO NOT YET WAIT A LITTLE THIS EVENING YOU SAID WELL

211-122442-0066 DID NOT INSPIRE HIM WITH THE LEAST SUSPICION OF HIS PRETTY HOSTESS
211-122442-0067 WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR THREE COMPANIONS
211-122442-0068 DETAINED BY AN ACCUSATION OF COINING
211-122442-0069 AND HOW THE DEVIL DID YOU ESCAPE
211-122442-0070 THEY MERIT RICHLY THAT PIECE OF ATTENTION ON YOUR PART
211-122442-0071 AH YOUNG MAN YOUNG MAN SOME FLIRTATION OR OTHER
211-122442-0072 IT IS WOMAN WHO HAS RUINED US STILL RUINS US AND WILL RUIN US AS LONG AS THE WORLD STANDS TAKE MY ADVICE AND SET OUT THIS EVENING
211-122442-0073 AH THAT'S QUITE ANOTHER THING BUT PROMISE ME IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE KILLED TONIGHT THAT YOU WILL GO TOMORROW I PROMISE IT DO YOU NEED MONEY
211-122442-0074 BUT YOUR COMPANIONS I DON'T THINK THEY CAN BE IN NEED OF ANY WE LEFT PARIS EACH WITH SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES IN HIS POCKET SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
211-122442-0075 NEITHER OF THEM HAD RETURNED THEIR LACKEYS LIKEWISE WERE ABSENT AND NOTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER
211-122442-0076 AS HE PASSED THE HOTEL DES GARDES HE TOOK A GLANCE IN TO THE STABLES THREE OF THE FOUR HORSES HAD ALREADY ARRIVED
211-122442-0077 WAS BUSY GROOMING THEM AND HAD ALREADY FINISHED TWO
211-122442-0078 HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU WHY SO PLANCHET ASKED THE YOUNG MAN
211-122442-0079 BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
211-122442-0080 TWO OR THREE TIMES BAH PREOCCUPIED AS MONSIEUR WAS WITH THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT BUT I WHOM THE STRANGE FASHION IN WHICH THAT LETTER CAME INTO THE HOUSE HAD PLACED ON MY GUARD I DID NOT LOSE A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES
211-122442-0081 AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
211-122442-0082 SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
211-122442-0083 HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0002 ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0005 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0014 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0017 THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0020 WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0032 THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0038 NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0041 FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0047 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0056 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0062 HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0068 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0074 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0083 ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0086 BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0089 THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0092 HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0095 SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
2514-149482-0096 THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
2514-149482-0097 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0098 DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
2514-149482-0099 WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0101 SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
2514-149482-0102 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0104 CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
2514-149482-0105 THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
2514-149482-0106 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2514-149482-0107 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
2136-5147-0000 LADY KNOLLYS PURSUED HER ENQUIRIES AND WHY DOES NOT MADAME MAKE YOUR DRESSES MY DEAR I WAGER A GUINEA THE WOMAN'S A MILLINER DID NOT SHE ENGAGE TO MAKE YOUR DRESSES I

2136-5147-0004 BUT SHE MAY ALSO BE ABOUT THE MOST PERNICIOUS INMATE IMAGINABLE SHE MAY TEACH YOU A BAD ACCENT
2136-5147-0005 AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT BESIDE SEND THE HOUSEKEEPER MY DEAR TO TELL HER THAT I AM GOING TO SEE HER I HAD BETTER GO MYSELF PERHAPS I SAID FEARING A COLLISION BETWEEN MISSUS RUSK AND THE BITTER FRENCHWOMAN VERY WELL DEAR
2136-5147-0006 NOT SORRY SOMEHOW TO ESCAPE BEFORE CAPTAIN OAKLEY RETURNED AS I WENT ALONG THE PASSAGE I WAS THINKING WHETHER MY DRESS COULD BE SO VERY RIDICULOUS AS MY OLD COUSIN THOUGHT IT AND TRYING IN VAIN
2136-5147-0007 TO RECOLLECT ANY EVIDENCE OF A SIMILAR CONTEMPTUOUS ESTIMATE ON THE PART OF THAT BEAUTIFUL AND GARRULOUS DANDY I COULD NOT QUITE THE REVERSE INDEED STILL I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND FEVERISH
2136-5147-0008 GIRLS OF MY THEN AGE WILL EASILY CONCEIVE HOW MISERABLE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH A MISGIVING WOULD MAKE THEM IT WAS A LONG WAY TO MADAME'S ROOM I MET MISSUS RUSK BUSTLING ALONG THE PASSAGE WITH A HOUSEMAID
2136-5147-0009 HOW IS MADAME I ASKED QUITE WELL I BELIEVE ANSWERED THE HOUSEKEEPER DRILY NOTHING THE MATTER THAT I KNOW OF SHE EAT ENOUGH FOR TWO TO DAY
2136-5147-0010 I TRY TO SWALLOW A LITTLE TO PLEASE HER AND YOUR COLD IS IT BETTER SHE SHOOK HER HEAD LANGUIDLY HER ELBOW RESTING ON THE CHAIR AND THREE FINGER TIPS SUPPORTING HER FOREHEAD AND THEN SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGH
2136-5147-0011 LOOKING DOWN FROM THE CORNERS OF HER EYES IN AN INTERESTING DEJECTION
2136-5147-0012 BUT I AM QUAITE APPY
2136-5147-0013 AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE TURNED A LANGUID GLANCE OF GRATITUDE ON ME WHICH DROPPED ON THE GROUND LADY KNOLLYS WISHES VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES IF YOU COULD ADMIT HER
2136-5147-0014 VOUS SAVEZ LES MALADES SEE NEVER VISITORS SHE REPLIED WITH A STARTLED SORT OF TARTNESS AND A MOMENTARY ENERGY BESIDES I CANNOT CONVERSE
2136-5147-0015 OF HEAD AND OF THE EAR THE RIGHT EAR IT IS PARFOIS AGONY ABSOLUTELY AND NOW IT IS HERE AND SHE WINCED AND MOANED WITH HER EYES CLOSED AND HER HAND PRESSED TO THE ORGAN AFFECTED
2136-5147-0016 SIMPLE AS I WAS I FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT MADAME WAS SHAMMING SHE WAS OVER ACTING HER TRANSITIONS WERE TOO VIOLENT AND BESIDE SHE FORGOT THAT I KNEW HOW WELL SHE COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AND MUST PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS HEIGHTENING THE INTEREST OF HER HELPLESSNESS
2136-5147-0017 BY THAT PRETTY TESSELLATION OF FOREIGN IDIOM I THERE FORE SAID WITH A KIND OF COURAGE WHICH SOMETIMES HELPED ME SUDDENLY OH MADAME DON'T YOU REALLY THINK YOU MIGHT WITHOUT MUCH INCONVENIENCE SEE LADY KNOLLYS FOR A VERY FEW MINUTES
2136-5147-0018 BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU MUST SEE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE I NEVER YOU KNOW REFUSE TO TAKE TROUBLE WHEN I AM ABLE NEVER NEVER AND MADAME SHED SOME TEARS WHICH ALWAYS CAME AT CALL
2136-5147-0019 AND WITH HER HAND PRESSED TO HER EAR SAID VERY FAINTLY BE SO GOOD TO TELL YOUR FRIEND HOW YOU SEE ME AND HOW I SUFFER
2136-5147-0020 SINCE THE PAIN WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO REMAIN LONGER SO WITH A FEW WORDS OF COMFORT WHICH COULD NOT WELL BE REFUSED
2136-5147-0021 I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM
2136-5147-0022 HAS GONE TO THE BILLIARD ROOM I THINK
2136-5147-0023 THAT THEN ACCOUNTED FOR THE RUMBLE AND SMACK OF BALLS WHICH I HAD HEARD AS I PASSED THE DOOR I HAVE BEEN TELLING MAUD HOW DETESTABLY SHE IS GOT UP VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU MONICA SAID MY FATHER
2136-5147-0024 YES AND REALLY AUSTIN IT IS QUITE CLEAR YOU OUGHT TO MARRY YOU WANT SOME ONE TO TAKE THIS GIRL OUT AND LOOK AFTER HER AND WHO'S TO DO IT
2136-5147-0025 AND IT IS REALLY SUCH A PITY FOR SHE'S A VERY PRETTY CREATURE AND A CLEVER WOMAN COULD MAKE HER QUITE CHARMING
2136-5147-0026 EIGHT AND TWENTY YEARS AGO OR MORE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WELL YOU KNOW SHE HAS GOT EVER SO MUCH NOW
2136-5147-0027 AND THOUGH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HER THEN SHE HAS HAD HER SECOND HUSBAND SINCE I CAN TELL YOU I'M GLAD I WAS NOT THE FIRST SAID MY FATHER WELL THEY REALLY SAY HER WEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY IMMENSE HER LAST HUSBAND
2136-5147-0028 THE RUSSIAN MERCHANT LEFT HER EVERYTHING SHE HAS NOT A HUMAN RELATION AND SHE IS IN THE BEST SET YOU WERE ALWAYS A MATCH MAKER MONICA SAID MY FATHER STOPPING AND PUTTING HIS HAND KINDLY ON HERS
2136-5147-0029 BUT IT WON'T DO NO NO MONICA WE MUST TAKE CARE OF LITTLE MAUD SOME OTHER WAY I WAS RELIEVED WE WOMEN HAVE ALL AN INSTINCTIVE DREAD OF SECOND MARRIAGES
2136-5147-0030 AND THINK THAT NO WIDOWER IS QUITE ABOVE OR BELOW THAT DANGER AND I REMEMBER WHENEVER MY FATHER WHICH INDEED WAS BUT SELDOM MADE A VISIT TO TOWN OR ANYWHERE ELSE IT WAS A SAYING OF MISSUS RUSK
2136-5147-0031 I SHAN'T WONDER NEITHER NEED YOU MY DEAR IF HE BRINGS HOME A YOUNG WIFE WITH HIM SO MY FATHER WITH A KIND LOOK AT HER AND A VERY TENDER ONE ON ME WENT SILENTLY TO THE LIBRARY AS HE OFTEN DID ABOUT THAT HOUR
2136-5147-0032 I SUPPOSE THEY DID NOT WISH A REVOLUTION AND ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES AT KNOWL AND THOUGHT IT NO HARM TO EXCITE MY VIGILANCE BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE LONG TO BE VEXED WITH COUSIN MONICA
2136-5147-0033 YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOUR FATHER IS AN ODDITY SHE SAID I DON'T MIND HIM I NEVER DID YOU MUST NOT CRACKY MY DEAR CRACKY DECIDEDLY CRACKY AND SHE TAPPED THE CORNER OF HER FOREHEAD WITH A LOOK SO SLY AND COMICAL

2136-5147-0036 SHE SCALED THE STAIRS I FOLLOWING AND HAVING FOUND THE REMEDIES WE APPROACHED MADAME'S ROOM TOGETHER I THINK WHILE WE WERE STILL AT THE END OF THE GALLERY MADAME HEARD AND DIVINED OUR APPROACH FOR HER DOOR SUDDENLY SHUT
2136-5147-0037 AND THERE WAS A FUMBLING AT THE HANDLE BUT THE BOLT WAS OUT OF ORDER
2136-5147-0038 THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WE BOTH ENTERED MADAME HAD ROLLED HERSELF IN THE BLUE COVERLET AND WAS LYING ON THE BED WITH HER FACE BURIED IN THE PILLOW AND ENVELOPED IN THE COVERING PERHAPS SHE'S ASLEEP SAID LADY KNOLLYS
2136-5147-0039 GETTING ROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE BED AND STOOPING OVER HER MADAME LAY STILL AS A MOUSE COUSIN MONICA SET DOWN HER TWO LITTLE VIALS ON THE TABLE AND STOOPING AGAIN OVER THE BED BEGAN VERY GENTLY WITH HER FINGERS TO LIFT THE COVERLET THAT COVERED HER FACE
2136-5147-0040 MADAME UTTERED A SLUMBERING MOAN AND TURNED MORE UPON HER FACE CLASPING THE COVERLET FASTER ABOUT HER MADAME IT IS MAUD AND LADY KNOLLYS WE HAVE COME TO RELIEVE YOUR EAR PRAY LET ME SEE IT
2136-5143-0000 CHAPTER SIX A WALK IN THE WOOD TWO LITTLE PIECES OF BY PLAY IN WHICH I DETECTED HER CONFIRMED MY UNPLEASANT SUSPICION FROM THE CORNER OF THE GALLERY I ONE DAY SAW HER WHEN SHE THOUGHT I WAS OUT AND ALL QUIET

2136-5143-0010 AND SOME DROPS OF LAUDANUM WHENEVER THE PAIN OF STOMACH RETURNED
2136-5143-0011 SHE CLAIMED HER MEDICINE MAN'S ESTIMATE OF WOMAN IS HIGHER THAN WOMAN'S OWN PERHAPS IN THEIR RELATIONS TO MEN THEY ARE GENERALLY MORE TRUSTWORTHY PERHAPS WOMAN'S IS THE JUSTER AND THE OTHER AN APPOINTED ILLUSION

2136-5143-0044 THIS DID NOT LAST VERY LONG HOWEVER AND SHE SOON RESUMED HER WONTED WAYS AND SHE RETURNED TO THE QUESTION OF THE WILL BUT NOT SO DIRECTLY AND WITH MORE ART
1841-159771-0000 THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING OUR TIME HERE SAID SOLOMON OWL TO HIS SMALL COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER IT'S A FINE NIGHT THE MICE WILL ALL BE OUT SOONER OR LATER LET'S GO OVER AND SIT IN THAT OLD OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW
1841-159771-0001 SIMON SCREECHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING AND THEY HAD NO SOONER SETTLED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHEN SIMON STARTED TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HIS WELL KNOWN QUAVERING WHISTLE SOLOMON OWL STOPPED HIM QUICKLY
1841-159771-0002 DON'T DO THAT HE SAID SHARPLY DO YOU WANT TO SCARE THE MICE SIMON SCREECHER CUT HIS WHISTLE OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I FORGOT HE MURMURED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY WHISTLING WOULD DO ANY HARM
1841-159771-0003 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MICE LEFT ON FARMER GREEN'S PLACE IT'S MY OPINION THAT THEY'VE MOVED AWAY MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE OLD ROUGH LEG THE HAWK HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN HIS SHARE
1841-159771-0004 SOLOMON OWL MADE NO REPLY HE WAS A PERSON OF FEW WORDS IF ANYBODY ASKED HIS OPINION HE WAS READY TO GIVE IT BUT HE SELDOM GAVE ANY UNSOUGHT ADVICE
1841-159771-0005 I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND SAID SIMON SCREECHER THAT I'D MOVE TO SOME OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IF I KNEW WHERE THERE WAS GOOD MOUSING I'D MOVE TO MORROW WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING SOLOMON OWL STARTED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
1841-159771-0006 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SEND THEM A TELEGRAM SAYING THAT YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO MEET THEM AT EIGHT P M SIMON SCREECHER WAS SILENCED FOR THE TIME BEING AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SOLOMON OWL GAVE ANOTHER START THERE'S THAT SQUEAK AGAIN HE WHISPERED
1841-159771-0007 I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING NEARER TOO NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HAD A TUNNEL THAT LED RIGHT BENEATH THE TREE WHERE THE TWO COUSINS WERE SITTING
1841-159771-0008 AND HE HAD STROLLED THAT WAY AFTER SCURRYING UNDER THE SNOW WHEN HE HEARD SOLOMON OWL LAUGHING IN THE WOODS EARLIER IN THE EVENING IT WAS HE THAT SOLOMON HEARD IT WAS HE THAT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF A HOLE IN THE SNOW AND PEEPED UP AT THE STAR SPRINKLED SKY
1841-159771-0009 HE MUST HAVE HURRIED OVER HERE FROM THE WOODS HE MUST BE VERY HUNGRY AS SOLOMON OWL RETURNED TO THE OLD OAK HIS COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER LAUGHED SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANTLY MISSED HIM DIDN'T YOU HE INQUIRED YES
1841-159771-0010 WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB HIM OUT OF THE SNOW SIMON ASKED WHAT ARE YOUR CLAWS FOR WHAT'S YOUR BEAK FOR I COULDN'T DIG HIM OUT SOLOMON OWL REPLIED THE SNOW IS THREE FEET DEEP
1841-159771-0011 AND IT HAS SEVEN DIFFERENT CRUSTS ONE UNDER ANOTHER THIS IS A HARD WINTER SAID SIMON SCREECHER I WISH I'D GONE SOUTH LAST FALL I WONDER HOW THE MOUSING IS DOWN THERE
1841-159771-0012 EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
1841-159771-0013 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0014 AND VISITED THE FARMYARD IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A BITE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER EVEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BEGAN TO FIND IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET ENOUGH SEEDS UNDER THE SNOW TO SATISFY HIS HUNGER
1841-159771-0015 HE HAD STORED AWAY A STOCK OF FOOD BUT IT HADN'T BEEN BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT REPEAT IT ANOTHER TIME
1841-159771-0016 UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T GIVE HIM A SQUARE MEAL WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
1841-159771-0017 THIS IS MY FIRST WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE EXPLAINED I'M RUNNING SHORT OF FOOD AND I WISH YOU'D TELL ME WHAT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE THAT'S EASY HIS COUSIN ANSWERED GET MORE
1841-159771-0018 AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY FOR HE HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO POOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE RAN AFTER HIM IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW HIS COUSIN THROUGH THE WINDING GALLERIES BENEATH THE SNOW
1841-159771-0019 SEVERAL TIMES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TOOK THE WRONG TURN AND HAD TO RETRACE HIS STEPS BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HIS BUSY COUSIN AGAIN YOU ADVISED ME TO GET MORE FOOD SAID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
1841-159771-0020 IN THE ORCHARD HIS COUSIN CRIED AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY AGAIN I WISH HE'D WAIT A MINUTE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE GRUMBLED AS HE TORE AFTER HIS COUSIN ONCE MORE
1841-159771-0021 I DON'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING I HAVEN'T HAD A HEARTY MEAL FOR DAYS THE COUSIN SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE OVERTOOK HIM WHAT THAT BUSY GENTLEMAN EXCLAIMED HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE ORCHARD AND BACK SO SOON NO
1841-159771-0022 HAVING SAID THOSE THREE WORDS HE DASHED OFF AGAIN EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE TREES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ECHOED I CAN'T EAT TREES
1841-159771-0023 THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MY COUSIN FORGOT TO EXPLAIN SO I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO RUN AFTER HIM AGAIN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT THE FOURTH TIME THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE FOUND HIS COUSIN HE TOOK NO CHANCES
1841-159771-0024 HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
1841-159771-0025 HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
1841-159771-0026 THEN AND NOT TILL THEN DID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE LET HIM GO MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CHASED HIS COUSIN NO MORE BUT HURRIED AWAY TO FARMER GREEN'S ORCHARD WHERE HE GNAWED A RING
1841-159771-0027 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0028 I OUGHT TO HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THOSE YOUNG TREES HE TOLD THE HIRED MAN THIS IS WHAT COMES OF A HARD WINTER
1841-159771-0029 A COLD DIP IN ONE WAY PETER MINK WAS LIKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HE ENJOYED SWIMMING AND HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ALONG THE STREAMS THAT THREADED THEIR WAY THROUGH PLEASANT VALLEY SOMETIMES PETER DAWDLED ON THE BANKS OF SWIFT RIVER
1841-159771-0030 SOMETIMES HE LINGERED FOR DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BLACK CREEK NOR DID HE DISDAIN SO SMALL A STREAM AS THE BROOK THAT CROSSED THE MEADOW IT WAS DEEP ENOUGH FOR A SWIM AND HE KNEW THAT MUSKRATS LIVED UNDER ITS BANKS
1841-159771-0031 WELL PETER MINK HAD SURPRISED MANY A ONE SWIMMING IN THE BROOK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MEADOW MICE PERHAPS HE WOULDN'T HAVE VISITED THE BROOK SO OFTEN EVEN IN WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE JUST HAD TO HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN
1841-159771-0032 JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
1841-159771-0033 WHEN PETER MINK WANDERED ALONG A STREAM IN WINTER HE PREFERRED TO TRAVEL UNDER THE ICE RATHER THAN WALK UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF IT
1841-159771-0034 IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER THERE WAS A DRY STRIP ALONG THE EDGE OF THE STREAM WHERE HE COULD STEAL SILENTLY ALONG WITHOUT WETTING HIS FEET WHEN HE FOUND NO PLACE TO WALK HE SWAM NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS TRICK OF PETER MINK'S
1841-159771-0035 THIS TRICK OF LURKING BENEATH THE ICE OF RIVER CREEK AND BROOK BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WOULD HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN DESPITE PETER MINK AND HIS PROWLING WAYS TO BE SURE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TRIED TO BE CAREFUL
1841-159771-0036 BEFORE HE CREPT FROM THE END OF HIS TUNNEL HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ALL AROUND HE PEEPED UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK HE EVEN STARED INTO THE WATER AND THEN IF HE SAW NOBODY THAT WAS FIERCER THAN PADDY MUSKRAT
1841-159771-0037 ONLY THEN WOULD HE VENTURE TO SKIP TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND PLUNGE IN TO TELL THE TRUTH MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS FELT SAFER WHEN ONE OF THE MUSKRAT FAMILY HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A SWIM AT THE SAME TIME
1841-159771-0038 FOR THE MUSKRATS ALL HAD A WARNING SIGNAL THAT TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN THERE WAS DANGER WHEN ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER MINK HE NEVER FAILED IF HE WAS IN THE WATER TO GIVE A LOUD SLAP UPON THE SURFACE WITH HIS TAIL
1841-159771-0039 MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
1841-159771-0040 HE SAID THAT HE COULD DRY HIS COAT AFTER HE REACHED HOME WHILE IF HE STOPPED TO DRY IT AT THE EDGE OF THE BROOK PERHAPS HE'D NEVER GET HOME AT ALL YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
1841-159771-0041 OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
1841-159771-0042 AND THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN IT WAS WELL WORTH HIS WHILE TO TAKE THE LITTLE EXTRA TROUBLE OF PEEPING OUT BEFORE HE HAD HIS SWIM FOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SNAKELIKE HEAD THAT DARTED OUT FROM UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK AND DARTED BACK AGAIN OUT OF SIGHT
1841-179183-0000 AND HIS TONGUE GAVE MY HAND A LICK HE PRESSED CLOSE TO ME AS IF HE WERE FAIN TO CROWD HIMSELF INTO MY HAND HE LOVED IT WITH HIS TAIL WITH HIS PAW WITH HIS TONGUE IF HE COULD SPEAK I BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY WITH ME
1841-179183-0001 THAT PARADISE IS ATTAINED BY TOUCH FOR IN TOUCH IS ALL LOVE AND INTELLIGENCE THIS SMALL INCIDENT STARTED ME ON A CHAT ABOUT HANDS AND IF MY CHAT IS FORTUNATE I HAVE TO THANK MY DOG STAR
1841-179183-0002 IN ANY CASE IT IS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS MONOPOLIZED IT IS LIKE MAKING A NEW PATH IN THE TRACKLESS WOODS BLAZING THE TRAIL WHERE NO FOOT HAS PRESSED BEFORE
1841-179183-0003 I AM GLAD TO TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND LEAD YOU ALONG AN UNTRODDEN WAY INTO A WORLD WHERE THE HAND IS SUPREME BUT AT THE VERY OUTSET WE ENCOUNTER A DIFFICULTY YOU ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO LIGHT
1841-179183-0004 I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BE LED INTO FIRE OR WATER OR FALL INTO A DEEP PIT IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME PATIENTLY YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE'S A SOUND SO FINE NOTHING LIVES TWIXT IT AND SILENCE
1841-179183-0005 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0006 A SLIGHT FLUTTER OF THE FINGERS BEGAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE JOY THE FULLNESS OF MY LIFE LIKE JOB I FEEL AS IF A HAND HAD MADE ME FASHIONED ME TOGETHER ROUND ABOUT AND MOULDED MY VERY SOUL
1841-179183-0007 IN ALL MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS I AM CONSCIOUS OF A HAND WHATEVER MOVES ME WHATEVER THRILLS ME IS AS A HAND THAT TOUCHES ME IN THE DARK AND THAT TOUCH IS MY REALITY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A SIGHT WHICH MAKES YOU GLAD
1841-179183-0008 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND RESULTANT COMBINATIONS WHICH TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND CONSTITUTE MY WORLD IDEAS MAKE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND IMPRESSIONS FURNISH IDEAS MY WORLD IS BUILT OF TOUCH SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0009 BUT WITHOUT COLOUR AND SOUND IT BREATHES AND THROBS WITH LIFE
1841-179183-0010 OF BEAUTY OR OF INCONGRUITY FOR WITH MY HANDS I CAN FEEL THE COMIC AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT YOU DEPENDENT ON YOUR SIGHT DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY THINGS ARE TANGIBLE
1841-179183-0011 ALL PALPABLE THINGS ARE MOBILE OR RIGID SOLID OR LIQUID BIG OR SMALL WARM OR COLD AND THESE QUALITIES ARE VARIOUSLY MODIFIED
1841-179183-0012 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0013 THE VELVET OF THE ROSE IS NOT THAT OF A RIPE PEACH OR OF A BABY'S DIMPLED CHEEK THE HARDNESS OF THE ROCK IS TO THE HARDNESS OF WOOD WHAT A MAN'S DEEP BASS IS TO A WOMAN'S VOICE WHEN IT IS LOW
1841-179183-0014 WHAT I CALL BEAUTY I FIND IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ALL THESE QUALITIES AND IS LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE FLOW OF CURVED AND STRAIGHT LINES WHICH IS OVER ALL THINGS WHAT DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE MEAN TO YOU
1841-179183-0015 IT MEANS SEVERAL THINGS IT SYMBOLIZES DUTY IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE QUALITY OF INEXORABLENESS THAT DUTY HAS WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THAT MUST NOT BE SET ASIDE I FEEL AS IF I WERE GOING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE
1841-179183-0016 OR GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT SWERVING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO ESCAPE THIS MORALIZING YOU SHOULD ASK HOW DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE FEEL IT FEELS AS I SUPPOSE IT LOOKS STRAIGHT
1841-179183-0017 NOW BROKEN OFF OR LENGTHENED OR SWELLING THEY RISE AND SINK BENEATH MY FINGERS THEY ARE FULL OF SUDDEN STARTS AND PAUSES AND THEIR VARIETY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WONDERFUL SO YOU SEE I AM NOT SHUT OUT FROM THE REGION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
1841-179183-0018 THOUGH MY HAND CANNOT PERCEIVE THE BRILLIANT COLOURS IN THE SUNSET OR ON THE MOUNTAIN OR REACH INTO THE BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY PHYSICS TELLS ME THAT I AM WELL OFF IN A WORLD WHICH I AM TOLD KNOWS NEITHER COLD NOR SOUND
1841-179183-0019 FOR AT LEAST EVERY OBJECT APPEARS TO MY FINGERS STANDING SOLIDLY RIGHT SIDE UP AND IS NOT AN INVERTED IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOUR BRAIN IS AT INFINITE THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS LABOUR TO SET BACK ON ITS FEET
1841-179183-0020 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0022 THE PLEASING CHANGES OF ROUGH AND SMOOTH PLIANT AND RIGID CURVED AND STRAIGHT IN THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF A TREE GIVE THE TRUTH TO MY HAND THE IMMOVABLE ROCK WITH ITS JUTS AND WARPED SURFACE
1841-179183-0023 A BIRD IN MY HAND WAS THEN WORTH TWO IN THE BARNYARD MY FINGERS CANNOT OF COURSE GET THE IMPRESSION OF A LARGE WHOLE AT A GLANCE BUT I FEEL THE PARTS AND MY MIND PUTS THEM TOGETHER
1841-179183-0024 I MOVE AROUND MY HOUSE TOUCHING OBJECT AFTER OBJECT IN ORDER BEFORE I CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES I CAN TOUCH ONLY WHAT IS SHOWN TO ME THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST
1841-179183-0025 CARVINGS ON THE WALL OR A CURIOUS ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE EXHIBITED LIKE THE FAMILY ALBUM THEREFORE A HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM NOT FAMILIAR HAS FOR ME AT FIRST NO GENERAL EFFECT OR HARMONY OF DETAIL
1841-179183-0026 IT IS NOT A COMPLETE CONCEPTION BUT A COLLECTION OF OBJECT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AS THEY COME TO ME ARE DISCONNECTED AND ISOLATED BUT MY MIND IS FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0027 THEORIES AND WITH THEM IT CONSTRUCTS THE HOUSE THE PROCESS REMINDS ME OF THE BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
1841-179183-0028 THE SILENT WORKER IS IMAGINATION WHICH DECREES REALITY OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT IMAGINATION WHAT A POOR THING MY WORLD WOULD BE
1841-179183-0029 MY GARDEN WOULD BE A SILENT PATCH OF EARTH STREWN WITH STICKS OF A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SMELLS BUT WHEN THE EYE OF MY MIND IS OPENED TO ITS BEAUTY THE BARE GROUND BRIGHTENS BENEATH MY FEET AND THE HEDGE ROW BURSTS INTO LEAF
1841-179183-0030 AND THE ROSE TREE SHAKES ITS FRAGRANCE EVERYWHERE I KNOW HOW BUDDING TREES LOOK AND I ENTER INTO THE AMOROUS JOY OF THE MATING BIRDS AND THIS IS THE MIRACLE OF IMAGINATION
1841-179183-0031 WHICH HE HAS EMBODIED IN A SCULPTURED FORM ALTHOUGH COMPARED WITH THE LIFE WARM MOBILE FACE OF A FRIEND THE MARBLE IS COLD AND PULSELESS AND UNRESPONSIVE YET IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO MY HAND
1841-179183-0032 ITS FLOWING CURVES AND BENDINGS ARE A REAL PLEASURE ONLY BREATH IS WANTING BUT UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINATION THE MARBLE THRILLS AND BECOMES THE DIVINE REALITY OF THE IDEAL IMAGINATION PUTS A SENTIMENT INTO EVERY LINE AND CURVE
1841-179183-0033 AND THE STATUE IN MY TOUCH IS INDEED THE GODDESS HERSELF WHO BREATHES AND MOVES AND ENCHANTS IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT SOME SCULPTURES EVEN RECOGNIZED MASTERPIECES DO NOT PLEASE MY HAND
1841-179183-0034 WHEN I TOUCH WHAT THERE IS OF THE WINGED VICTORY IT REMINDS ME AT FIRST OF A HEADLESS LIMBLESS DREAM THAT FLIES TOWARDS ME IN AN UNRESTFUL SLEEP
1841-179183-0035 THE GARMENTS OF THE VICTORY THRUST STIFFLY OUT BEHIND AND DO NOT RESEMBLE GARMENTS THAT I HAVE FELT FLYING FLUTTERING FOLDING SPREADING IN THE WIND
1841-179183-0036 BUT IMAGINATION FULFILS THESE IMPERFECTIONS AND STRAIGHTWAY THE VICTORY BECOMES A POWERFUL AND SPIRITED FIGURE WITH THE SWEEP OF SEA WINDS IN HER ROBES AND THE SPLENDOUR OF CONQUEST IN HER WINGS
1841-179183-0037 AND I LIKE THE LUXURIANT WAVY HAIR OF BACCHUS AND APOLLO AND THE WREATH OF IVY SO SUGGESTIVE OF PAGAN HOLIDAYS SO IMAGINATION CROWNS THE EXPERIENCE OF MY HANDS
1841-179183-0038 AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
6064-56165-0000 HE WAS A HARVARD SOPHOMORE AND REALIZED HIS OWN IMPORTANCE QUITE AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID BUT STILL THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM JUST FOR A MINUTE AND TELL THEM SOME OF THE LATEST CAMBRIDGE NEWS
6064-56165-0001 HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO CALL IT GOSSIP IF THERE WAS ANY ONE THING IN THE WORLD HE HATED SO HE SAID IT WAS GIRLS TALK THIS JABBERING ABOUT NOTHING FOR HIS PART HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME THAT WAY
6064-56165-0002 YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
6064-56165-0003 AND HE WOULD GROW ALMOST ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN DESCRIBING THE TUSSLE BETWEEN NED BROWN AND STANLEY HOOPER OVER THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF BOSTON AND NEW YORK IN WHICH HOOPER THE NEW YORKER WAS TERRIBLY BEATEN AND UPON MY WORD HE CONCLUDED
6064-56165-0004 I WASN'T SORRY FOR THE NEW YORK SET IS GETTING JUST UNBEARABLE I WOULDN'T SO MUCH MIND FIGHTING STANLEY HOOPER MYSELF ABOUT NEW YORK AND BOSTON I GUESS I'D SHOW HIM THAT NEW YORK ISN'T THE WHOLE WORLD
6064-56165-0005 I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
6064-56165-0006 YOU'RE TERRIBLY NARROW NORA TO THINK THAT NOBODY'S ANY GOOD UNLESS HE COMES FROM BOSTON I DIDN'T SAY SO REPLIED NORA NO BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'M SURPRISED PHILIP BLAIR
6064-56165-0007 WELL YOU'D BETTER TALK BRENDA BARLOW BROKE IN NORA AGAIN JUST SEE THE WAY YOU TREAT JULIA IF SHE'D BEEN BORN IN BOSTON I DON'T TREAT HER INTERRUPTED BRENDA
6064-56165-0008 NO THAT'S JUST IT YOU DON'T TREAT HER DECENTLY
6064-56165-0009 HOW QUEER GIRLS ARE DO YOU ALWAYS FIGHT LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TOGETHER WE DON'T FIGHT LIKE YOU BOYS ANSWERED EDITH GOOD HUMOREDLY WE DON'T KNOCK EACH OTHER DOWN AND RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING ONE ANOTHER'S NOSES
6064-56165-0010 PHILIP LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS OWN SHAPELY NOSE AND I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN ANY SUCH RISK AS EDITH SUGGESTED PERHAPS THIS WAS THE REASON WHY PHILIP WAS NOT A FIGHTER
6064-56165-0011 THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE LITTLE DISPUTES IN WHICH BRENDA AND BELLE INDULGED THEY VERY SELDOM LASTED LONG IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE GIRLS WERE ASHAMED OF HAVING SHOWN TEMPER BEFORE PHILIP
6064-56165-0012 OH SAY DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE TIME WILL HARDON HAD WITH THE DICKY LAST WEEK HE ASKED NORA NODDED SHE TOO HAD A BROTHER IN COLLEGE WHAT WAS IT ASKED EDITH YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME PHILIP
6064-56165-0013 HOW FUNNY YOU ARE EDITH SAID BELLE YOU NEVER HEAR ANYTHING HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YOU HOW THE OTHER FELLOWS MADE HIM RUN BLINDFOLDED IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES DOWN BEACON STREET NO REALLY
6064-56165-0014 AND EVERYBODY LOOKING AT HIM OH SAID ONE GIRL AND AH SAID ANOTHER AND HOW SILLY THEY ALL CRIED TOGETHER IF GIRLS AMUSED THEMSELVES LIKE THAT WHAT FUN YOU'D MAKE OF US SAID THE PRACTICAL NORA
6064-56165-0015 OH IT GIVES A FELLOW A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT KIND OF STUFF HE'S MADE OF EXPLAINED PHILIP WHETHER HE HAS GOOD MANNERS AND WHETHER HE'S CLEVER AND ALL THAT THERE MUST BE BETTER WAYS OF SHOWING BRAVERY
6064-56165-0016 SAID THE PRACTICAL EDITH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WILL HARDON'S BRAVERY THAN YOU DID BEFORE WE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNERS WHAT WHY WHEN HE SAW WHERE HE WAS HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY OR FLUNK OUT
6064-56165-0017 HE ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH THE OTHER FELLOWS SAID
6064-56165-0018 HE WALKED OFF AS NICE AS YOU PLEASE WASN'T HE MAD AT THE TWO FELLOWS FOR TAKING HIM THERE OF COURSE NOT THAT'S A PART OF THE THING WHY THERE ARE FELLOWS IN CAMBRIDGE WHO WOULD GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER
6064-56165-0019 OR STAND ON THEIR HEADS IN FRONT OF A PULPIT FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING INTO THE DICKY I TELL YOU WE MAKE SOME OF THEM SUFFER
6064-56165-0020 ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION A VERY SHORT TIME WELL I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY HORRID CRIED BRENDA I MEAN THE DICKY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WAY YOU MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER BRANDING THEM WITH HOT CIGARS AND MAKING THEM RUN BAREFOOT WINTER NIGHTS AND
6064-56165-0021 THERE ARE A LOT OF GIRLS STUDYING IN CAMBRIDGE NOW AT THE ANNEX AND THE FELLOWS DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL WELL I DECLARE EXCLAIMED NORA I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES TO THEM
6064-56165-0022 OH THEY HATE TO SEE THESE GIRLS GOING ABOUT WITH BOOKS AND TRYING TO GET INTO HARVARD YES TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE WALLS SAID NORA SARCASTICALLY
6064-56165-0023 OH SEE HERE IT WOULD JUST SPOIL EVERYTHING TO HAVE WOMEN IN THE CLASSES WITH US ARE YOU AFRAID THEY'D GET AHEAD OF YOU ASKED EDITH GENTLY NOW LOOK HERE EDITH
6064-56165-0024 INTERRUPTED PHILIP I'VE HEARD THAT SOME PROFESSORS SAY THAT THEIR ANNEX CLASSES DO BETTER WORK THAN OURS BUT ANYBODY CAN TELL THAT THAT'S ALL ROT I BELIEVE IT'S ALL PERFECTLY TRUE SAID NORA
6064-56165-0025 WELL I WISH MYSELF THAT OUR ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR HADN'T SUCH A FONDNESS FOR READING THEMES TO US THAT THE GIRLS HAVE WRITTEN HE MAKES OUT THAT THEY ARE BETTER THAN OURS BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I SEE IT MYSELF WHO GETS THE BEST MARKS
6064-56165-0026 DOES JULIA WEAR GLASSES OR LOOK GREEN I BEG YOUR PARDON BRENDA NO SHE DOESN'T SAID NORA SHORTLY SHE'S ABOUT THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW OH SHE IS LOVELY ADDED EDITH
6064-56165-0027 A MATTER OF OPINION MURMURED BELLE UNDER HER BREATH YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER CRIED BRENDA IN SURPRISE NO I HAVEN'T HAPPENED TO ANSWERED PHILIP
6064-56165-0028 SHE'S INVITED TO MY COOKING PARTY NEXT WEEK SAID NORA YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED TOO SO YOU'LL SEE HER OH YES BY THE WAY SAID PHILIP WHAT EVENING IS IT FRIDAY OF COURSE REPLIED NORA
6064-56165-0029 SO WE CAN SIT UP LATE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY WELL YOU'LL SEE ME SURE SAID PHILIP BUT SEE HERE IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK NOW AND I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT DOWN TOWN
6064-56165-0030 PHILIP HURRIED OFF BOWING IN A VERY GROWN UP WAY TO THE GROUP OF GIRLS FOR WHATEVER CRITICISMS ANY ONE MIGHT MAKE ABOUT PHILIP'S INDOLENCE AND DISINCLINATION TO STUDY NO ONE COULD DENY THAT HE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS
6064-56165-0031 THOUGH ONLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS THEIR SENIOR HE SEEMED MUCH OLDER THAN BRENDA AND HER FRIENDS YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD ALL BEEN PLAYMATES TOGETHER BUT HIS TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE HAD TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM THEM
6064-56165-0032 AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
6064-56165-0033 REPLIED PHILIP'S SISTER IT SEEMED TO ME HE WAS JUST A LITTLE PALE HE IS ALWAYS PALE SAID EDITH DO YOU SUPPOSE HE SITS UP TOO LATE ASKED BRENDA I'LL WARRANT HE DOESN'T STUDY TOO MUCH SAID BELLE
6064-56165-0034 HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE EDITH'S BROTHER DON'T LET HER DO IT EDITH IT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME ANSWERED THE PLACID EDITH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHILIP AND HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THAT'S RIGHT SAID NORA
6064-56165-0035 HE SAYS THERE ARE TWO OR THREE FELLOWS JUST SPONGING OFF OF PHILIP ALL THE TIME AND PHILIP IS TOO GOOD NATURED TO SAY ANYTHING I WONDER HOW HE'LL LIKE JULIA SAID EDITH
6064-56165-0036 HASTILY INTERPOSED BELLE BOYS NEVER LIKE A GIRL WHO STUDIES ESPECIALLY ONE WHO IS GOING TO COLLEGE WELL JULIA IS JUST THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW SAID NORA REPEATING THE WORDS SHE HAD USED TO PHILIP
6064-56168-0000 FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
6064-56168-0001 IT WAS TO BE A GAME WITH PRINCETON ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY MATCHES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS THERE WAS THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE MATCH THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BROTHERS IN COLLEGE OR EVEN COUSINS OR FRIENDS HELD THEMSELVES WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
6064-56168-0002 AND THOSE WHO HAD RELATIVES IN THE TEAM WERE TOO PROUD FOR ANYTHING AS BRENDA SAID THE GAME WAS TO BE PLAYED IN HOLMES FIELD AND TICKETS WERE NOT EASY TO GET BECAUSE THE SEATS WERE FAR LESS NUMEROUS THAN NOW ON THE GREAT SOLDIERS FIELD
6064-56168-0003 THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
6064-56168-0004 WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED ELSEWHERE TO GO IN SOME OTHER PARTY NOW EDITH WAS OF A GENERALLY GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND NOT INCLINED TO LIMIT HER FAVORS OF WHATEVER NATURE TO ANY PARTICULAR SET OF GIRLS
6064-56168-0005 AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY FROM BRENDA BOTH OF WHOM WERE INCLINED TO BE MORE EXCLUSIVE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE GENERAL HARMONY OF THE FOUR WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED WHEN NORA ONE DAY AT RECESS EXCLAIMED WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE IS GOING WITH US TO THE GAME
6064-56168-0006 FOR OF COURSE IN THE MINDS OF THE OTHERS THERE COULD BE BUT ONE GAME
6064-56168-0007 WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON
6064-56168-0008 EXCEPT THAT YOU SPEAK AS IF IT WERE SOME ONE WE MIGHT NOT CARE TO HAVE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD SAID BELLE IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT BROKE IN BRENDA RATHER SNAPPISHLY I WILL JUST TELL EDITH WHAT I THINK
6064-56168-0009 IT THAT CRIED NORA DIDN'T I SAY THAT IT WAS A PERSON A GIRL IF I MUST BE MORE DEFINITE RUTH ROBERTS IF I MUST TELL JUST WHO IT IS OH CRIED BELLE AND AH ECHOED BRENDA
6064-56168-0010 YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO SURPRISED REJOINED NORA AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO EDITH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN ARRANGING HER OWN PARTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE MAKES UP HER MIND IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
6064-56168-0011 IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO HAVE JULIA TAGGING ABOUT EVERYWHERE BUT WHY IN THE WORLD WE SHOULD HAVE RUTH ROBERTS WHEN WE NEVER SEE HER ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT SCHOOL I REALLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOU AND NORA CAN LIKE IT EITHER WHY
6064-56168-0012 RUTH ROBERTS IS AS PLEASANT A GIRL AS THERE IS IN SCHOOL AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE A TERRIBLY LONELY TIME IF IT WERE NOT FOR EDITH AND JULIA NOBODY ELSE EVER THINKS OF SPEAKING TO HER WELL WHY SHOULD WE
6064-56168-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO NORA SMILED PLEASANTLY AND HER EYES LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN EVER UNDER THE RIM OF HER BROWN FELT HAT WITH ITS TRIMMINGS OF LIGHTER BROWN NORA'S TEMPER WAS NOT EASILY RUFFLED
6064-56168-0014 THEN BELLE ADDED A FINAL WORD OH IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS ALL JULIA'S DOINGS
6064-56168-0015 BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
6064-56168-0016 AND ANYWAY I'M THANKFUL TO HAVE JULIA TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IT LEAVES US A GREAT DEAL FREER TO DO AS WE LIKE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOURSELF OH WELL SAID NORA LAUGHING THE WHOLE THING IS NOT WORTH QUARRELING ABOUT
6064-56168-0017 YES I KNOW BUT STILL THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED SAID NORA THOUGH TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH THE QUOTATION DID NOT SOUND ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE THE LEAST SAID THE SOONEST MENDED
6064-56168-0018 I AM GOING TO CARRY AN ORANGE SCARF AND PERHAPS AN ORANGE FLAG WHAT FOR WHY I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EXCLAIMED NORA NOR I CRIED BRENDA AT A HARVARD GAME
6064-56168-0019 I SHOULD CALL IT VERY IMPOLITE IF THERE WERE NO ORANGE FLAGS SHOWN AT THE GAME WELL YOU HAVE THE MOST RIDICULOUS IDEAS HASN'T SHE BRENDA BRENDA NODDED ASSENT AND NORA CONTINUED
6064-56168-0020 WHY IT'S A DUTY TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP YOUR OWN SIDE I NEVER SAID THAT HARVARD WAS MY SIDE INTERRUPTED BELLE DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A COUSIN ON THE PRINCETON TEAM YOU'D BETTER NOT SAY ANYTHING OF THAT KIND TO PHILIP
6064-56168-0021 OR TO EDITH EITHER THEY ARE BOTH PERFECTLY DEVOTED TO HARVARD AND THEY EXPECT THEIR PARTY TO GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HARVARD TEAM WHY BELLE I CANNOT IMAGINE YOUR DOING ANYTHING ELSE I'M NOT A CHILD RESPONDED BELLE VERY CROSSLY
6064-56168-0022 WALKING AWAY FROM NORA AND BRENDA I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHAT NORA OR BRENDA MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED I CANNOT SAY FOR HARDLY HAD BELLE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN EDITH HERSELF APPEARED WITH JULIA AND RUTH
6064-56168-0023 RUTH WAS A PRETTY AND AMIABLE GIRL ABOUT JULIA'S AGE AND THEREFORE A LITTLE OLDER THAN THE FOUR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE COMING OF JULIA BUT IN ALL THAT TIME SHE HAD HAD ONLY A SPEAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE OTHER GIRLS
6064-56168-0024 THAT THEY WERE VERY SELFISH IN LEAVING THEIR SCHOOLMATE SO ENTIRELY TO HERSELF IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LIKE HER THEY WERE MERELY SO VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THAT THEY HARDLY NOTICED THAT SHE WAS OFTEN LEFT TO HERSELF
6064-56168-0025 RUTH LIVED IN THE SUBURBS AND AS BELLE HAD SAID OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL THE OTHER GIRLS SELDOM SAW HER AT RECESS EACH LITTLE GROUP HAD SO MANY PERSONAL THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT AN OUTSIDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY
6064-56168-0026 AND WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE IN JOINING THEM NO ONE GETS A GREAT DEAL OF ENJOYMENT FROM READING A SINGLE CHAPTER IN THE MIDDLE OF A BOOK AND SO IT IS OFTEN HARD TO BE A MERE LISTENER
6064-56168-0027 WHEN THE TONGUES OF HALF A DOZEN GIRLS ARE VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSING PEOPLE AND EVENTS OF WHICH THE LISTENER HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST KNOWLEDGE RUTH HERSELF WAS VERY INDEPENDENT
6064-56168-0028 SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF STUDYING DURING RECESS SINCE AFTER SCHOOL SHE SPENT MORE TIME THAN MOST GIRLS OF HER AGE IN OUTDOOR SPORTS IT DID HER NO GREAT HARM TO PASS THE HALF HOUR OF RECESS IN THIS WAY RUTH AS WELL AS JULIA
6064-56168-0029 HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE AND IT HAD BEEN A GREAT DELIGHT TO HER TO HAVE THE LATTER PLACED WITH HER IN ONE OR TWO SPECIAL CLASSES JULIA'S LIKING FOR HER HAD MADE EDITH TAKE A LITTLE MORE INTEREST IN HER THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
6064-56168-0030 NO ONE WHO SAW THE HEARTY WAY IN WHICH NORA AND BRENDA GREETED RUTH AS SHE CAME UP WITH EDITH AND JULIA COULD FOR A MOMENT HAVE IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION THE MERCURIAL BRENDA FOR THE MOMENT
6064-56168-0031 WAS SO ANNOYED BY BELLE'S PROPOSED CHAMPIONSHIP OF PRINCETON THAT SHE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CORDIAL TO RUTH AND ALMOST TO HER OWN SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF URGING RUTH TO COME TO TOWN EARLY ON THE SATURDAY OF THE GAME TO TAKE LUNCHEON WITH HER AND JULIA
6064-56168-0032 THE LATTER EXPRESSED HER THANKS IN A GLANCE TOWARDS HER COUSIN AS RUTH ACCEPTED VERY GRACEFULLY AND NORA EXCLAIMED WHAT FUN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
6064-56168-0033 OH DEAR I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SATURDAY I KNOW IT REPLIED BRENDA IT'S LESS THAN A WEEK TOO BUT IT SEEMS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME
7078-271888-0000 WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
7078-271888-0001 WITH HER BACK TO A GREAT CIRCULAR MIRROR PRESENTS A HALF DRAPED FIGURE OF MARVELLOUS DELICATE COLOURING AND BEAUTY OF OUTLINE ONE HAND HOLDS ALOFT A GOLDEN WINE GOBLET AND THE OTHER A TAPERING WAND
7078-271888-0002 WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
7078-271888-0003 BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
7078-271888-0004 OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
7078-271888-0005 UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
7078-271888-0006 IS ON CAMPDEN HILL KENSINGTON WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF WHERE I RESIDE AND IN THE CENTRE OF AN AESTHETIC ARTISTIC COLONY WE HAVE BEEN CHUMS FOR YEARS FOR ON MANY OCCASIONS HE HAS DISPLAYED HIS TALENT AS A BLACK AND WHITE ARTIST
7078-271888-0007 IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
7078-271888-0008 HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
7078-271888-0009 HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
7078-271888-0010 AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
7078-271888-0011 THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURED FACE BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF DAYS LONG PAST OF A CLOSED CHAPTER IN MY LIFE'S HISTORY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME I SAW ETHEL BROUGHTON FULLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WORE A SOILED PINK WRAPPER
7078-271888-0012 HER SATIN SLIPPERS WERE TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AT HER ELBOW AT THAT TIME HER LOVER GRANDILOQUENT AND IMPECUNIOUS MISTER HARRY ORANMORE A BAD BUT HANDSOME ACTOR HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HER
7078-271888-0013 AND SHE A THIRD RATE ACTRESS WHO HAD AN INGENUE PART AT A STRAND THEATRE
7078-271888-0014 BUT SHE SCARCELY HEEDED ME PROBABLY SHE WAS THINKING OF ORANMORE FOR SHE CLASPED HER SLIM FINGERS ROUND HER SUFFERING THROAT AND OFFERED UP AN OCCASIONAL SOB FOLLOWING IT WITH A SILENT BUT PROTRACTED DRAUGHT FROM HER GLASS
7078-271888-0015 THE RESULT OF THIS INTERVIEW WAS BUT NATURAL DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY I SYMPATHISED WITH HER ENDEAVOURED TO CHEER HER AND CONCLUDED BY FALLING VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH HER AT THAT TIME I WAS WRITING NUMBERS OF DRAMATIC CRITICISMS
7078-271888-0016 AND I CONFESS I USED WHAT WEIGHT MY OPINIONS POSSESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HER ADVANCEMENT IT IS NEEDLESS TO REFER TO THE SMOOTH AND UNINTERRUPTED COURSE OF OUR LOVE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE WERE BOTH BOHEMIANS
7078-271888-0017 AND THAT WITHIN A YEAR I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SITTING BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS WATCHING HER MAKE HER DEBUT AS LEADING LADY AT A WEST END THEATRE AND A FEW DAYS LATER OF OBSERVING HER PHOTOGRAPH EXHIBITED IN SHOP WINDOWS AMONG THOSE OF OTHER STAGE BEAUTIES
7078-271888-0018 BUT ALAS THOSE HALCYON DAYS WERE ALL TOO BRIEF SUDDENLY THE SCALES FELL FROM MY EYES A SCENE OCCURRED BETWEEN US AND WE PARTED TO THINK THAT SIN SHOULD LIE FOR YEARS IN THE BLOOD
7078-271888-0019 JUST AS ARSENIC DOES IN A CORPSE WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT DICK CARRUTHERS WAS WASTING THE VERY HONEST AND ARDENT EMOTIONS OF HIS HEART AT THIS FEVERISH FAIRY'S SHRINE I RESOLVED TO TAKE HIM ASIDE AND WITHOUT ADMITTING THAT I KNEW HER
7078-271888-0020 GIVE HIM A VERBAL DRUBBING I DID SO BUT HE BIT HIS MOUSTACHE FIERCELY AND TURNED UPON ME SHE IS CHARMING HE SAID AND I LOVE HER AH I KNOW THE TYPE
7078-271888-0021 YOU KNOW NOTHING OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING ANGRILY BUT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
7078-271888-0022 YOU SHALL SEE HER BEFORE LONG HIS GAZE GREW BRIGHT SOFT AND VAGUE AS ONE WHO CATCHES GLIMPSES OF THE FLOATING GARMENTS OF SUPERNATURAL MYSTERIES AH SHE IS LOVELY ONLY AN ARTIST CAN APPRECIATE HER BEAUTY
7078-271888-0023 HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE SPELL SHE HAD CAST ABOUT HIM ONE NIGHT NOT LONG AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED MY SENTIMENTS TO HIM REGARDING HIS INFATUATION I ENTERED HIS STUDIO AND FOUND HIS GODDESS SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH HER SHAPELY FEET UPON THE FENDER
7078-271888-0024 AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
7078-271888-0025 I CAUGHT HER GLANCING FURTIVELY AT ME UNDER HER LONG LASHES SHE HAD GROWN EVEN HANDSOMER THAN WHEN LAST I HAD SEEN HER AND WAS THE PICTURE OF THE ROMANTIC BOHEMIENNE HER DRESS WAS OF BLACK GAUZE THROUGH WHICH THE MILKY WHITENESS OF HER FIGURE SEEMED TO SHINE
7078-271888-0026 YET AS SHE TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE TOWARDS ME I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL FRAILTY THAT SHE PRESENTED SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AT MEETING ME REMARKING THAT SHE HAD READ MY LAST NOVEL AND HAD BEEN KEENLY INTERESTED IN IT
7078-271888-0027 WHEN I HAD BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT SHE PAID ME SHE SAID ONE THING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN READING YOUR STORIES YOUR WOMEN ARE INEVITABLY FALSE AND FICKLE PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU WRITE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
7078-271888-0028 OF THE FAILINGS OF MY SEX SHE LAUGHED GLANCING SHARPLY AT HER I SAW THAT HER EYES DID NOT WAVER IT IS TRUE I ONCE KNEW A WOMAN WHO PROVED FALSE AND INFAMOUS I REPLIED WITH SOME EMPHASIS
7078-271888-0029 AND YOU AVENGE YOURSELF BY REVILING ALL OF US IT IS REALLY TOO BAD SHE SAID POUTING LIKE A SPOILED CHILD BY JOVE OLD FELLOW DICK CHIMED IN DO TELL US ABOUT YOUR ROMANCE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THE REASON
7078-271888-0030 YOU SET YOUR FACE AGAINST ALL THE FAIR ONES BUT I SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
7078-271888-0031 SO MAKING AN EXCUSE I BADE THEM AU REVOIR AND RETURNED TO MY OWN BOOK LINED DEN UNLOCKING A DRAWER IN MY WRITING TABLE I TOOK OUT A PACKET OF LETTERS THAT STILL EMITTED A STALE ODOUR OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0032 THEN I LIT MY PIPE AND ONE BY ONE READ THEM THROUGH PAUSING AND PONDERING OVER THE DECLARATIONS OF PASSIONATE LOVE THEY CONTAINED FAR INTO THE NIGHT I SAT REVIEWING THE ROMANCE OF BYGONE DAYS UNTIL I CAME TO THE LAST LETTER
7078-271888-0033 IT WAS A COLD FORMAL NOTE MERELY A FEW LINES OF HURRIED SCRAWL AND READ YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE BEEN FALSE TO YOU THINK NO MORE OF ME BY THE TIME YOU RECEIVE THIS I SHALL BE ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK
7078-271888-0034 NEVERTHELESS YOU WILL BE ALWAYS REMEMBERED BY YOURS UNWORTHILY ETHEL BITTER MEMORIES OF THE PAST OVERWHELMED ME BUT AT LAST GROWING IMPATIENT AND TOSSING THE LETTERS BACK INTO THE DRAWER
7078-271888-0035 I STROVE TO FORGET THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK TWO AND MY READING LAMP WAS BURNING LOW AND SPUTTERING WHEN I ROSE TO RETIRE FOR THE NIGHT I CONFESS THAT MY FRAME OF MIND SURPRISED ME INASMUCH AS I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF
7078-271888-0036 STILL LOVING HER GOOD AFTERNOON I HOPE I DON'T DISTURB YOU LOOKING UP FROM MY WORK I SAW ETHEL NOT AT ALL PRAY SIT DOWN I SAID COLDLY
7078-271888-0037 MOTIONING HER TO AN ARMCHAIR TO WHAT DO I OWE THE HONOUR OF THIS VISIT SHE PULLED OFF HER LONG GLOVES AND LET HER SEALSKIN CAPE FALL AT HER FEET WHILE I PUT DOWN MY PEN AND RISING STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE FIRE
7078-271888-0038 WITH HER SHE HAD BROUGHT THE ODOUR OF VIOLETS THE SAME THAT I REMEMBERED YEARS AGO THE SAME PERFUME THAT ALWAYS STIRRED SAD MEMORIES WITHIN ME YOU DON'T WELCOME ME VERY WARMLY SHE SAID IN A DISAPPOINTED TONE
7078-271888-0039 AS SHE GRASPED MY HAND AND LOOKED STEADILY INTO MY EYES NO I SAID STERNLY LAST NIGHT I TOLD YOU THAT A WOMAN HAD EMBITTERED MY LIFE THE WOMAN I REFERRED TO WAS YOURSELF AH
7078-271888-0040 SHE SAID STRIVING TO SUPPRESS A SOB FORGIVE ME I I WAS MAD THEN I LOVED YOU BUT I DID NOT APPREHEND THE CONSEQUENCE LOVE WHAT NONSENSE TO SPEAK OF IT WHEN THROUGH YOUR BASENESS
7078-271888-0041 I HAVE BEEN ALMOST RUINED THINK OF YOUR ACTIONS ON THE DAY BEFORE YOU LEFT ME HOW YOU TOOK FROM THAT DRAWER A SIGNED BLANK CHEQUE WITH WHICH YOU DREW SIX HUNDRED POUNDS NEARLY ALL THE MONEY I POSSESSED AND THEN FLED WITH YOUR LOVER
7078-271888-0042 IS THAT THE WAY A WOMAN SHOWS HER AFFECTION HER HEAD WAS BOWED IN HUMILIATION FORGIVE ME HAROLD SHE SAID WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS I ADMIT THAT I WRONGED YOU CRUELLY THAT I DISCARDED THE HONEST LOVE YOU GAVE ME
7078-271888-0043 BUT YOU YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW WEAK WE WOMEN ARE WHEN TEMPTATION IS IN OUR PATH CANNOT I NOW MAKE AMENDS I SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
7078-271888-0044 SHE IMPLORED TEARFULLY AT LEAST I AM HONEST MY OBJECT IN COMING THIS AFTERNOON WAS TO REPAY THE MONEY I I BORROWED
7078-271888-0045 I ASKED HESITATING TO RECEIVE IT I HAVE EARNED IT HONESTLY EVERY PENNY SHE REPLIED SINCE WE PARTED I HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN AMERICA AND PLAYED LEAD IN NEARLY ALL THE GREAT CITIES
7078-271888-0046 DURING THE YEARS THAT HAVE GONE I HAVE MANY MANY TIMES WONDERED WHAT HAD BECOME OF YOU FOR IN YOUR WRITINGS I READ PLAINLY HOW SOURED AND EMBITTERED YOU HAD BECOME AND WHERE IS ORANMORE DEAD
7078-271888-0047 HE CONTRACTED TYPHOID WHILE WE WERE PLAYING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT TERMINATED FATALLY ETHEL I SAID GRAVELY TAKING HER HAND IN MINE YOU HAVE FASCINATED DICK CARRUTHERS MY FRIEND
7078-271888-0048 AND YOU WILL TREAT HIM AS YOU TREATED ME NO NO I LOVE HIM SHE SAID IN A FIERCE HALF WHISPER ADDING
7078-271888-0049 I WILL BE TRUE TO HIM IF HE MARRIES ME HE SHALL NEVER HAVE CAUSE FOR REGRET NEVER SUPPOSE I TOLD HIM WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF YOU YOU WILL NOT SHE CRIED CLINGING TO ME YOU ARE TOO HONOURABLE FOR THAT
7078-271888-0050 PROMISE TO KEEP MY SECRET FOR THE PRESENT I WILL PRESERVE SILENCE I ANSWERED MY HEART SOFTENING TOWARDS HER BUT I CANNOT PROMISE THAT I WILL NEVER TELL HIM
7078-271888-0051 WHAT CHARACTER DO YOU THINK WOULD BEST SUIT ME WELL
7078-271888-0052 THE WOMAN WHO BROKE MEN'S HEARTS I REPLIED MISCHIEVOUSLY EXCELLENT I SHALL BE ABLE TO ASSUME THAT CHARACTER WELL SHE SAID WITH A GRIM SMILE I WILL TELL HIM SPRING CAME AND WENT
7078-271888-0053 BUT I SAW VERY LITTLE OF DICK HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMISSION FROM ONE OF THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS TO MAKE A SERIES OF SKETCHES OF SCENERY IN SCOTLAND
7078-271888-0054 WHENEVER HE PAID FLYING VISITS TO LONDON HOWEVER HE ALWAYS LOOKED ME UP BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH NEVER MENTIONED ETHEL NEVERTHELESS I ASCERTAINED THAT THEY FREQUENTLY MET
7078-271888-0055 AT THE CLOSE OF A BLUE SUMMER'S DAY WHEN THE DREAMY GOLDEN HAZE WRAPPED THE CITY IN A MYSTIC CHARM I CALLED AT THE STUDIO HAVING HEARD THAT HE HAD RETURNED AND WAS SETTLING DOWN TO WORK WHEN I ENTERED DICK WAS STANDING BEFORE HIS EASEL
7078-271888-0056 PIPE IN MOUTH AND CRAYON IN HAND BUSILY SKETCHING WHILE ON THE RAISED THRONE BEFORE HIM SAT ETHEL RADIANT AND BEAUTIFUL A TENDER SMILE PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT SEEMED AS THOUGH A HAPPINESS FULL COMPLETE
7078-271888-0057 PERFECTLY SATISFYING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HERSELF OUT OF THE WORLD EVEN WELCOME OLD FELLOW DICK CRIED
7078-271888-0058 ETHEL WILL NOT SIT FOR ANY OTHER SUBJECT IT HARDLY DOES HER JUSTICE DOES IT IT IS A STRANGE FANCY OF MINE SHE EXPLAINED WHEN I HAD GREETED HER I'M SURE THE DRESS IS VERY BECOMING ISN'T IT
7078-271888-0059 AND SHE WAVED THE GOBLET SHE WAS HOLDING ABOVE HER HEAD YOUR POSE IS PERFECT DEAR PLEASE DON'T ALTER IT URGED THE ARTIST WHO ADVANCING TO HIS EASEL AGAIN CONTINUED THE FREE RAPID OUTLINE
7078-271888-0060 PRESENTLY SHE REAPPEARED AND WE WENT TO DINE TOGETHER AT A RESTAURANT IN PICCADILLY AFTERWARDS VISITING A THEATRE AND SPENDING A VERY PLEASANT EVENING POOR DICK I WAS SORRY THAT HE WAS SO INFATUATED
7078-271888-0061 HE WAS SUCH A LARGE HEARTED HONEST FELLOW THAT I FELT QUITE PAINED WHEN I ANTICIPATED THE AWAKENING THAT MUST INEVITABLY COME SOONER OR LATER HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF HER PAST AND WAS QUITE IGNORANT THAT SHE HAD BEEN A POPULAR ACTRESS
7078-271888-0062 IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED I VISITED THE STUDIO ALMOST DAILY AND WATCHED THE GROWTH OF THE PICTURE
7078-271888-0063 THE DELICATE TINTS OF THE NECK AND ARMS WERE REPRODUCED WITH A SKILL THAT BETRAYED THE MASTER HAND
7078-271888-0064 I RETURNED HOME FROM A STROLL ACROSS KENSINGTON GARDENS
7078-271888-0065 HEARD SOME ONE PLAYING UPON MY PIANO AND A SWEET SOPRANO VOICE SINGING TROTERE'S IN OLD MADRID I RECOGNISED THE CLEAR TONES AS THOSE OF ETHEL AH HAROLD SHE CRIED JUMPING UP AS I ENTERED THE ROOM

7078-271888-0068 I HAVE REFUSED REFUSED WHY FOR REASONS OF MY OWN
7078-271888-0069 IF IF HE SPEAKS TO YOU URGE HIM TO ABANDON THOUGHTS OF LOVE AND REGARD ME AS A FRIEND ONLY YOU ARE AT LEAST SENSIBLE ETHEL I SAID IT IS GRATIFYING TO KNOW THAT YOU RECOGNISE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN UNION
7078-271888-0070 TEARS WELLED IN HER EYES SHE NODDED BUT DID NOT REPLY A DRY GREY DAY IN MARCH IT WAS SHOW SUNDAY THAT INSTITUTION IN THE ART WORLD WHEN THE PAINTER OPENS HIS STUDIO TO HIS FRIENDS AND THE PUBLIC
7078-271888-0071 TO SHOW THEM THE PICTURE HE IS ABOUT TO SEND TO THE ACADEMY THE EXHIBITION IS IN MANY INSTANCES BUT THE SHOWING BEFOREHAND OF THE GARLANDS OF VICTORY IN A BATTLE WHICH IS DOOMED TO BE LOST FOR WHEN THE OPENING DAY COMES
7078-271888-0072 HAS NO SUCH ORDEAL TO FACE HE NEVER READS HIS NEW ROMANCE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR DO HIS WELL WISHERS APPLAUD IN ADVANCE REVIEWERS HAVE FIRST TILT AT ADVANCE COPIES AND VERY PROPERLY
7078-271888-0073 FROM MORN TILL EVE ON SHOW SUNDAY CAMPDEN HILL IS ALWAYS BLOCKED BY THE CARRIAGES OF THE CURIOUS AND STUDIOS ARE BESIEGED BY FASHIONABLE CROWDS WHOSE CHATTER AND LAUGHTER MINGLES PLEASANTLY WITH THE CLINKING OF TEA CUPS
7078-271888-0074 ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
7078-271888-0075 THE OPINIONS OF CRITICS WHO DROPPED IN WERE UNANIMOUS THAT IT WAS THE ARTIST'S MASTERPIECE AND THAT THE EXPRESSION AND GENERAL CONCEPTION WERE MARVELLOUS A VERDICT ENDORSED BY GUSHING SOCIETY WOMEN BORED CLUB MEN AND THE INANE JEUNESSE DOREE
7078-271888-0076 A SCRAP OF CONVERSATION I OVERHEARD IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON HOWEVER CAUSED ME TO PONDER AN ELDERLY MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER WEARING THE VIOLET RIBBON OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
7078-271888-0077 WAS STANDING WITH A YOUNG GIRL IN THE CROWD AROUND THE EASEL WHY LOOK PAPA THAT FACE THE GIRL CRIED WHEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE CANVAS IT IS HER PORTRAIT SURELY THE SIGNORE CANNOT KNOW DIO
7078-271888-0078 EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY RECOGNISING THE FEATURES THE PICTURE IS INDEED MAGNIFICENT
7078-271888-0079 COME AWAY ZELIE LET US GO I HEARD NO MORE FOR THEY TURNED AND LEFT HAVING ACTED AS EAVESDROPPER I COULD HARDLY QUESTION THEM NEVERTHELESS I WAS SORELY PUZZLED LOOK READ THAT
7078-271888-0080 IN SURPRISE I GLANCED UP FROM MY WORK OF ROMANCE WEAVING ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND SAW DICK PALE AND AGITATED STANDING AT MY ELBOW THE LETTER HE PLACED BEFORE ME WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND EMITTED THE FAINTEST BREATH OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0081 A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN
7078-271888-0082 I AM GOING FAR AWAY WHERE YOU CANNOT FIND ME IT WAS FOOLISH FOR US TO HAVE LOVED THEREFORE FORGET ME THAT YOU MAY MEET SOME ONE FAR WORTHIER THAN MYSELF
7078-271888-0083 MAY BRING YOU FAME AND FORTUNE IS THE MOST SINCERE HOPE OF YOUR MODELS ETHEL I WARNED YOU AGAINST YOUR INFATUATION OLD FELLOW I SAID SERIOUSLY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT I I LOVED HER
7078-271888-0084 WHILE HIS FACE ASSUMED A HARD DETERMINED EXPRESSION
7078-271888-0085 AND SHE HAD HER FOOT UPON MY NECK BUT IT IS ALL OVER HE ADDED BITTERLY I SHALL THINK NO MORE OF HER THEN HE WISHED ME AN ABRUPT FAREWELL AND LEFT
7078-271888-0086 THAT EVENING I CALLED AT DICK'S HOUSE BUT WAS INFORMED BY HIS HOUSEKEEPER THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS BAG AND DEPARTED STATING THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN FOR AT LEAST A MONTH PERHAPS LONGER WHEN I ENTERED THE STUDIO GLOOMY IN THE TWILIGHT
7078-271888-0087 AND THAT IT WAS STANDING IN A CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
7078-271888-0088 AND WHEN I DID SO I DISCOVERED TO MY DISMAY THAT IN HIS FRENZY OF MAD DESPAIR
7078-271888-0089 AND DRAWN IT ACROSS THE FACE MAKING A GREAT UGLY DISFIGURING DAUB OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS UTTERLY RUINING THE FEATURES AND PRODUCING A CURIOUSLY FORBIDDING EFFECT THE COLOUR WAS NOT DRY
7078-271888-0090 THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
7078-271888-0091 THE LIMIT FOR SENDING IN TO THE ACADEMY WAS APPROACHING BUT DICK DID NOT WRITE AND I COULD ONLY WONDER VAGUELY WHERE HE WAS WANDERING IT WAS A GREAT PITY I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A FINE WORK SHOULD NOT BE EXHIBITED
7078-271888-0092 YET THE WILFUL OBLITERATION HAD UTTERLY SPOILED IT WHILE SITTING IN HIS STUDIO MUSING ONE DAY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE FLAW UPON THE FOREHEAD COULD BE HIDDEN IT MIGHT AFTER ALL BE SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE
7078-271888-0093 TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
7078-271888-0094 ENABLED ME TO PAINT IN THE HALF LIGHTS UPON THE BLACK SILK AND THE LAUGHING EYES BEING FORTUNATELY INTACT I ALLOWED THEM TO PEER THROUGH THE APERTURES THE EFFECT PRODUCED WAS STARTLING
7078-271888-0095 THE MASK SEEMED TO INCREASE THE RECKLESS DIABLERIE OF ITS WEARER AND ENHANCE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPLEXION WHILE IT ADDED AN AIR OF MYSTERY NOT AT ALL UNPLEASING TO THE EYE A FEW DAYS LATER I DISPATCHED IT TO THE ACADEMY
7078-271888-0096 AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPENING DAY WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE MINGLED SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION OF SEEING IT HUNG UPON THE LINE
7078-271888-0097 WAS PRONOUNCED ONE OF THE PICTURES OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS ADMIRED IT THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF LAUDATORY NOTICES BUT THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT UNAWARE OF THE FAME HE HAD SUDDENLY ACHIEVED WAS HIDING HIS SORROW SOMEWHERE IN THE VOSGES
7078-271888-0098 A STRAY COPY OF AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER CONTAINING A NOTICE OF HIS WORK WHICH DICK PICKED UP IN A HOTEL HOWEVER CAUSED HIM TO RETURN HE BURST INTO MY ROOM UNCEREMONIOUSLY ONE MORNING STILL ATTIRED IN HIS TRAVELLING ULSTER
7078-271888-0099 I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB
7078-271888-0100 IT SEEMS THAT THE PUBLIC ADMIRE HER AS MUCH AS I HAVE DONE I I SHALL FIND HER SOME DAY THEN SHE WILL RETURN TO ME STILL THINKING OF HER I OBSERVED REPROACHFULLY YES ALWAYS
7078-271888-0101 ALWAYS HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY I I CANNOT FORGET DICK'S POPULARITY STEADILY INCREASED LUCRATIVE COMMISSIONS POURED IN UPON HIM AND HE SETTLED DOWN TO SUCH HARD
7078-271888-0102 METHODICAL WORK THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WOMAN WHO HAD ENMESHED HIM WITH BEAMING FACE HE CAME TO ME ONE SUMMER'S MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE OF THE CHANTREY BEQUEST HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE THE MASKED CIRCE HE
7078-271888-0103 THE WELL KNOWN ANGLO ITALIAN MILLIONAIRE AND ART PATRON SAYING THAT HE DESIRED TO BUY IT AND ASKING HIM TO GO DOWN TO OXTED PARK HIS SEAT IN SURREY TO ARRANGE THE PRICE I AM GOING TO DAY HE SAID YOU MASKED HER
7078-271888-0104 AND CONGRATULATED DICK WARMLY UPON HIS MASTERPIECE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE MEANT TO SECURE IT AT ANY COST
7078-271888-0105 MY COMPANION HAD A CHEQUE FOR FOUR FIGURES IN HIS POCKET WE WERE ABOUT TO MAKE OUR ADIEUX BUT THE COUNT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT DINNER WILL BE READY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE SAID YOU MUST STAY
7078-271888-0106 AH HERE'S THE COUNTESS EXCLAIMED THE MILLIONAIRE STEPPING FORWARD TO INTRODUCE US WE TURNED AND SAW A PALE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ATTIRED IN A HANDSOME DINNER GOWN ETHEL YOU
7078-271888-0107 WE BOTH CRIED IN AMAZEMENT DICK SHE GASPED YOU YOU HAVE FOUND ME SHE REELED BACKWARDS AND BEFORE WE COULD SAVE HER FELL SENSELESS TO THE FLOOR A FEW WORDS OF EXCUSE
7078-271888-0108 AND EXPLANATION AND WE LEFT THE COUNT WHO KNEELING BESIDE HIS WIFE AND ENDEAVOURING TO RESUSCITATE HER WAS COMPLETELY MYSTIFIED AT THE STRANGE RECOGNITION DICK ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH GRIEF
7078-271888-0109 AT DISCOVERING HIS IDOL ALREADY MARRIED RETURNED AT ONCE TO LONDON WHILE I REMAINED AT AN INN AT OXTED IN ORDER TO GLEAN SOME FURTHER INFORMATION INQUIRIES SHOWED THAT THE COUNT HAD MET HER WHILE TRAVELLING IN AMERICA
7078-271888-0110 TO INQUIRE AFTER THE COUNTESS'S HEALTH THE FOOTMAN LOOKED PALE AND GRAVE WHEN I ASKED AFTER HER LADYSHIP I MUCH REGRET TO INFORM YOU SIR THAT MY MISTRESS IS DEAD HE SAID
7078-271888-0111 DEAD I CRIED IMPOSSIBLE YES SIR HER MAID DISCOVERED HER IN HER BOUDOIR LATE LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF MORPHIA WE SENT FOR THE DOCTOR
7078-271888-0112 BUT BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL LIFE WAS EXTINCT THE COUNT IS INSANE WITH GRIEF MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MAID DISCOVERED THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD LEFT A LETTER TO SOME MAN SHE CALLS DICK TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM
7078-271888-0113 AND COULD LIVE NO LONGER DICK RARELY SMILES AND IS INVARIABLY GLOOMY AND SAD POOR FELLOW THE COUNT IGNORANT OF THE TRUTH HAS HUNG HIS LATEST PURCHASE
7078-271888-0114 IN THE PRIVATE GALLERY OF HIS GREAT PALACE IN ROME LITTLE DREAMING THAT
8609-283227-0000 HE AND ANOTHER FARMER HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD BEEN SO OFTEN RE ELECTED CHURCHWARDENS THAT AT LAST THEY SEEMED TO HAVE GAINED A PRESCRIPTIVE RIGHT TO THE OFFICE AND THE FORM OF ELECTION FELL INTO DISUSE
8609-283227-0001 BEEN SAID ABOUT THE ELECTION OF A COLLEAGUE SO LITTLE SEEMED TO FALL TO THE DUTY OF THE CHURCHWARDEN THAT I REGARDED THE NEGLECT AS A TRIFLE AND WAS REMISS IN SETTING IT RIGHT I HAD THEREFORE TO SUFFER AS WAS JUST INDEED MISTER BROWNRIGG WAS NOT THE MAN TO HAVE POWER IN HIS HANDS UNCHECKED
8609-283227-0002 I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
8609-283227-0003 CONFIDENT THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND SO TOLD MISSUS PEARSON TO SHOW HIM IN OH SIR I KNOW YOU WOULD BE VEXED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN TOLD HE EXCLAIMED AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR TROUBLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER TOM I SAID
8609-283227-0004 WHICH WERE NECESSARY AND MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANOTHER WINTER I CONFESS I WAS RATHER PLEASED FOR I WANTED MY PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE CHURCH WAS THEIR PROPERTY AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PRIVILEGE IF THEY COULD REGARD IT AS A BLESSING TO HAVE THE CHURCH TO KEEP IT IN DECENT ORDER AND REPAIR
8609-283227-0005 TO MY CHURCHWARDEN WE MUST CALL A VESTRY BEFORE LONG AND HAVE THIS LOOKED TO NOW MY PREDECESSOR HAD LEFT EVERYTHING OF THE KIND TO HIS CHURCHWARDENS AND THE INHABITANTS FROM THEIR SIDE HAD LIKEWISE LEFT THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE CHURCHWARDENS BUT MISTER BROWNRIGG
8609-283227-0006 WHO I MUST SAY HAD TAKEN MORE PAINS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LEGALITIES OF HIS OFFICE DID NOT FAIL TO CALL A VESTRY TO WHICH AS USUAL NO ONE HAD RESPONDED WHEREUPON HE IMPOSED A RATE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT THIS I BELIEVE
8609-283227-0007 HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
8609-283227-0008 THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
8609-283227-0009 AMONGST WHOM WERE THE FAMILIES OF TWO OR THREE FARMERS OF SUBSTANCE WHILE THE VILLAGE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTRIBUTED A PORTION OF THE POOREST OF THE INHABITANTS A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE I CAME THEIR MINISTER DIED AND THEY HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER A VERY WORTHY MAN OF CONSIDERABLE ERUDITION
8609-283227-0010 BUT OF EXTREME VIEWS AS I HEARD UPON INSIGNIFICANT POINTS AND MOVED BY A GREAT DISLIKE TO NATIONAL CHURCHES AND EPISCOPACY THIS I SAY IS WHAT I HAD MADE OUT ABOUT HIM FROM WHAT I HAD HEARD
8609-283227-0011 AND MY READER WILL VERY PROBABLY BE INCLINED TO ASK BUT WHY WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS YOURS SHOULD YOU HAVE ONLY HEARSAY TO GO UPON WHY DID YOU NOT MAKE THE HONEST MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE IN SUCH A SMALL PLACE MEN SHOULD NOT KEEP EACH OTHER AT ARM'S LENGTH
8609-283227-0012 AND ANY READER WHO SAYS SO WILL SAY RIGHT ALL I HAVE TO SUGGEST FOR MYSELF IS SIMPLY A CERTAIN SHYNESS FOR WHICH I CANNOT ENTIRELY ACCOUNT BUT WHICH WAS PARTLY MADE UP OF FEAR TO INTRUDE OR OF BEING SUPPOSED TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE RIGHT OF MAKING ADVANCES
8609-283227-0013 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0014 MISTER TEMPLETON THEN HAD REFUSED AS A POINT OF CONSCIENCE TO PAY THE CHURCH RATE WHEN THE COLLECTOR WENT ROUND TO DEMAND IT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SUFFERED A DEFAULT AND PROCEEDINGS BEING PUSHED FROM THE FIRST IN ALL THE PRIDE OF MISTER BROWNRIGG'S LEGALITY
8609-283227-0015 HAD ON THIS VERY DAY BEEN VISITED BY THE CHURCHWARDEN ACCOMPANIED BY A BROKER FROM THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN OF ADDICEHEAD AND AT THE VERY TIME WHEN I WAS HEARING OF THE FACT WAS SUFFERING DISTRAINT OF HIS GOODS THE PORCINE HEAD OF THE CHURCHWARDEN WAS NOT ON HIS SHOULDERS BY ACCIDENT NOR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE
8609-283227-0016 BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS NOW IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT TOM BORE WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT MOMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE THUS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITY I RANG THE BELL FOR MY BOOTS AND TO THE OPEN MOUTHED DISMAY OF MISSUS PEARSON LEFT THE VICARAGE LEANING ON TOM'S ARM
8609-283227-0017 BUT SUCH WAS THE COMMOTION IN MY MIND THAT I HAD BECOME QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ILLNESS OR EVEN FEEBLENESS HURRYING ON IN MORE TERROR THAN I CAN WELL EXPRESS LEST I SHOULD BE TOO LATE I REACHED MISTER TEMPLETON'S HOUSE JUST AS A SMALL MAHOGANY TABLE WAS BEING HOISTED INTO A SPRING CART
8609-283227-0018 WHICH STOOD AT THE DOOR BREATHLESS WITH HASTE I WAS YET ABLE TO CALL OUT PUT THAT TABLE DOWN DIRECTLY AT THE SAME MOMENT MISTER BROWNRIGG APPEARED FROM WITHIN THE DOOR
8609-283227-0019 I THINK HE HAD NOT HEARD ME YOU SEE I'M PROMPT MISTER WALTON HE SAID BUT BLESS MY SOUL HOW ILL YOU LOOK WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM FOR I WAS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN I REPEATED PUT THAT TABLE DOWN I TELL YOU THEY DID SO
8609-283227-0020 NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
8609-283227-0021 I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT I BELIEVE I HAD THE RIGHT TO BE CHAIRMAN AT THE VESTRY MEETING BUT INSTEAD OF EVEN LETTING ME KNOW YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ILLNESS TO HURRY ON MATTERS TO THIS SHAMEFUL AND WICKED EXCESS I DID THE POOR MAN WRONG IN THIS FOR I BELIEVE HE HAD HURRIED THINGS REALLY TO PLEASE ME
8609-283227-0022 HIS FACE HAD LENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY BY THIS TIME AND ITS RUBICUND HUE DECLINED I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD STAND UPON CEREMONY ABOUT IT SIR
8609-283227-0023 BEFORE SUCH A THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED I FEEL SO DISGRACED I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK MISTER TEMPLETON IN THE FACE CARRY THAT TABLE INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN DIRECTLY IT'S MY PROPERTY NOW INTERPOSED THE BROKER I'VE BOUGHT IT OF THE CHURCHWARDEN AND PAID FOR IT
8609-283227-0024 BUT I TELL YOU THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS ILLEGAL AND IF YOU CARRY AWAY THAT TABLE I SHALL SEE WHAT THE LAW WILL DO FOR ME I ASSURE YOU I WILL PROSECUTE YOU MYSELF YOU TAKE UP THAT MONEY OR I WILL IT WILL GO TO PAY COUNSEL I GIVE YOU MY WORD IF YOU DO NOT TAKE IT TO QUENCH STRIFE
8609-283227-0025 I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND BUT THE BROKER WAS BEFORE ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE POCKETED THE MONEY JUMPED INTO HIS CART WITH HIS MAN AND DROVE OFF LEAVING THE CHURCHWARDEN AND THE PARSON STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DISSENTING MINISTER WITH HIS MAHOGANY TABLE ON THE PATH BETWEEN THEM NOW MISTER BROWNRIGG I SAID
8609-283227-0026 LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
8609-283227-0027 AND SO MISTER BROWNRIGG AND I BLUNDERED INTO THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH OUR BURDEN NOT A GREAT ONE
8609-283227-0028 MISTER TEMPLETON SAT IN A WINDSOR CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM EVIDENTLY THE TABLE HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM BEFORE HIM LEAVING HIS POSITION UNCOVERED THE FLOOR WAS STREWED WITH THE BOOKS WHICH HAD LAIN UPON IT HE SAT READING AN OLD FOLIO AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
8609-283227-0029 BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
8609-283227-0030 GLANCING FIRST AT THE TABLE THEN AT ME AND THEN AT MISTER BROWNRIGG AS IF BEGGING SOMEBODY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY BUT I DID NOT LEAVE HIM A MOMENT IN THIS PERPLEXITY MISTER TEMPLETON I SAID QUITTING THE TABLE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND
8609-283227-0031 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYED LIKE THIS I HAVE MISTER TEMPLETON INTERRUPTED ME I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE WITH ME HE SAID ON NO OTHER GROUND I KNOW IT I KNOW IT I SAID INTERRUPTING HIM IN MY TURN
8609-283227-0032 I BEG YOUR PARDON AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AMENDS FOR IT OFFENCES MUST COME YOU KNOW MISTER TEMPLETON BUT I TRUST I HAVE NOT INCURRED THE WOE THAT FOLLOWS UPON THEM BY MEANS OF WHOM THEY COME FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND INDEED WAS TOO ILL
8609-283227-0033 MISTER BROWNRIGG I SPOKE IN HEAT WHEN I CAME UP TO YOU AND I AM SURE I DID YOU WRONG I AM CERTAIN YOU HAD NO IMPROPER MOTIVE IN NOT MAKING ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR PROCEEDINGS YOU MEANT NO HARM TO ME BUT YOU DID VERY WRONG TOWARDS MISTER TEMPLETON I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT WHEN I AM WELL AGAIN
8609-283227-0034 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0035 AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
8609-283227-0036 THE GIST OF THE LETTER LAY IN THESE WORDS I CONFESS IT PERPLEXES ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECONCILE YOUR CHRISTIAN AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO ONE WHOM MOST OF YOUR BRETHREN WOULD CONSIDER AS MUCH BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AS INFERIOR TO THEM IN SOCIAL POSITION
8609-283227-0037 WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
8609-283227-0038 MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
8609-283227-0039 TO MISSUS TEMPLETON FOR NOT INVITING HER WITH YOU
8609-283227-0040 HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
8609-283227-0041 I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
8609-283227-0042 OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
8609-283227-0043 TO THE SUPPORT OF ITS ORDINANCES AND NOT TO BE COMPELLED AFTER SUCH A FASHION THERE I HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0044 I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
8609-283227-0045 OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
8609-283227-0046 IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0047 MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
8609-283227-0048 BUT IS THERE NOT THIS DIFFERENCE THAT OUR LORD WAS AS YOU SAY A CHILD OF THE JEWISH CHURCH WHICH WAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED BY GOD NOW IF I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELONG TO THE SO CALLED ENGLISH CHURCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY CHURCH RATE OR TRIBUTE
8609-283227-0049 SHALL I TELL YOU THE ARGUMENT THE ENGLISH CHURCH MIGHT THEN USE THE CHURCH MIGHT SAY THEN YOU ARE A STRANGER AND NO CHILD THEREFORE LIKE THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WE MAY TAKE TRIBUTE OF YOU SO YOU SEE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THAT DISSENTERS ALONE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY CHURCH RATES
8609-283227-0050 WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS PUSHING OF THE ARGUMENT TO ILLEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS THEN I RESUMED BUT THE REAL ARGUMENT IS THAT NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS SHOULD WE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS OR ANY FAULTS SO LONG AS IT IS THE REPOSITORY OF THE TRUTH SHOULD YOU SEPARATE FROM THE CHURCH
8609-283227-0051 I WILL YIELD THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN SHOW ME THE SAME GROUND FOR BELIEVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE NATIONAL CHURCH APPOINTED SUCH BY GOD THAT I CAN SHOW YOU AND YOU KNOW ALREADY FOR RECEIVING THE JEWISH CHURCH AS THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD
8609-283227-0052 THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LONG ARGUMENT UPON WHICH THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT UPON THE MATTER MYSELF I CANNOT SAY I AM PREPARED TO ENTER AT THIS MOMENT MEANTIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY A CHILD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
8609-283227-0053 HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
8609-283227-0054 AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
8609-283227-0055 A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
8609-283227-0056 AND THE SPIRIT THAT PROCEEDETH FROM THEM IS TEACHING YOU AS I BELIEVE I TOO AM BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME WHY THEN SHOULD I BE ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ANYTHING WILL YOU NOT IN HIS GOOD TIME COME TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE YOU SEE
8609-283227-0057 I AM RELIEVED TO SPEAK MY MIND KNOWING HE WOULD HAVE US SPEAK OUR MINDS TO EACH OTHER BUT I DO NOT WANT TO PROSELYTIZE IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU WILL PROBABLY DO SO ON DIFFERENT GROUNDS FROM ANY I GIVE YOU
8609-283227-0058 AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A UNIVERSITY LIKE YOU BUT I'M NO FOOL EITHER I HOPE DON'T BE OFFENDED AT MY QUESTION WOULDN'T YOU BE GLAD TO SEE ME OUT OF YOUR PARISH NOW I BEGAN TO SPEAK BUT HE WENT ON
8609-283227-0059 DON'T YOU REGARD ME AS AN INTERLOPER NOW ONE WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE CHURCH GOD FORBID I ANSWERED IF A WORD OF MINE WOULD MAKE YOU LEAVE MY PARISH TO MORROW I DARE NOT SAY IT
8609-283227-0060 I DO NOT WANT TO INCUR THE REBUKE OF OUR LORD FOR SURELY THE WORDS FORBID HIM NOT INVOLVED SOME REBUKE WOULD IT NOT BE A FEARFUL THING THAT ONE SOUL BECAUSE OF A DEED OF MINE SHOULD RECEIVE A LESS PORTION OF ELEVATION OR COMFORT IN HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS HOME
8609-283227-0061 ARE THERE NOT COUNTLESS MODES OF SAYING THE TRUTH YOU HAVE SOME OF THEM I HOPE I HAVE SOME
8609-283227-0062 WHO WILL NOT HEAR ME PREACH TO THEM IN THE NAME AND LOVE OF GOD MISTER TEMPLETON SPEAK THAT YOU DO KNOW AND TESTIFY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN YOU AND I WILL HELP EACH OTHER IN PROPORTION AS WE SERVE THE MASTER
8609-283227-0063 I ONLY SAY THAT IN SEPARATING FROM US YOU ARE IN EFFECT AND BY YOUR CONDUCT SAYING TO US DO NOT PREACH FOR YOU FOLLOW NOT WITH US I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE SAME TOWARDS YOU YOUR FATHERS DID THE CHURCH NO END OF GOOD BY LEAVING IT
8609-283227-0064 BUT IT IS TIME TO UNITE NOW ONCE MORE FOLLOWED A SILENCE IF PEOPLE COULD ONLY MEET AND LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE FACE SAID MISTER TEMPLETON AT LENGTH THEY MIGHT FIND THERE WAS NOT SUCH A GULF BETWEEN THEM AS THEY HAD FANCIED AND SO WE PARTED
8609-283227-0065 NOW I DO NOT WRITE ALL THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHURCH RATE QUESTION I WRITE IT TO COMMEMORATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH MISTER TEMPLETON MET ME FOR IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE THAT TWO MEN WHO LOVE THEIR MASTER SHOULD RECOGNIZE EACH THAT THE OTHER DOES SO AND THEREUPON IF NOT BEFORE
8609-283227-0066 AND MANY A TIME ERE HIS DEATH WE CONSULTED TOGETHER ABOUT THINGS THAT BEFELL ONCE HE CAME TO ME ABOUT A LEGAL DIFFICULTY IN CONNEXION WITH THE DEED OF TRUST OF HIS CHAPEL AND ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT HELP HIM MYSELF I DIRECTED HIM TO SUCH HELP AS WAS THOROUGH
8609-283227-0067 AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
8609-283227-0068 THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
8609-283227-0069 I AM SURE THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE MODERATED EVEN CHANGED TOWARDS HER AND THOUGH THIS MAY SEEM OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ONE WHO LOVES THE CHURCH MORE THAN THE BROTHERHOOD IT DOES NOT SEEM OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO ME WHO LOVE THE CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF WHICH IT IS THE TYPE AND THE RESTORER
8609-283227-0070 IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
4051-11217-0000 WHY IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THEY WERE THE SONS OF THAT VERY PHRIXUS WHO IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN CARRIED TO COLCHIS ON THE BACK OF THE GOLDEN FLEECED RAM SINCE THAT TIME PHRIXUS HAD MARRIED THE KING'S DAUGHTER
4051-11217-0001 AND HAD SPENT THEIR PLAY DAYS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GROVE IN THE CENTER OF WHICH THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS HANGING UPON A TREE THEY WERE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO GREECE IN HOPES OF GETTING BACK A KINGDOM THAT HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY TAKEN FROM THEIR FATHER
4051-11217-0002 WHEN THE PRINCES UNDERSTOOD WHITHER THE ARGONAUTS WERE GOING THEY OFFERED TO TURN BACK AND GUIDE THEM TO COLCHIS
4051-11217-0003 EVERY PERSON WHO MIGHT VENTURE WITHIN HIS REACH THERE ARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG PRINCES
4051-11217-0004 I DO NOT WONDER THAT YOU THINK THE DRAGON VERY TERRIBLE YOU HAVE GROWN UP FROM INFANCY IN THE FEAR OF THIS MONSTER
4051-11217-0005 AT ALL EVENTS TURN BACK WHO MAY I WILL NEVER SEE GREECE AGAIN UNLESS I CARRY WITH ME THE GOLDEN FLEECE WE WILL NONE OF US TURN BACK CRIED HIS NINE AND FORTY BRAVE COMRADES
4051-11217-0006 MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO HIM AND ORPHEUS WHOSE CUSTOM IT WAS TO SET EVERYTHING TO MUSIC BEGAN TO HARP AND SING MOST GLORIOUSLY
4051-11217-0007 AND NOTHING SO TRULY HONORABLE AS TO BE EATEN UP AT ONE MOUTHFUL IN CASE OF THE WORST AFTER THIS BEING NOW UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TWO PRINCES WHO WERE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WAY
4051-11217-0008 HEARD OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE INSTANTLY SUMMONED JASON TO COURT
4051-11217-0009 WHO DETHRONED HIS FATHER YOU ARE WELCOME BRAVE JASON
4051-11217-0010 PRAY ARE YOU ON A PLEASURE VOYAGE
4051-11217-0011 OR WHAT OTHER CAUSE HAS PROCURED ME THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING YOU AT MY COURT GREAT SIR REPLIED JASON
4051-11217-0012 FOR CHIRON HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BEHAVE WITH PROPRIETY WHETHER TO KINGS OR BEGGARS
4051-11217-0013 PROVIDED I BRING HIM THE GOLDEN FLEECE THIS AS YOUR MAJESTY IS AWARE IS NOW HANGING ON A TREE HERE AT COLCHIS AND I HUMBLY SOLICIT YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THE KING'S FACE TWISTED ITSELF INTO AN ANGRY FROWN
4051-11217-0014 FOR ABOVE ALL THINGS ELSE IN THE WORLD HE PRIZED THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND WAS EVEN SUSPECTED OF HAVING DONE A VERY WICKED ACT IN ORDER TO GET IT INTO HIS OWN POSSESSION
4051-11217-0015 HAD COME TO COLCHIS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TAKING AWAY HIS CHIEF TREASURE
4051-11217-0016 WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH YOU MUST FULFILL BEFORE GETTING POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE I HAVE HEARD REJOINED THE YOUTH THAT A DRAGON LIES BENEATH THE TREE ON WHICH THE PRIZE HANGS AND THAT WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM RUNS THE RISK OF BEING DEVOURED AT A MOUTHFUL
4051-11217-0017 TRUE SAID THE KING WITH A SMILE THAT DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY GOOD NATURED VERY TRUE YOUNG MAN BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS HARD OR PERHAPS A LITTLE HARDER TO BE DONE BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING DEVOURED BY THE DRAGON FOR EXAMPLE
4051-11217-0018 WHICH VULCAN THE WONDERFUL BLACKSMITH MADE FOR ME THERE IS A FURNACE IN EACH OF THEIR STOMACHS AND THEY BREATHE SUCH HOT FIRE OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS AND NOSTRILS THAT NOBODY HAS HITHERTO GONE NIGH THEM WITHOUT BEING INSTANTLY BURNED TO A SMALL BLACK CINDER
4051-11217-0019 I MUST ENCOUNTER THE PERIL ANSWERED JASON COMPOSEDLY SINCE IT STANDS IN THE WAY OF MY PURPOSE
4051-11217-0020 FROM WHICH CADMUS RAISED A CROP OF ARMED MEN THEY ARE AN UNRULY SET OF REPROBATES THOSE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND UNLESS YOU TREAT THEM SUITABLY THEY WILL FALL UPON YOU SWORD IN HAND

4051-11217-0023 THIS YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM I AM THE KING'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID TO HIM AND MY NAME IS MEDEA I KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF WHICH OTHER YOUNG PRINCESSES ARE IGNORANT AND CAN DO MANY THINGS WHICH THEY WOULD BE AFRAID SO MUCH AS TO DREAM OF IF YOU WILL TRUST TO ME

4051-11217-0025 HE BEHELD A WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE IN HER FACE SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHOSE EYES ARE FULL OF MYSTERY SO THAT WHILE LOOKING INTO THEM
4051-11217-0026 YET CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN WHETHER YOU SEE INTO THE FARTHEST DEPTHS OR WHETHER THERE BE NOT SOMETHING ELSE HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM IF JASON HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF FEARING ANYTHING
4051-11217-0027 FOR BEAUTIFUL AS SHE NOW LOOKED

4051-11217-0032 AND WARNED THEM TO BE IN READINESS IN CASE THERE MIGHT BE NEED OF THEIR HELP AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE MET THE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ON THE MARBLE STEPS OF THE KING'S PALACE
4051-11217-0033 JUST AS THEY HAD BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE MONSTER'S JAWS BY CADMUS LONG AGO MEDEA THEN LED JASON DOWN THE PALACE STEPS AND THROUGH THE SILENT STREETS OF THE CITY AND INTO THE ROYAL PASTURE GROUND WHERE THE TWO BRAZEN FOOTED BULLS WERE KEPT IT WAS A STARRY NIGHT
4051-11217-0034 WITH A BRIGHT GLEAM ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE SKY
4051-11217-0035 IN THAT FARTHEST CORNER OF THE FIELD IT WILL BE EXCELLENT SPORT I ASSURE YOU WHEN THEY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF YOUR FIGURE MY FATHER AND ALL HIS COURT DELIGHT IN NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE A STRANGER TRYING TO YOKE THEM IN ORDER TO COME AT THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11217-0036 IT MAKES A HOLIDAY IN COLCHIS WHENEVER SUCH A THING HAPPENS FOR MY PART I ENJOY IT IMMENSELY YOU CANNOT IMAGINE IN WHAT A MERE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THEIR HOT BREATH SHRIVELS A YOUNG MAN INTO A BLACK CINDER ARE YOU SURE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ASKED JASON
4051-11217-0037 THE INSTANT HE MADE A STEP FARTHER
4051-11217-0038 THESE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WERE CAUSED BY THE BREATH OF THE BRAZEN BULLS WHICH WAS QUIETLY STEALING OUT OF THEIR FOUR NOSTRILS AS THEY LAY CHEWING THEIR CUDS AT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE STEPS WHICH JASON MADE
4051-11217-0039 THE FOUR FIERY STREAMS APPEARED TO GUSH OUT SOMEWHAT MORE PLENTIFULLY FOR THE TWO BRAZEN BULLS HAD HEARD HIS FOOT TRAMP AND WERE LIFTING UP THEIR HOT NOSES TO SNUFF THE AIR HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER
4051-11217-0040 ONE OTHER STRIDE DID BOLD JASON MAKE AND SUDDENLY AS A STREAK OF LIGHTNING ON CAME THESE FIERY ANIMALS
4051-11217-0041 AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FASHION WITH ANGRY BULLS THEIR BREATH SCORCHED THE HERBAGE BEFORE THEM SO INTENSELY HOT IT WAS INDEED THAT IT CAUGHT A DRY TREE UNDER WHICH JASON WAS NOW STANDING AND SET IT ALL IN A LIGHT BLAZE BUT AS FOR JASON HIMSELF
4051-11218-0000 GREATLY ENCOURAGED AT FINDING HIMSELF NOT YET TURNED INTO A CINDER
4051-11218-0001 JUST AS THE BRAZEN BRUTES FANCIED THEMSELVES SURE OF TOSSING HIM INTO THE AIR HE CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BY THE HORN AND THE OTHER BY HIS SCREWED UP TAIL AND HELD THEM IN A GRIPE LIKE THAT OF AN IRON VICE ONE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE OTHER WITH HIS LEFT
4051-11218-0002 TO BE SURE BUT THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE BRAZEN BULLS WERE ENCHANTED CREATURES AND THAT JASON HAD BROKEN THE SPELL OF THEIR FIERY FIERCENESS BY HIS BOLD WAY OF HANDLING THEM AND EVER SINCE THAT TIME
4051-11218-0003 WHEN DANGER ASSAILS THEM TO DO WHAT THEY CALL TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND TO GRIPE HIM BY THE TAIL IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THAT IS TO THROW ASIDE FEAR AND OVERCOME THE PERIL BY DESPISING IT
4051-11218-0004 IT WAS NOW EASY TO YOKE THE BULLS AND TO HARNESS THEM TO THE PLOW
4051-11218-0005 WHO PERHAPS USED TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE HARNESSED TO THE PLOW AT ANY RATE OUR HERO SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY WELL IN BREAKING UP THE GREENSWARD AND BY THE TIME THAT THE MOON WAS A QUARTER OF HER JOURNEY UP THE SKY THE PLOWED FIELD LAY BEFORE HIM
4051-11218-0006 A LARGE TRACT OF BLACK EARTH READY TO BE SOWN WITH THE DRAGON'S TEETH SO JASON SCATTERED THEM BROADCAST AND HARROWED THEM INTO THE SOIL WITH A BRUSH HARROW AND TOOK HIS STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE FIELD ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT
4051-11218-0007 MUST WE WAIT LONG FOR HARVEST TIME HE INQUIRED OF MEDEA WHO WAS NOW STANDING BY HIS SIDE WHETHER SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE SURE TO COME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS A CROP OF ARMED MEN NEVER FAILS TO SPRING UP WHEN THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN
4051-11218-0008 AND WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE THE YELLOW GRAIN WOULD BE RIPENED FOR THE SICKLE BUT BY AND BY ALL OVER THE FIELD
4051-11218-0009 LIKE SPARKLING DROPS OF DEW THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS SPROUTED HIGHER AND PROVED TO BE THE STEEL HEADS OF SPEARS THEN THERE WAS A DAZZLING GLEAM FROM A VAST NUMBER OF POLISHED BRASS HELMETS BENEATH WHICH AS THEY GREW FARTHER OUT OF THE SOIL
4051-11218-0010 TORE THEMSELVES UP BY THE ROOTS WHEREVER A DRAGON'S TOOTH HAD FALLEN THERE STOOD A MAN ARMED FOR BATTLE THEY MADE A CLANGOR WITH THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND EYED ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY
4051-11218-0011 FULL OF RAGE AND STORMY PASSIONS AND READY TO TAKE THE LIFE OF EVERY HUMAN BROTHER IN RECOMPENSE OF THE BOON OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE
4051-11218-0012 AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE REJOICED ANY GREAT CAPTAIN WHO WAS BENT ON CONQUERING THE WORLD LIKE ALEXANDER OR NAPOLEON TO RAISE A CROP OF ARMED SOLDIERS AS EASILY AS JASON DID
4051-11218-0013 CLASHING THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND BOILING OVER WITH THE RED HOT THIRST FOR BATTLE THEN THEY BEGAN TO SHOUT SHOW US THE ENEMY LEAD US TO THE CHARGE DEATH OR VICTORY COME ON BRAVE COMRADES CONQUER OR DIE
4051-11218-0014 AND A HUNDRED OTHER OUTCRIES SUCH AS MEN ALWAYS BELLOW FORTH ON A BATTLE FIELD AND WHICH THESE DRAGON PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE AT THEIR TONGUES ENDS AT LAST THE FRONT RANK CAUGHT SIGHT OF JASON WHO BEHOLDING THE FLASH OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4051-11218-0015 HAD THOUGHT IT BEST TO DRAW HIS SWORD IN A MOMENT ALL THE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH APPEARED TO TAKE JASON FOR AN ENEMY AND CRYING WITH ONE VOICE GUARD THE GOLDEN FLEECE THEY RAN AT HIM WITH UPLIFTED SWORDS AND PROTRUDED SPEARS
4051-11218-0016 THE ARMED MEN WERE NOW SO NIGH THAT JASON COULD DISCERN THE FIRE FLASHING OUT OF THEIR ENRAGED EYES WHEN HE LET FLY THE STONE AND SAW IT STRIKE THE HELMET OF A TALL WARRIOR WHO WAS RUSHING UPON HIM WITH HIS BLADE ALOFT
4051-11218-0017 AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING ANY FARTHER TOWARDS JASON THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES THE CONFUSION SPREAD THROUGH THE HOST
4051-11218-0018 HEWING AND STABBING AT ONE ANOTHER LOPPING OFF ARMS HEADS AND LEGS AND DOING SUCH MEMORABLE DEEDS THAT JASON WAS FILLED WITH IMMENSE ADMIRATION ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING TO BEHOLD THESE MIGHTY MEN PUNISHING EACH OTHER
4051-11218-0019 FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
4051-11218-0020 THE LAST SURVIVOR THE BRAVEST AND STRONGEST OF THE WHOLE HAD JUST FORCE ENOUGH TO WAVE HIS CRIMSON SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND GIVE A SHOUT OF EXULTATION CRYING VICTORY VICTORY IMMORTAL FAME
4051-11218-0021 WHEN HE HIMSELF FELL DOWN AND LAY QUIETLY AMONG HIS SLAIN BRETHREN AND THERE WAS THE END OF THE ARMY THAT HAD SPROUTED FROM THE DRAGON'S TEETH THAT FIERCE AND FEVERISH FIGHT WAS THE ONLY ENJOYMENT WHICH THEY HAD TASTED ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH
4051-11218-0022 LET THEM SLEEP IN THE BED OF HONOR SAID THE PRINCESS MEDEA WITH A SLY SMILE AT JASON THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS HAVE SIMPLETONS ENOUGH JUST LIKE THEM FIGHTING AND DYING FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT AND FANCYING THAT POSTERITY
4051-11218-0023 WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PUT LAUREL WREATHS ON THEIR RUSTY AND BATTERED HELMETS COULD YOU HELP SMILING PRINCE JASON TO SEE THE SELF CONCEIT OF THAT LAST FELLOW
4051-11218-0024 YOU WILL THINK DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MEDEA TRUE THE GOLDEN FLEECE MAY NOT BE SO VALUABLE AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT IT BUT THEN THERE IS NOTHING BETTER IN THE WORLD AND ONE MUST NEEDS HAVE AN OBJECT YOU KNOW COME YOUR NIGHT'S WORK HAS BEEN WELL PERFORMED
4051-11218-0025 THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR ALLOTTED TASK IS FULFILLED
4051-11218-0026 ENTERING THE PRESENCE CHAMBER HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND MADE A LOW OBEISANCE YOUR EYES LOOK HEAVY PRINCE JASON OBSERVED THE KING YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
4051-11218-0027 AND HAVE CONCLUDED NOT TO GET YOURSELF SCORCHED TO A CINDER IN ATTEMPTING TO TAME MY BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS
4051-11218-0028 THE FIELD HAS BEEN PLOWED THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN BROADCAST AND HARROWED INTO THE SOIL
4051-11218-0029 AND DEPART WITH MY NINE AND FORTY COMRADES
4051-11218-0030 AND LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND EXCESSIVELY DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS KINGLY PROMISE HE OUGHT NOW TO PERMIT JASON TO WIN THE FLEECE IF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO SO BUT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD MET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK IN THE MATTER OF THE BRAZEN BULLS
4051-11218-0031 AND THE DRAGON'S TEETH THE KING FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN SLAYING THE DRAGON AND THEREFORE THOUGH HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SEEN JASON SNAPPED UP AT A MOUTHFUL HE WAS RESOLVED AND IT WAS A VERY WRONG THING OF THIS WICKED POTENTATE
4051-11218-0032 NOT TO RUN ANY FURTHER RISK OF LOSING HIS BELOVED FLEECE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS BUSINESS YOUNG MAN SAID HE IF MY UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD NOT HELPED YOU WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS HAD YOU ACTED FAIRLY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS INSTANT
4051-11218-0033 TO SPEAK MY MIND PLAINLY YOU SHALL NEVER SET EYES ON SO MUCH AS ONE OF ITS GLISTENING LOCKS JASON LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE IN GREAT SORROW AND ANGER HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BETTER
4051-11218-0034 MARCH AT ONCE TO THE GROVE OF MARS SLAY THE DRAGON TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE GET ON BOARD THE ARGO AND SPREAD ALL SAIL FOR IOLCHOS THE SUCCESS OF THIS SCHEME DEPENDED IT IS TRUE ON THE DOUBTFUL POINT
4051-11218-0035 AT SO MANY MOUTHFULS BY THE DRAGON BUT AS JASON WAS HASTENING DOWN THE PALACE STEPS
4051-11218-0036 AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD DONE HIM SO MUCH SERVICE ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS BY NO MEANS VERY CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO HIM AN EQUALLY GREAT MISCHIEF BEFORE SUNSET THESE ENCHANTRESSES YOU MUST KNOW ARE NEVER TO BE DEPENDED UPON
4051-11218-0037 WILL HE GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER RISK OR TROUBLE ON THE CONTRARY ANSWERED JASON HE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR TAMING THE BRAZEN BULLS AND SOWING THE DRAGON'S TEETH
4051-11218-0038 AND HE FORBIDS ME TO MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AND POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHETHER I SLAY THE DRAGON OR NO YES JASON SAID THE PRINCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE UNLESS YOU SET SAIL FROM COLCHIS
4051-11218-0039 STEALING THROUGH THE STREETS OF COLCHIS ON THEIR WAY TO THE SACRED GROVE
4051-11218-0040 LOWING NODDING THEIR HEADS AND THRUSTING FORTH THEIR SNOUTS WHICH AS OTHER CATTLE DO
4051-11218-0041 THEIR FIERCE NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY TAMED AND WITH THEIR FIERCENESS THE TWO FURNACES IN THEIR STOMACHS HAD LIKEWISE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
4051-11218-0042 THAN EVER BEFORE INDEED IT HAD HERETOFORE BEEN A GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO THESE POOR ANIMALS THAT WHENEVER THEY WISHED TO EAT A MOUTHFUL OF GRASS THE FIRE OUT OF THEIR NOSTRILS HAD SHRIVELED IT UP BEFORE THEY COULD MANAGE TO CROP IT
4051-11218-0043 HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT NOW INSTEAD OF EMITTING JETS OF FLAME AND STREAMS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR THEY BREATHED THE VERY SWEETEST OF COW BREATH AFTER KINDLY PATTING THE BULLS
4051-11218-0044 JASON FOLLOWED MEDEA'S GUIDANCE INTO THE GROVE OF MARS WHERE THE GREAT OAK TREES THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR CENTURIES THREW SO THICK A SHADE THAT THE MOONBEAMS STRUGGLED VAINLY TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH IT
4051-11218-0045 MEDEA SQUEEZED JASON'S HAND LOOK YONDER SHE WHISPERED DO YOU SEE IT GLEAMING AMONG THE VENERABLE OAKS THERE WAS A RADIANCE NOT LIKE THE MOONBEAMS BUT RATHER RESEMBLING THE GOLDEN GLORY OF THE SETTING SUN
4051-11218-0046 WHAT IS IT ASKED JASON HAVE YOU COME SO FAR TO SEEK IT
4051-11218-0047 WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
4051-11218-0048 PRIZE WHICH SO MANY HEROES HAD LONGED TO BEHOLD BUT HAD PERISHED IN THE QUEST OF IT EITHER BY THE PERILS OF THEIR VOYAGE OR BY THE FIERY BREATH OF THE BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS HOW GLORIOUSLY IT SHINES CRIED JASON IN A RAPTURE IT
4051-11218-0049 THE TERRIBLE DRAGON HAD QUITE SLIPPED OUT OF JASON'S MEMORY SOON HOWEVER SOMETHING CAME TO PASS THAT REMINDED HIM WHAT PERILS WERE STILL TO BE ENCOUNTERED AN ANTELOPE THAT PROBABLY MISTOOK THE YELLOW RADIANCE FOR SUNRISE CAME
4051-11218-0050 FOR HE WAS TWISTED ROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE ON WHICH THE FLEECE HUNG AND SEIZING THE POOR ANTELOPE SWALLOWED HIM WITH ONE SNAP OF HIS JAWS AFTER THIS FEAT THE DRAGON SEEMED SENSIBLE THAT SOME OTHER LIVING CREATURE WAS WITHIN REACH
4051-11218-0051 ON WHICH HE FELT INCLINED TO FINISH HIS MEAL IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS HE KEPT POKING HIS UGLY SNOUT AMONG THE TREES STRETCHING OUT HIS NECK A TERRIBLE LONG WAY NOW HERE
4051-11218-0052 UPON MY WORD AS THE HEAD CAME WAVING AND UNDULATING THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHING ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH OF PRINCE JASON IT WAS A VERY HIDEOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SIGHT
4051-11218-0053 THE GAPE OF HIS ENORMOUS JAWS WAS NEARLY AS WIDE AS THE GATEWAY OF THE KING'S PALACE WELL JASON WHISPERED MEDEA FOR SHE WAS ILL NATURED AS ALL ENCHANTRESSES ARE AND WANTED TO MAKE THE BOLD YOUTH TREMBLE
4051-11218-0054 WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW OF YOUR PROSPECT OF WINNING THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON ANSWERED ONLY BY DRAWING HIS SWORD AND MAKING A STEP FORWARD STAY FOOLISH YOUTH SAID MEDEA GRASPING HIS ARM
4051-11218-0055 FAR MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN YOUR SWORD THE DRAGON HAD PROBABLY HEARD THE VOICES FOR SWIFT AS LIGHTNING HIS BLACK HEAD AND FORKED TONGUE CAME HISSING AMONG THE TREES AGAIN DARTING FULL FORTY FEET AT A STRETCH AS IT APPROACHED
4051-11218-0056 MEDEA TOSSED THE CONTENTS OF THE GOLD BOX RIGHT DOWN THE MONSTER'S WIDE OPEN THROAT IMMEDIATELY WITH AN OUTRAGEOUS HISS AND A TREMENDOUS WRIGGLE FLINGING HIS TAIL UP TO THE TIP TOP OF THE TALLEST TREE
4051-11218-0057 AND SHATTERING ALL ITS BRANCHES AS IT CRASHED HEAVILY DOWN AGAIN THE DRAGON FELL AT FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND AND LAY QUITE MOTIONLESS IT IS ONLY A SLEEPING POTION SAID THE ENCHANTRESS TO PRINCE JASON
4051-11218-0058 SO I DID NOT WISH TO KILL HIM OUTRIGHT QUICK SNATCH THE PRIZE AND LET US BEGONE YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON CAUGHT THE FLEECE FROM THE TREE
4051-11218-0059 WITH HER PEACOCK BESIDE HER SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY AND BECKONING HIM TO MAKE HASTE DISAPPEARED AMONG THE DUSKINESS OF THE TREES
4051-11218-0060 WHO WERE DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN THE MOONLIGHT A FEW HUNDRED FEET ALOFT JASON BADE THEM TELL THE REST OF THE ARGONAUTS TO EMBARK AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE BUT LYNCEUS WITH HIS SHARP EYES HAD ALREADY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIM BRINGING THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11218-0061 ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STONE WALLS A HILL AND THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE GROVE OF MARS INTERVENED BETWEEN BY HIS ADVICE THE HEROES HAD SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE BENCHES OF THE GALLEY
4051-11218-0062 HELD PERPENDICULARLY READY TO LET FALL INTO THE WATER AS JASON DREW NEAR HE HEARD THE TALKING IMAGE CALLING TO HIM WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY EAGERNESS IN ITS GRAVE SWEET VOICE MAKE HASTE PRINCE JASON FOR YOUR LIFE MAKE HASTE
6880-216547-0000 THE FOLLOWING LETTER SERVED AS A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS MEMOIR
6880-216547-0001 PARIS JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FORTY GENTLEMEN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DEBATE OF THE NINTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE IN REGARD TO THE TRIENNIAL PENSION ESTABLISHED BY MADAME SUARD
6880-216547-0002 YOU EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING WISH THE ACADEMY REQUESTS THE TITULARY TO PRESENT IT ANNUALLY DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN JULY WITH A SUCCINCT AND LOGICAL STATEMENT OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES WHICH HE HAS PURSUED DURING THE YEAR
6880-216547-0003 WHICH HAS JUST EXPIRED I NOW PROPOSE GENTLEMEN TO DISCHARGE THIS DUTY
6880-216547-0004 WHEN I SOLICITED YOUR VOTES I BOLDLY AVOWED MY INTENTION TO BEND MY EFFORTS TO THE DISCOVERY OF SOME MEANS OF AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL
6880-216547-0005 MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER CLASSES THIS IDEA FOREIGN AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED TO THE OBJECT OF MY CANDIDACY YOU RECEIVED FAVORABLY
6880-216547-0006 YOU CHANGED THIS FORMAL OFFER INTO AN INVIOLABLE AND SACRED OBLIGATION THENCEFORTH I UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW WORTHY AND HONORABLE A SOCIETY I HAD TO DEAL MY REGARD FOR ITS ENLIGHTENMENT MY RECOGNITION OF ITS BENEFITS
6880-216547-0007 MY ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS GLORY WERE UNBOUNDED CONVINCED AT ONCE THAT IN ORDER TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE BEATEN PATHS OF OPINIONS AND SYSTEMS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROCEED IN MY STUDY OF MAN AND SOCIETY
6880-216547-0008 BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND IN A RIGOROUS MANNER I DEVOTED ONE YEAR TO PHILOLOGY AND GRAMMAR LINGUISTICS OR THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SPEECH BEING OF ALL THE SCIENCES THAT
6880-216547-0009 SEEMED TO BEAR THE CLOSEST RELATION TO THE RESEARCHES WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE
6880-216547-0010 IF IT DID NOT REVEAL THE ASTONISHING SUCCESS AT LEAST BORE WITNESS TO THE THOROUGHNESS OF MY LABORS SINCE THAT TIME METAPHYSICS AND MORAL SCIENCE HAVE BEEN MY ONLY STUDIES
6880-216547-0011 MY PERCEPTION OF THE FACT THAT THESE SCIENCES THOUGH BADLY DEFINED AS TO THEIR OBJECT AND NOT CONFINED TO THEIR SPHERE ARE LIKE THE NATURAL SCIENCES SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEMONSTRATION AND CERTAINTY
6880-216547-0012 HAS ALREADY REWARDED MY EFFORTS BUT GENTLEMEN OF ALL THE MASTERS WHOM I HAVE FOLLOWED TO NONE DO I OWE SO MUCH AS TO YOU
6880-216547-0013 YOUR CO OPERATION YOUR PROGRAMMES YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH MY SECRET WISHES AND MOST CHERISHED HOPES HAVE AT NO TIME FAILED TO ENLIGHTEN ME AND TO POINT OUT MY ROAD THIS MEMOIR ON PROPERTY
6880-216547-0014 IS THE CHILD OF YOUR THOUGHT
6880-216547-0015 TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION
6880-216547-0016 THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0017 WHEN YOUR COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE COMPETITORS HAD ENUMERATED WITH EXACTNESS THE IMMEDIATE AND PARTICULAR CAUSES OF SUICIDE AS WELL AS THE MEANS OF PREVENTING EACH OF THEM BUT THAT FROM THIS ENUMERATION
6880-216547-0018 CHRONICLED WITH MORE OR LESS SKILL NO POSITIVE INFORMATION HAD BEEN GAINED EITHER AS TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVIL OR AS TO ITS REMEDY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
6880-216547-0019 YOUR PROGRAMME ALWAYS ORIGINAL AND VARIED IN ITS ACADEMICAL EXPRESSION BECAME MORE EXACT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT HAD POINTED OUT AS THE CAUSES OR RATHER AS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE SOCIAL MALADY
6880-216547-0020 THE NEGLECT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION AND MORALITY THE DESIRE FOR WEALTH THE PASSION FOR ENJOYMENT AND POLITICAL DISTURBANCES ALL THESE DATA WERE EMBODIED BY YOU IN A SINGLE PROPOSITION
6880-216547-0021 THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE MORALITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION IN A CHRISTIAN TONGUE YOU ASKED GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0022 WHAT WAS THE TRUE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY A COMPETITOR
6880-216547-0023 DARED TO MAINTAIN AND BELIEVED THAT HE HAD PROVED THAT THE INSTITUTION OF A DAY OF REST AT WEEKLY INTERVALS IS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH A POLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS
6880-216547-0024 THAT WITHOUT EQUALITY THIS INSTITUTION IS AN ANOMALY AND AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT EQUALITY ALONE CAN REVIVE THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS KEEPING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
6880-216547-0025 THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT MEET WITH YOUR APPROBATION SINCE WITHOUT DENYING THE RELATION POINTED OUT BY THE COMPETITOR YOU JUDGED AND RIGHTLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0026 THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED THE IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR WERE NOTHING MORE THAN HYPOTHESES FINALLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0027 THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY YOU PRESENTED FOR COMPETITION IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
6880-216547-0028 THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN
6880-216547-0029 INSTEAD OF CONFINING ONE TO COMMON PLACES WITHOUT BREADTH OR SIGNIFICANCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR QUESTION SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS FOLLOWS
6880-216547-0030 CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0031 CEASE TO HEED IT IN THE RACE IN THE TRIBE IN THE NATION CAN EQUALITY BY THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION BE PRESERVED BETWEEN CITIZENS AS WELL AS BETWEEN COUSINS AND BROTHERS
6880-216547-0032 IN A WORD CAN THE PRINCIPLE OF SUCCESSION BECOME A PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY TO SUM UP ALL THESE IDEAS IN ONE INCLUSIVE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0033 WHAT ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF INEQUALITY WHAT IS PROPERTY SUCH GENTLEMEN IS THE OBJECT OF THE MEMOIR THAT I OFFER YOU TO DAY
6880-216547-0034 IF I HAVE RIGHTLY GRASPED THE OBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHT IF I SUCCEED IN BRINGING TO LIGHT A TRUTH WHICH IS INDISPUTABLE BUT FROM CAUSES WHICH I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO CLAIM TO HAVE EXPLAINED
6880-216547-0035 HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IF BY AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION I ESTABLISH THE DOGMA OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IF I DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW THE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE FORM OF SOCIETY
6880-216547-0036 TO YOU GENTLEMEN WILL REDOUND ALL THE GLORY FOR IT IS TO YOUR AID AND YOUR INSPIRATION THAT I OWE IT MY PURPOSE IN THIS WORK IS THE APPLICATION OF METHOD
6880-216547-0037 TO THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY EVERY OTHER INTENTION IS FOREIGN TO AND EVEN ABUSIVE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN LIGHTLY OF JURISPRUDENCE I HAD THE RIGHT
6880-216547-0038 BUT I SHOULD BE UNJUST DID I NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS PRETENDED SCIENCE AND THE MEN WHO PRACTISE IT DEVOTED TO STUDIES BOTH LABORIOUS AND SEVERE
6880-216547-0039 ENTITLED IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ESTEEM OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ELOQUENCE OUR LEGISTS DESERVE BUT ONE REPROACH THAT OF AN EXCESSIVE DEFERENCE TO ARBITRARY LAWS
6880-216547-0040 AND THEIR UNWARRANTED BLUNDERS HAVE DISGUSTED ME WHOEVER KNOWING THEM PARDONS THEM MAY READ THEM I HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THE LEARNED CHRISTIAN CHURCH
6880-216547-0041 IT WAS MY DUTY THIS BLAME RESULTS FROM THE FACTS WHICH I CALL ATTENTION TO WHY HAS THE CHURCH DECREED CONCERNING THINGS WHICH IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
6880-216547-0042 THE CHURCH HAS ERRED IN DOGMA AND IN MORALS PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TESTIFY AGAINST HER IT MAY BE WRONG FOR ME TO SAY IT BUT SURELY IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR CHRISTIANITY THAT IT IS TRUE
6880-216547-0043 TO RESTORE RELIGION GENTLEMEN IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN THE CHURCH PERHAPS YOU WILL REGRET GENTLEMEN THAT IN GIVING ALL MY ATTENTION TO METHOD AND EVIDENCE
6880-216547-0044 I HAVE TOO MUCH NEGLECTED FORM AND STYLE IN VAIN SHOULD I HAVE TRIED TO DO BETTER LITERARY HOPE AND FAITH I HAVE NONE
6880-216547-0045 THAT IS THE REASON IN MY OPINION WHY AMONG SO MANY MEN OF TALENT FRANCE TO DAY COUNTS NOT ONE GREAT WRITER
6880-216547-0046 IN A SOCIETY LIKE OURS TO SEEK FOR LITERARY GLORY SEEMS TO ME AN ANACHRONISM OF WHAT USE IS IT TO INVOKE AN ANCIENT SIBYL WHEN A MUSE IS ON THE EVE OF BIRTH
6880-216547-0047 PITIABLE ACTORS IN A TRAGEDY NEARING ITS END THAT WHICH IT BEHOOVES US TO DO IS TO PRECIPITATE THE CATASTROPHE THE MOST DESERVING AMONG US IS HE WHO PLAYS BEST THIS PART WELL
6880-216547-0048 I NO LONGER ASPIRE TO THIS SAD SUCCESS WHY SHOULD I NOT CONFESS IT GENTLEMEN I HAVE ASPIRED TO YOUR SUFFRAGES AND SOUGHT THE TITLE OF YOUR PENSIONER HATING ALL WHICH EXISTS AND FULL OF PROJECTS FOR ITS DESTRUCTION
6880-216547-0049 AND THE MOST PRECIOUS FRUIT THAT I COULD WISH TO GATHER FROM THIS MEMOIR WOULD BE THE INSPIRATION OF MY READERS WITH THAT TRANQUILLITY OF SOUL WHICH ARISES FROM THE CLEAR PERCEPTION OF EVIL AND ITS CAUSE
6880-216547-0050 AND WHICH IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN PASSION AND ENTHUSIASM MY HATRED OF PRIVILEGE AND HUMAN AUTHORITY WAS UNBOUNDED PERHAPS AT TIMES I HAVE BEEN GUILTY IN MY INDIGNATION
6880-216547-0051 OF CONFOUNDING PERSONS AND THINGS AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY DESPISE AND COMPLAIN TO CEASE TO HATE I ONLY NEEDED TO KNOW
6880-216547-0052 IT IS FOR YOU NOW GENTLEMEN WHOSE MISSION AND CHARACTER ARE THE PROCLAMATION OF THE TRUTH IT IS FOR YOU TO INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE AND TO TELL THEM FOR WHAT THEY OUGHT TO HOPE
6880-216547-0053 AND WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FEAR THE PEOPLE INCAPABLE AS YET OF SOUND JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM APPLAUD INDISCRIMINATELY THE MOST OPPOSITE IDEAS PROVIDED THAT IN THEM THEY GET A TASTE OF FLATTERY
6880-216547-0054 TO THEM THE LAWS OF THOUGHT ARE LIKE THE CONFINES OF THE POSSIBLE TO DAY THEY CAN NO MORE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A SAVANT AND A SOPHIST THAN FORMERLY THEY COULD TELL A PHYSICIAN FROM A SORCERER
6880-216547-0055 INCONSIDERATELY ACCEPTING GATHERING TOGETHER AND ACCUMULATING EVERYTHING THAT IS NEW REGARDING ALL REPORTS AS TRUE
6880-216547-0056 THEY ASSEMBLE LIKE BEES AT THE SOUND OF A BASIN
6880-216547-0057 MAY YOU GENTLEMEN DESIRE EQUALITY AS I MYSELF DESIRE IT MAY YOU FOR THE ETERNAL HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRY BECOME ITS PROPAGATORS AND ITS HERALDS
6880-216547-0058 MAY I BE THE LAST OF YOUR PENSIONERS OF ALL THE WISHES THAT I CAN FRAME THAT GENTLEMEN IS THE MOST WORTHY OF YOU AND THE MOST HONORABLE FOR ME
6880-216547-0059 TWO MONTHS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER THE ACADEMY IN ITS DEBATE OF AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH REPLIED TO THE ADDRESS OF ITS PENSIONER BY A NOTE THE TEXT OF WHICH I GIVE BELOW
6880-216547-0060 PUBLISHED LAST JUNE BY THE TITULARY OF THE SUARD PENSION ENTITLED WHAT IS PROPERTY AND DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR TO THE ACADEMY HE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE SOCIETY OWES IT TO JUSTICE
6880-216547-0061 TO EXAMPLE AND TO ITS OWN DIGNITY TO PUBLICLY DISAVOW ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ANTI SOCIAL DOCTRINES CONTAINED IN THIS PUBLICATION IN CONSEQUENCE HE DEMANDS
6880-216547-0062 IN THE MOST FORMAL MANNER THE WORK OF THE SUARD PENSIONER AS HAVING BEEN PUBLISHED WITHOUT ITS ASSENT AND AS ATTRIBUTING TO IT OPINIONS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF EACH OF ITS MEMBERS
6880-216547-0063 IN CASE HE SHOULD PUBLISH A SECOND EDITION OF HIS BOOK TO OMIT THE DEDICATION
6880-216547-0064 THAT THIS JUDGMENT OF THE ACADEMY BE PLACED UPON THE RECORDS THESE THREE PROPOSITIONS PUT TO VOTE ARE ADOPTED
6880-216547-0065 AFTER THIS LUDICROUS DECREE WHICH ITS AUTHORS THOUGHT TO RENDER POWERFUL BY GIVING IT THE FORM OF A CONTRADICTION
6880-216547-0066 I CAN ONLY BEG THE READER NOT TO MEASURE THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY COMPATRIOTS BY THAT OF OUR ACADEMY WHILE MY PATRONS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES WERE FULMINATING ANATHEMAS AGAINST MY BROCHURE
6880-216547-0067 WHO DID NOT KNOW ME WHO MIGHT EVEN HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF AS PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY THE TOO SHARP JUDGMENT WHICH I HAD PASSED UPON THE ECONOMISTS A PUBLICIST AS LEARNED AS HE WAS MODEST LOVED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE SORROWS HE FELT
6880-216547-0068 HONORED BY THE POWER WHICH HE SOUGHT TO ENLIGHTEN WITHOUT FLATTERING OR DISGRACING IT
6880-216547-0069 MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY DEFENDER OF PROPERTY TOOK UP MY DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ASSOCIATES AND BEFORE THE MINISTRY
6880-216547-0070 AND SAVED ME FROM THE BLOWS OF A JUSTICE WHICH IS ALWAYS BLIND BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS IGNORANT
6880-216547-0071 A LETTER AS HONORABLE TO ITS AUTHOR AS IT IS FLATTERING TO HIM TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED PARIS MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE MONSIEUR
6880-216547-0072 I HASTEN TO THANK YOU FOR FORWARDING TO ME YOUR SECOND MEMOIR UPON PROPERTY I HAVE READ IT WITH ALL THE INTEREST THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FIRST WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT
6880-216547-0073 THE RUDENESS OF FORM WHICH GAVE TO A WORK OF SUCH GRAVITY THE MANNER AND APPEARANCE OF A PAMPHLET FOR YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME SIR AND YOUR TALENT WAS NEEDED TO REASSURE ME IN REGARD TO YOUR INTENTIONS
6880-216547-0074 THIS PROPOSITION NOW COMING INTO NOTICE PROPERTY IS ROBBERY WAS OF A NATURE TO REPEL FROM YOUR BOOK EVEN THOSE SERIOUS MINDS WHO DO NOT JUDGE BY APPEARANCES HAD YOU PERSISTED IN MAINTAINING IT
6880-216547-0075 IN ITS RUDE SIMPLICITY BUT IF YOU HAVE SOFTENED THE FORM YOU ARE NONE THE LESS FAITHFUL TO THE GROUND WORK OF YOUR DOCTRINES AND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO GIVE ME A SHARE IN THIS PERILOUS TEACHING
6880-216547-0076 I CANNOT ACCEPT A PARTNERSHIP WHICH AS FAR AS TALENT GOES WOULD SURELY BE A CREDIT TO ME BUT WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE ME IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS I AGREE WITH YOU IN ONE THING ONLY
6880-216547-0077 NAMELY THAT ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY GET TOO FREQUENTLY ABUSED IN THIS WORLD BUT I DO NOT REASON FROM THE ABUSE TO THE ABOLITION AN HEROIC REMEDY TOO MUCH LIKE DEATH
6880-216547-0078 WHICH CURES ALL EVILS I WILL GO FARTHER I WILL CONFESS THAT OF ALL ABUSES THE MOST HATEFUL TO ME ARE THOSE OF PROPERTY BUT ONCE MORE
6880-216547-0079 THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
6880-216547-0080 IT IS NOT WRONG TO EXAMINE IT CHANGE THEN THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE USE OF PROPERTY BUT BE SPARING OF ANATHEMAS FOR LOGICALLY WHERE IS THE HONEST MAN WHOSE HANDS ARE ENTIRELY CLEAN
6880-216547-0081 DO YOU THINK THAT ONE CAN BE A ROBBER WITHOUT KNOWING IT WITHOUT WISHING IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT DO YOU NOT ADMIT THAT SOCIETY IN ITS PRESENT STATE LIKE EVERY MAN
6880-216547-0082 HAS IN ITS CONSTITUTION ALL KINDS OF VIRTUES AND VICES INHERITED FROM OUR ANCESTORS IS PROPERTY THEN IN YOUR EYES A THING SO SIMPLE AND SO ABSTRACT THAT YOU CAN RE KNEAD AND EQUALIZE IT
6880-216547-0083 IF I MAY SO SPEAK IN YOUR METAPHYSICAL MILL ONE WHO HAS SAID AS MANY EXCELLENT AND PRACTICAL THINGS AS OCCUR IN THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL AND PARADOXICAL IMPROVISATIONS OF YOURS CANNOT BE A PURE AND UNWAVERING UTOPIST
6880-216547-0084 YOU ARE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ECONOMICAL AND ACADEMICAL PHRASEOLOGY TO PLAY WITH THE HARD WORDS OF REVOLUTIONS I BELIEVE THEN THAT YOU HAVE HANDLED PROPERTY
6880-216547-0085 AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
6880-216547-0086 THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
6880-216547-0087 WHAT CHAGRIN I SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE FELT IF THE KING'S COUNSEL THAT IS TO SAY THE INTELLECTUAL EXECUTIONER HAD FOLLOWED IN MY VERY TRACKS TO ATTACK YOUR BOOK AND ANNOY YOUR PERSON
6880-216547-0088 I ACTUALLY PASSED TWO TERRIBLE NIGHTS AND I SUCCEEDED IN RESTRAINING THE SECULAR ARM ONLY BY SHOWING THAT YOUR BOOK WAS AN ACADEMICAL DISSERTATION AND NOT THE MANIFESTO OF AN INCENDIARY
6880-216547-0089 YOUR STYLE IS TOO LOFTY EVER TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE MADMEN WHO IN DISCUSSING THE GRAVEST QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER USE PAVING STONES AS THEIR WEAPONS
6880-216547-0090 BUT SEE TO IT SIR THAT ERE LONG THEY DO NOT COME IN SPITE OF YOU TO SEEK FOR AMMUNITION IN THIS FORMIDABLE ARSENAL AND THAT YOUR VIGOROUS METAPHYSICS FALLS NOT INTO THE HANDS OF SOME SOPHIST OF THE MARKET PLACE
6880-216547-0091 WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
6880-216547-0092 BUT THE MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ORDER OF HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF EMBARRASSED IN ATTACKING CERTAIN ABUSES I LIKE TO REBUILD WITH ONE HAND WHEN I AM COMPELLED TO DESTROY WITH THE OTHER
6880-216547-0093 IN PRUNING AN OLD TREE WE GUARD AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF THE BUDS AND FRUIT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANY ONE YOU ARE A WISE AND LEARNED MAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHTFUL MIND
6880-216547-0094 THE TERMS BY WHICH YOU CHARACTERIZE THE FANATICS OF OUR DAY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO REASSURE THE MOST SUSPICIOUS IMAGINATIONS AS TO YOUR INTENTIONS BUT YOU CONCLUDE
6880-216547-0095 IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY YOU WISH TO ABOLISH THE MOST POWERFUL MOTOR OF THE HUMAN MIND YOU ATTACK THE PATERNAL SENTIMENT IN ITS SWEETEST ILLUSIONS WITH ONE WORD YOU ARREST THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL
6880-216547-0096 AND WE BUILD HENCEFORTH UPON THE SAND INSTEAD OF ON A ROCK THAT I CANNOT AGREE TO AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CRITICISED YOUR BOOK SO FULL OF BEAUTIFUL PAGES
6880-216547-0097 SO BRILLIANT WITH KNOWLEDGE AND FERVOR I WISH SIR THAT MY IMPAIRED HEALTH WOULD PERMIT ME TO EXAMINE WITH YOU PAGE BY PAGE THE MEMOIR WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO ADDRESS TO ME PUBLICLY AND PERSONALLY
6880-216547-0098 I DESIRE ALSO THE MERIT OF PRUDENCE YOU KNOW HOW DEEP SEATED IS THE DISEASE UNDER WHICH THE WORKING PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING I KNOW HOW MANY NOBLE HEARTS BEAT UNDER THOSE RUDE GARMENTS
6880-216547-0099 WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LABOR TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG I TRY TO SERVE AND ENLIGHTEN THEM WHEREAS SOME ENDEAVOR TO MISLEAD THEM
6880-216547-0100 YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY FOR THEM YOU HAVE ISSUED TWO MAGNIFICENT MANIFESTOES THE SECOND MORE GUARDED THAN THE FIRST ISSUE A THIRD MORE GUARDED THAN THE SECOND
6880-216547-0101 AND YOU WILL TAKE HIGH RANK IN SCIENCE WHOSE FIRST PRECEPT IS CALMNESS AND IMPARTIALITY FAREWELL SIR NO MAN'S ESTEEM FOR ANOTHER CAN EXCEED MINE FOR YOU BLANQUI
6880-216547-0102 I SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS NOBLE AND ELOQUENT LETTER BUT I CONFESS THAT I AM MORE INCLINED TO REALIZE THE PREDICTION WITH WHICH IT TERMINATES THAN TO AUGMENT NEEDLESSLY THE NUMBER OF MY ANTAGONISTS
6880-216547-0103 SO MUCH CONTROVERSY FATIGUES AND WEARIES ME THE INTELLIGENCE EXPENDED IN THE WARFARE OF WORDS IS LIKE THAT EMPLOYED IN BATTLE IT IS INTELLIGENCE WASTED
6880-216547-0104 I CALL PROPERTY
6880-216547-0105 TO EACH OF US PROPERTY SEEMS A POLYGON WHOSE ANGLES NEED KNOCKING OFF BUT THE OPERATION PERFORMED
6880-216547-0106 AN HYPOTHESIS ADMITTED IN MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH NOT PROVEN WHILE I CONSIDER THAT THIS FIGURE WILL BE A CIRCLE HONEST PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6880-216547-0107 FOR THE REST I ALLOW THAT IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION THE MIND MAY LEGITIMATELY HESITATE BEFORE DECIDING IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0108 TO GAIN THE VICTORY FOR ONE'S CAUSE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE SIMPLY TO OVERTHROW A PRINCIPLE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHICH HAS THE INDISPUTABLE MERIT OF SYSTEMATICALLY RECAPITULATING OUR POLITICAL THEORIES
6880-216547-0109 IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE AND TO FORMULATE THE SYSTEM WHICH MUST PROCEED FROM IT STILL FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM
6880-216547-0110 WILL SATISFY ALL THE MORAL AND POLITICAL NEEDS WHICH INDUCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THEN OF SUBSEQUENT EVIDENCE DEPENDS THE CORRECTNESS OF MY PRECEDING ARGUMENTS
6880-216547-0111 THE DISCOVERY OF A SYSTEM OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IN WHICH ALL EXISTING INSTITUTIONS SAVE PROPERTY OR THE SUM OF THE ABUSES OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0112 NOT ONLY MAY FIND A PLACE BUT MAY THEMSELVES SERVE AS INSTRUMENTS OF EQUALITY INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY THE DIVISION OF POWER THE PUBLIC MINISTRY THE JURY SYSTEM
6880-216547-0113 ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION THE UNITY AND COMPLETENESS OF INSTRUCTION MARRIAGE THE FAMILY HEREDITY IN DIRECT AND COLLATERAL SUCCESSION THE RIGHT OF SALE AND EXCHANGE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A WILL AND EVEN BIRTHRIGHT
6880-216547-0114 A SYSTEM WHICH BETTER THAN PROPERTY GUARANTEES THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL AND KEEPS UP THE COURAGE OF ALL
6880-216547-0115 THE ROAD THAT HE SHALL TRAVERSE WILL SUFFICE TO SHOW THE END
8975-270782-0000 THIRTEENTH LECTURE THE DREAM ARCHAIC REMNANTS AND INFANTILISM IN THE DREAM LET US REVERT TO OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE DREAM WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0001 TRANSFORMS THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS INTO SOME OTHER FORM OF EXPRESSION THE LATENT THOUGHTS ARE NO OTHER THAN THE CONSCIOUS THOUGHTS KNOWN TO US IN OUR WAKING HOURS THE NEW MODE OF EXPRESSION IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US BECAUSE OF ITS MANY SIDED FEATURES
8975-270782-0002 SO WE CALLED THE MODE OF EXPRESSION OF THE DREAM WORK THE ARCHAIC OR REGRESSIVE YOU MAY CONCLUDE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DEEPER STUDY OF THE DREAM WORK WE GAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATHER UNKNOWN BEGINNINGS OF OUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT I TRUST THIS WILL BE TRUE
8975-270782-0003 BUT THIS WORK HAS NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BEEN UNDERTAKEN THE ANTIQUITY INTO WHICH THE DREAM WORK CARRIES US BACK IS OF A DOUBLE ASPECT FIRSTLY THE INDIVIDUAL ANTIQUITY CHILDHOOD AND SECONDLY IN SO FAR AS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CHILDHOOD
8975-270782-0004 THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH PART OF THE LATENT PSYCHIC PROCEEDING HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL
8975-270782-0005 IN THIS CONNECTION IT APPEARS TO ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SYMBOLIC RELATIONS WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER LEARNED
8975-270782-0006 HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ARCHAIC CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DREAM YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES THE PECULIAR AMNESIA THAT IS LOSS OF MEMORY CONCERNING CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE FACT THAT THE FIRST YEARS TO THE FIFTH
8975-270782-0007 THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
8975-270782-0008 AND MAKES REMARKS WHICH YEARS LATER ARE RETOLD TO IT BUT WHICH IT HAS ITSELF ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN BESIDES THE MEMORY IN THE EARLY YEARS IS MORE FACILE BECAUSE IT IS LESS BURDENED THAN IN LATER YEARS
8975-270782-0009 NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR CONSIDERING THE MEMORY FUNCTION AS A PARTICULARLY HIGH OR DIFFICULT PSYCHIC PERFORMANCE IN FACT THE CONTRARY IS TRUE AND YOU CAN FIND A GOOD MEMORY IN PERSONS WHO STAND VERY LOW INTELLECTUALLY
8975-270782-0010 I MUST POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN WELL PRESERVED MEMORIES FOR THE MOST PART FORMATIVELY EXPERIENCED STAND FORTH IN THIS MEMORY VOID WHICH SURROUNDS THE FIRST YEARS OF CHILDHOOD AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS
8975-270782-0011 OUR MEMORY DEALS SELECTIVELY WITH ITS LATER MATERIALS WITH IMPRESSIONS WHICH COME TO US IN LATER LIFE IT RETAINS THE IMPORTANT AND DISCARDS THE UNIMPORTANT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE RETAINED CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
8975-270782-0012 THEY DO NOT BESPEAK NECESSARILY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES OF CHILDHOOD NOT EVEN SUCH AS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD NEED APPEAR OF IMPORTANCE THEY ARE OFTEN SO BANAL AND INTRINSICALLY SO MEANINGLESS THAT WE ASK OURSELVES IN WONDER WHY JUST THESE DETAILS
8975-270782-0013 HAVE ESCAPED BEING FORGOTTEN I ONCE ENDEAVORED TO APPROACH THE RIDDLE OF CHILDHOOD AMNESIA AND THE INTERRUPTED MEMORY REMNANTS WITH THE HELP OF ANALYSIS AND I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD TOO
8975-270782-0014 BY MEANS OF CAREFUL ANALYSIS ONE IS ABLE TO DEVELOP OUT OF THEM EVERYTHING THAT IS FORGOTTEN
8975-270782-0015 AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
8975-270782-0016 HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
8975-270782-0017 BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF THIS OCCUR IN LITERATURE AND I MYSELF CAN PRESENT SUCH AN EXAMPLE I ONCE DREAMED IN A CERTAIN CONNECTION OF A PERSON WHO MUST HAVE PERFORMED SOME SERVICE FOR ME AND WHOM I CLEARLY SAW HE WAS A ONE EYED MAN SHORT IN STATURE STOUT
8975-270782-0018 HIS HEAD DEEPLY SUNK INTO HIS NECK I CONCLUDED FROM THE CONTENT THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ASK MY MOTHER WHO WAS STILL LIVING HOW THE PHYSICIAN IN MY BIRTH PLACE WHICH I LEFT WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD LOOKED
8975-270782-0019 AND I LEARNED FROM HER THAT HE HAD ONE EYE WAS SHORT AND STOUT WITH HIS HEAD SUNK INTO HIS NECK AND ALSO LEARNED AT WHAT FORGOTTEN MISHAP HE HAD BEEN OF SERVICE TO ME THIS CONTROL OVER THE FORGOTTEN MATERIAL OF CHILDHOOD YEARS
8975-270782-0020 IS THEN A FURTHER ARCHAIC TENDENCY OF THE DREAM THE SAME INFORMATION MAY BE MADE USE OF IN ANOTHER OF THE PUZZLES THAT HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO US YOU WILL RECALL HOW ASTONISHED PEOPLE WERE
8975-270782-0021 WHEN WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STIMULI WHICH GAVE RISE TO DREAMS WERE EXTREMELY BAD AND LICENTIOUS SEXUAL DESIRES WHICH HAVE MADE DREAM CENSORSHIP AND DREAM DISTORTION NECESSARY AFTER WE HAVE INTERPRETED SUCH A DREAM FOR THE DREAMER AND HE
8975-270782-0022 IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
8975-270782-0023 WE NEED NOT HESITATE TO POINT OUT THIS ORIGIN THESE EVIL WISH IMPULSES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE PAST OFTEN IN A PAST WHICH IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY
8975-270782-0024 THE WOMAN WHOSE DREAM IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER DEAD DISCOVERS UNDER OUR GUIDANCE THAT SHE IN FACT AT ONE TIME ENTERTAINED THIS WISH
8975-270782-0025 WHICH EARLY ENDED IN A SEPARATION
8975-270782-0026 SHE BEAT HER BODY WITH HER FISTS IN A FIT OF ANGER IN ORDER TO KILL THE CHILD HOW MANY MOTHERS WHO TO DAY LOVE THEIR CHILDREN TENDERLY PERHAPS TOO TENDERLY RECEIVED THEM UNWILLINGLY AND AT THE TIME WISHED THAT THE LIFE WITHIN THEM WOULD NOT DEVELOP FURTHER
8975-270782-0027 INDEED TRANSLATED THIS WISH INTO VARIOUS ACTIONS HAPPILY HARMLESS THE LATER DEATH WISH AGAINST SOME LOVED ONE WHICH SEEMS SO STRANGE ALSO HAS ITS ORIGIN IN EARLY PHASES OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON
8975-270782-0028 THIS WISH WAS NO STRANGER TO HIM WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL A SUCKLING THIS MAN WHO WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF THE LITTLE BEING THAT MEANT NOTHING TO HIM WOULD DIE HE WOULD AGAIN BE FREE AND WOULD MAKE BETTER USE OF HIS FREEDOM
8975-270782-0029 THAT SUCH WISHES AND SUCH DREAMS CANNOT OCCUR
8975-270782-0030 ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE EXACT TERMS OF THE DREAM BUT THE MEANING THEREOF ACCORDING TO ITS INTERPRETATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE MANIFEST DREAM OF THE DEATH OF SOME LOVED PERSON HAS ONLY MADE USE OF SOME FRIGHTFUL MASK
8975-270782-0031 THAT IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OR THAT THE LOVED PERSON SERVES AS A CONCEALING SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OTHER BUT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CALL FORTH ANOTHER MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION YOU SAY GRANTED THIS DEATH WISH WAS PRESENT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER
8975-270782-0032 AND IS SUBSTANTIATED BY MEMORY YET THIS IS NO EXPLANATION IT IS LONG OUTLIVED TO DAY IT CAN BE PRESENT ONLY IN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND AS AN EMPTY EMOTIONLESS MEMORY BUT NOT AS A STRONG IMPULSE WHY SHOULD IT BE RECALLED BY THE DREAM AT ALL THIS QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED
8975-270782-0033 IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS OF DREAM STUDY BUT I MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF OUR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE RESTRAINT PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THE TEMPORARY ABSTENTION LET US BE SATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOF
8975-270782-0034 THAT THIS OUTLIVED WISH CAN BE SHOWN TO ACT AS A DREAM STIMULATOR AND LET US CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT OTHER EVIL WISHES ADMIT OF THE SAME DERIVATION OUT OF THE PAST LET US CONTINUE WITH THE REMOVAL OR DEATH WISH
8975-270782-0035 WHICH MOST FREQUENTLY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE UNBOUNDED EGOISM OF THE DREAMER
8975-270782-0036 AS OFTEN AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN IN OUR WAY IN LIFE AND HOW OFTEN MUST THIS HAPPEN IN THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS OF LIFE THE DREAM IS READY TO DO AWAY WITH HIM BE HE FATHER MOTHER BROTHER SISTER SPOUSE ET CETERA
8975-270782-0037 WE HAVE WONDERED SUFFICIENTLY OVER THIS EVIL TENDENCY OF HUMAN NATURE AND CERTAINLY WERE NOT PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS RESULT OF DREAM INTERPRETATION WITHOUT QUESTION AFTER IT HAS ONCE BEEN SUGGESTED TO US TO SEEK THE ORIGIN OF SUCH WISHES IN THE PAST
8975-270782-0038 OR REAL REMNANTS THEREOF SHOW THEMSELVES FOR THE CHILD LOVES ITSELF FIRST AND LATER LEARNS TO LOVE OTHERS TO SACRIFICE SOMETHING OF ITS EGO FOR ANOTHER
8975-270782-0039 EVEN THOSE PERSONS WHOM THE CHILD SEEMS TO LOVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT LOVES AT THE OUTSET BECAUSE IT HAS NEED OF THEM CANNOT DO WITHOUT THEM IN OTHERS WORDS OUT OF EGOISTICAL MOTIVES
8975-270782-0040 NOT UNTIL LATER DOES THE LOVE IMPULSE BECOME INDEPENDENT OF EGOISM IN BRIEF EGOISM HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD TO LOVE IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INSTRUCTIVE TO COMPARE THE CHILD'S REGARD
8975-270782-0041 FOR HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH THAT WHICH HE HAS FOR HIS PARENTS
8975-270782-0042 OFTEN ENOUGH THIS ATTITUDE IS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE TENDER FEELING OR RATHER LET US SAY GLOSSED OVER BUT THE HOSTILE FEELING APPEARS REGULARLY TO HAVE BEEN THE EARLIER IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE IN CHILDREN OF FROM TWO AND ONE HALF
8975-270782-0043 TO FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN A NEW LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER ARRIVES THE LATTER IS USUALLY RECEIVED IN A FAR FROM FRIENDLY MANNER EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS I DON'T WANT HIM LET THE STORK TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN ARE VERY USUAL
8975-270782-0044 SUBSEQUENTLY EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS MADE USE OF TO DISPARAGE THE NEW ARRIVAL AND EVEN ATTEMPTS TO DO HIM BODILY HARM DIRECT ATTACKS ARE NOT UNHEARD OF
8975-270782-0045 IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS LESS THE CHILD LEARNS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIVAL WITH INTENSE PSYCHIC ACTIVITY AND ACCOMMODATES HIMSELF TO THE NEW SITUATION IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS GREATER THE NEW CHILD MAY AWAKEN CERTAIN SYMPATHIES AS AN
8975-270782-0046 INTERESTING OBJECT AS A SORT OF LIVING DOLL AND IF THE DIFFERENCE IS EIGHT YEARS OR MORE MOTHERLY IMPULSES ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF GIRLS MAY COME INTO PLAY BUT TO BE TRUTHFUL WHEN WE DISCLOSE IN A DREAM THE WISH FOR THE DEATH OF A MOTHER OR SISTER
8975-270782-0047 WE NEED SELDOM FIND IT PUZZLING AND MAY TRACE ITS ORIGIN EASILY TO EARLY CHILDHOOD OFTEN ENOUGH ALSO TO THE PROPINQUITY OF LATER YEARS PROBABLY NO NURSERIES ARE FREE FROM MIGHTY CONFLICTS AMONG THE INHABITANTS
8975-270782-0048 THE MOTIVES ARE RIVALRY FOR THE LOVE OF THE PARENTS ARTICLES OWNED IN COMMON THE ROOM ITSELF THE HOSTILE IMPULSES ARE CALLED FORTH BY OLDER AS WELL AS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0049 IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO HATES A YOUNG ENGLISH LADY MORE THAN DOES HER MOTHER IT IS HER ELDER SISTER THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SAYING HOWEVER THAT AROUSES OUR ANTIPATHY WE CAN AT A PINCH UNDERSTAND HATRED OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0050 AND RIVALRY AMONG THEM BUT HOW MAY FEELINGS OF HATRED FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAUGHTER AND MOTHER PARENTS AND CHILDREN THIS RELATIONSHIP IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MORE FAVORABLE EVEN WHEN LOOKED AT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0051 THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
8975-270782-0052 WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
8975-270782-0053 THE FEELINGS BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR GROWN CHILDREN FAIL TO COME UP TO THE IDEAL ESTABLISHED BY SOCIETY HOW MUCH ENMITY EXISTS AND WOULD FIND EXPRESSION DID NOT ACCUMULATIONS OF PIETY AND OF TENDER IMPULSE HOLD THEM BACK THE MOTIVES FOR THIS ARE EVERYWHERE KNOWN
8975-270782-0054 AND DISCLOSE A TENDENCY TO SEPARATE THOSE OF THE SAME SEX DAUGHTER FROM MOTHER FATHER FROM SON THE DAUGHTER FINDS IN HER MOTHER THE AUTHORITY THAT HEMS IN HER WILL AND THAT IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF CAUSING HER TO CARRY OUT
8975-270782-0055 THE ABSTENTION FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY WHICH SOCIETY DEMANDS IN CERTAIN CASES ALSO SHE IS THE RIVAL WHO OBJECTS TO BEING DISPLACED THE SAME TYPE OF THING OCCURS IN A MORE GLARING MANNER BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
8975-270782-0056 TO THE SON THE FATHER IS THE EMBODIMENT OF EVERY SOCIAL RESTRICTION BORNE WITH SUCH GREAT OPPOSITION THE FATHER BARS THE WAY TO FREEDOM OF WILL TO EARLY SEXUAL SATISFACTION
8975-270782-0057 TO THE ENJOYMENT THEREOF IMPATIENT WAITING FOR THE DEATH OF THE FATHER GROWS TO HEIGHTS APPROXIMATING TRAGEDY IN THE CASE OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE THRONE LESS STRAINED IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND DAUGHTER MOTHER AND SON
8975-270782-0058 THE LATTER AFFORDS THE PUREST EXAMPLES OF AN UNALTERABLE TENDERNESS IN NO WAY DISTURBED BY EGOISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY DO I SPEAK OF THESE THINGS SO BANAL AND SO WELL KNOWN
8975-270782-0059 BECAUSE THERE IS AN UNMISTAKABLE DISPOSITION TO DENY THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN LIFE AND TO SET FORTH THE IDEAL DEMANDED BY SOCIETY AS A FULFILLED THING MUCH OFTENER THAN IT REALLY IS FULFILLED BUT IT IS PREFERABLE FOR PSYCHOLOGY TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
8975-270782-0060 RATHER THAN THAT THIS TASK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE CYNIC IN ANY EVENT THIS DENIAL REFERS ONLY TO ACTUAL LIFE THE ARTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMATIC POETRY ARE STILL FREE TO MAKE USE OF THE MOTIVES THAT RESULT FROM A DISTURBANCE OF THIS IDEAL
8975-270782-0061 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
8975-270782-0062 AS IN THE CASE OF THE DREAMER'S SYMPATHY FOR HIS FATHER'S UNNECESSARY SUFFERINGS IN EXAMPLE THREE IT IS SELDOM THAT THE ENMITY ALONE CONTROLS THE RELATIONSHIP MUCH MORE OFTEN IT RECEDES BEHIND MORE TENDER IMPULSES
8975-270782-0063 BY WHICH IT IS SUPPRESSED AND MUST WAIT UNTIL A DREAM ISOLATES IT THAT WHICH THE DREAM SHOWS US IN ENLARGED FORM AS A RESULT OF SUCH ISOLATION SHRINKS TOGETHER AGAIN AFTER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DOCKETED IN ITS RELATION TO LIFE AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERPRETATION
8975-270782-0064 H SACHS BUT WE ALSO FIND THIS DREAM WISH IN PLACES WHERE IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH LIFE AND WHERE THE ADULT IN HIS WAKING HOURS WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE IT THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE DEEPEST AND MOST UNIFORM MOTIVE FOR BECOMING UNFRIENDLY
8975-270782-0065 ESPECIALLY BETWEEN PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX HAS ALREADY MADE ITS INFLUENCE FELT IN EARLIEST CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE LOVE RIVALRY WITH THE ESPECIAL EMPHASIS OF THE SEX CHARACTER THE SON EVEN AS A SMALL CHILD
8975-270782-0066 WHO IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN HER TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER AND WHO OCCUPIES A POSITION THAT SHE COULD VERY WELL FILL HERSELF ONE LEARNS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS TO WHAT EARLY YEARS THESE IDEAS EXTEND BACK
8975-270782-0067 IDEAS WHICH WE DESIGNATE AS THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX BECAUSE THIS MYTH REALIZES WITH A VERY SLIGHTLY WEAKENED EFFECT THE TWO EXTREME WISHES WHICH GROW OUT OF THE SITUATION OF THE SON TO KILL HIS FATHER AND TAKE HIS MOTHER TO WIFE
8975-270782-0068 I DO NOT WISH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX COVERS ENTIRELY THE RELATION OF THE CHILD TO ITS PARENTS THIS RELATION CAN BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FURTHERMORE THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX IS MORE OR LESS WELL DEVELOPED IT MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE A REVERSAL
8975-270782-0069 BUT IT IS A CUSTOMARY AND VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD AND ONE TENDS RATHER TO UNDERESTIMATE THAN TO OVERESTIMATE ITS INFLUENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY FOLLOW FROM IT IN ADDITION
8975-270782-0070 CHILDREN FREQUENTLY REACT TO THE OEDIPUS IDEA THROUGH STIMULATION BY THE PARENTS WHO IN THE PLACING OF THEIR AFFECTION ARE OFTEN LED BY SEX DIFFERENCES SO THAT THE FATHER PREFERS THE DAUGHTER THE MOTHER THE SON
8975-270782-0071 AND THIS LOVE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTWORN LOVE ONE CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT THE WORLD WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO PSYCHOANALYTIC RESEARCH FOR ITS DISCOVERY OF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX ON THE CONTRARY IT CALLED FORTH THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF ADULTS
8975-270782-0072 AND PERSONS WHO HAD NEGLECTED TO TAKE PART IN DENYING THIS PROSCRIBED OR TABOOED FEELING RELATIONSHIP LATER MADE GOOD THE OMISSION BY TAKING ALL VALUE FROM THE COMPLEX THROUGH FALSE INTERPRETATIONS ACCORDING TO MY UNCHANGED CONVICTION
8975-270782-0073 CAST OUT OF LIFE WAS YIELDED UP TO POETRY AND GIVEN THE FREEST PLAY O RANK HAS SHOWN IN A CAREFUL STUDY HOW THIS VERY OEDIPUS COMPLEX HAS SUPPLIED DRAMATIC LITERATURE
8975-270782-0074 WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MOTIVES IN UNENDING VARIATIONS DERIVATIONS AND DISGUISES ALSO IN DISTORTED FORMS SUCH AS WE RECOGNIZE TO BE THE WORK OF A CENSOR WE MAY ALSO ASCRIBE THIS OEDIPUS COMPLEX TO THOSE DREAMERS
8975-270782-0075 WHO WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESCAPE IN LATER LIFE THESE CONFLICTS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED THEREWITH WE FIND WHAT WE CALL THE CASTRATION COMPLEX THE REACTION TO SEXUAL INTIMIDATION OR RESTRICTION ASCRIBED TO THE FATHER
8975-270782-0076 BY APPLYING OUR FORMER RESEARCHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND THAT THE ORIGIN OF OTHER FORBIDDEN DREAM WISHES OF EXCESSIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES MAY BE EXPLAINED IN THE SAME MANNER
8975-270782-0077 THUS WE ARE MOVED TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEX LIFE IN THE CHILD ALSO AND WE DISCOVER THE FOLLOWING FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS A MISTAKE TO DENY THAT THE CHILD HAS A SEXUAL LIFE AND TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
8975-270782-0078 THAT SEXUALITY COMMENCES WITH THE RIPENING OF THE GENITALS AT THE TIME OF PUBERTY ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILD HAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A SEXUAL LIFE RICH IN CONTENT AND DIFFERING IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS
8975-270782-0079 WHAT WE CALL PERVERSE IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS FIRST IN DISREGARD FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF SPECIES THE GULF BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL SECOND
8975-270782-0080 BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE CONVENTIONAL FEELING OF DISGUST THIRD THE INCEST LIMITATION BEING PROHIBITED FROM SEEKING SEXUAL SATISFACTION WITH NEAR BLOOD RELATIONS FOURTH HOMOSEXUALITY AND FIFTH
8975-270782-0081 HE KNOWS NO UNBRIDGABLE CHASM BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL THE ARROGANCE WITH WHICH MAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM THE ANIMAL IS A LATER ACQUISITION IN THE BEGINNING HE IS NOT DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF EXCREMENT BUT SLOWLY LEARNS TO BE SO DISGUSTED
8975-270782-0082 UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EDUCATION HE LAYS NO SPECIAL STRESS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES RATHER ACCREDITS TO BOTH THE SAME GENITAL FORMATION
8975-270782-0083 TOWARD THOSE PERSONS CLOSEST TO HIM AND WHO ARE DEAR TO HIM FOR VARIOUS REASONS HIS PARENTS BROTHERS AND SISTERS NURSES AND FINALLY YOU MAY OBSERVE IN HIM THAT WHICH LATER BREAKS THROUGH AGAIN RAISED NOW TO A LOVE ATTRACTION
8975-270782-0084 POLYMORPHUS PERVERSE AND IF HE MAKES BUT SLIGHT USE OF ALL THESE IMPULSES IT IS ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE OF THEIR LESSER INTENSITY AS COMPARED TO LATER LIFE AND ON THE OTHER HAND
8975-270782-0085 AND TO DISGUISE ANOTHER PART BY MISREPRESENTING ITS SEXUAL NATURE UNTIL THEY CAN DENY THE WHOLE BUSINESS THESE ARE OFTEN THE SAME PERSONS WHO DISCOURSE VIOLENTLY AGAINST ALL THE SEXUAL FAULTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0086 AND THEN AT THE WRITING TABLE DEFEND THE SEXUAL PURITY OF THE SAME CHILDREN WHERE CHILDREN ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES OR ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CORRUPTION
8975-270782-0087 OF PERVERSE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO BE SURE THE GROWN UPS ARE RIGHT IN LOOKING UPON THESE THINGS AS CHILDISH PERFORMANCES AS PLAY FOR THE CHILD IS NOT TO BE JUDGED AS MATURE AND ANSWERABLE EITHER BEFORE THE BAR OF CUSTOM OR BEFORE THE LAW
8975-270782-0088 BUT THESE THINGS DO EXIST THEY HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS INDICATIONS OF INNATE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS CAUSES AND FURTHERANCES OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO CHILDHOOD SEX LIFE AND THEREBY INTO THE SEX LIFE OF MAN
8975-270782-0089 WHEN WE REDISCOVER IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR DISTORTED DREAMS ALL THESE PERVERSE WISH IMPULSES IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE DREAM HAS IN THIS FIELD
8975-270782-0090 THOSE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW WHAT ANTIPATHY SOCIETY FEELS TOWARD SUCH INTERCOURSE OR AT LEAST PRETENDS TO FEEL AND WHAT WEIGHT IS LAID ON THE PROHIBITIONS DIRECTED AGAINST IT
8975-270782-0091 THE MOST MONSTROUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THIS FEAR OF INCEST SOME HAVE BELIEVED THAT IT IS DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY FORESIGHT ON THE PART OF NATURE WHICH IS PSYCHICALLY REPRESENTED BY THIS PROHIBITION BECAUSE INBREEDING WOULD DETERIORATE THE RACE CHARACTER
8975-270782-0092 OTHERS MAINTAINED THAT BECAUSE OF HAVING LIVED TOGETHER SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD THE SEXUAL DESIRE IS DIVERTED FROM THE PERSONS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN BOTH CASES FURTHERMORE THE INCEST AVOIDANCE WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY ASSURED
8975-270782-0093 AND MOST CUSTOMARY CHOICE AND THAT NOT UNTIL LATER IS THERE ANY RESISTANCE THE SOURCE OF WHICH PROBABLY IS TO BE FOUND IN THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY
8975-270782-0094 TOWARD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DREAM WE FOUND NOT ONLY THAT THE MATERIALS OF FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DREAM
8975-270782-0095 WITH ALL ITS PECULIARITIES ITS EGOISM ITS INCESTUOUS LOVE CHOICE ET CETERA CONTINUES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DREAM IN THE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0096 INFANTILE SIDE OF PSYCHIC LIFE WHICH WE MAY FIND IN ACTION IN CHILDREN WHICH WE OVERLOOK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTNESS OF ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS LIGHTLY CONSIDERED SINCE WE DEMAND NO ETHICAL HEIGHTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0097 SINCE THE DREAM REGRESSES TO THIS STAGE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE APPARENT THE EVIL THAT LIES IN US BUT IT IS ONLY A DECEPTIVE APPEARANCE BY WHICH WE HAVE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED WE ARE NOT SO EVIL AS WE MIGHT SUSPECT FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
8975-270782-0098 IF THE EVIL IMPULSES OF THE DREAM ARE MERELY INFANTILISM A RETURN TO THE BEGINNINGS OF OUR ETHICAL DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE DREAM SIMPLY MAKES CHILDREN OF US AGAIN IN THINKING AND IN FEELING WE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED OF THESE EVIL DREAMS IF WE ARE REASONABLE
8975-270782-0099 BUT BEING REASONABLE IS ONLY A PART OF PSYCHIC LIFE MANY THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE THERE THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE ASHAMED OF SUCH DREAMS AND UNREASONABLY WE TURN THEM OVER TO THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0100 ARE ASHAMED AND ANGRY IF ONE OF THESE DREAMS HAS IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN UNDISTORTED FORM
8975-270782-0101 AS WE WOULD BE IF WE UNDERSTOOD IT JUST THINK OF THE SCANDALIZED OPINION OF THE FINE OLD LADY ABOUT HER UNINTERPRETED DREAM OF SERVICES OF LOVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED
8975-270782-0102 AND IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT UPON FURTHER STUDY OF THE EVIL IN THE DREAM WE SHALL COME TO SOME OTHER DECISION AND ARRIVE AT ANOTHER VALUATION OF HUMAN NATURE AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE GRASP TWO FACTS
8975-270782-0103 WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
8975-270782-0104 BUT IT REAWAKENS THE PECULIARITIES OF OUR PRIMITIVE PSYCHIC LIFE THE ANCIENT PREDOMINANCE OF THE EGO THE EARLIEST IMPULSES OF OUR SEXUAL LIFE EVEN OUR OLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
8975-270782-0105 UNCONSCIOUS IS NO LONGER A NAME FOR WHAT IS AT THAT TIME LATENT THE UNCONSCIOUS IS AN ESPECIAL PSYCHIC REALM WITH WISH IMPULSES OF ITS OWN WITH ITS OWN METHOD OF EXPRESSION AND WITH A PSYCHIC MECHANISM PECULIAR TO ITSELF
8975-270782-0106 BUT THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS WHICH WE HAVE SOLVED BY MEANS OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION ARE NOT OF THIS REALM THEY ARE MUCH MORE NEARLY THE SAME AS ANY WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IN OUR WAKING HOURS STILL THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0107 HOW DOES ONE SOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES IN OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE AND THAT SHARES ITS CHARACTERISTICS
8975-270782-0108 THE DAY REMNANTS COMBINES IN THE DREAM FABRICATION
8975-270782-0109 BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTS THE DREAM WORK COMPLETES ITSELF THE INFLUENCING OF THE DAY REMNANTS BY THE UNCONSCIOUS NECESSITATES REGRESSION THIS IS THE DEEPEST INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE DREAM
8975-270782-0110 THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN WITHOUT HAVING SEARCHED THROUGH FURTHER PSYCHIC REALMS THE TIME WILL SOON COME HOWEVER WHEN WE SHALL CLOTHE THE UNCONSCIOUS CHARACTER OF THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHT WITH ANOTHER NAME
8975-270782-0111 WHICH SHALL DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF THE REALM OF THE INFANTILE WE MAY TO BE SURE PROPOUND THE QUESTION WHAT FORCES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP TO SUCH REGRESSION
8975-270782-0112 WHY DO NOT THE SLEEP DISTURBING PSYCHIC STIMULI DO THE JOB WITHOUT IT AND IF THEY MUST BECAUSE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP DISGUISE THEMSELVES THROUGH OLD FORMS OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE NO LONGER COMPREHENSIBLE
8975-270782-0113 WHAT IS THE USE OF GIVING NEW LIFE TO OLD LONG OUTGROWN PSYCHIC STIMULI WISHES AND CHARACTER TYPES THAT IS WHY THE MATERIAL REGRESSION IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL THE ONLY SATISFACTORY ANSWER WOULD BE THIS
8975-270782-0114 THAT ONLY IN THIS MANNER CAN A DREAM BE BUILT UP
446-123502-0000 CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
446-123502-0001 MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A SHORT TIME WE GAINED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER TRAVERSING A NARROW GORGE CAME TO AN OPEN VALLEY AT THE FAR EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS A LOW TABLE LAND UPON WHICH I BEHELD
446-123502-0002 AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
446-123502-0003 UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
446-123502-0004 TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
446-123502-0005 FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
446-123502-0006 IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
446-123502-0007 THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
446-123502-0008 WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
446-123502-0009 ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
446-123502-0010 IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
446-123502-0011 THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
446-123502-0012 OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
446-123502-0013 AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
446-123502-0014 WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
446-123502-0015 STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
446-123502-0016 IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
446-123502-0017 TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
446-123502-0018 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0019 GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
446-123502-0020 ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
446-123502-0021 WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
446-123502-0022 NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
446-123502-0023 AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
446-123502-0024 MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
446-123502-0025 AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
446-123502-0026 HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
446-123502-0027 AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
446-123502-0028 BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
446-123502-0029 THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
446-123502-0030 OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
446-123502-0031 IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
446-123502-0032 THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
446-123502-0033 AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
446-123502-0034 AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
446-123502-0035 AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
446-123502-0036 MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
446-123502-0037 WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
446-123502-0038 BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
446-123502-0039 I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
446-123502-0040 WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
446-123502-0041 WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
446-123502-0042 WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
446-123502-0043 TARS TARKAS AND THE CHIEF EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS AND THE FORMER CALLING TO A YOUNG FEMALE AMONG THE THRONG GAVE HER SOME INSTRUCTIONS AND MOTIONED ME TO ACCOMPANY HER
446-123502-0044 I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
446-123502-0045 SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
446-123502-0046 IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
446-123502-0047 AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
446-123502-0048 MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
446-123502-0049 LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
7859-102519-0000 WAS A SOVEREIGN OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM ANY EMPEROR THAT WE HAVE YET ENCOUNTERED IN THE ANNALS OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE HE WAS A BOLD RECKLESS CALLOUS AND SELFISH YOUNG MAN
7859-102519-0001 HE WAS IN SHORT OF THE STUFF OF WHICH TYRANTS ARE MADE JUSTINIAN WAS BUT SEVENTEEN WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE BUT HE SOON SHOWED THAT HE INTENDED TO RULE THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE
7859-102519-0002 LONG BEFORE HE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF STATE CRAFT ERE HE HAD REACHED HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR JUSTINIAN HAD PLUNGED INTO WAR WITH THE BULGARIANS HE ATTACKED THEM SUDDENLY INFLICTED SEVERAL DEFEATS ON THEIR KING
7859-102519-0003 AND TOOK NO LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PRISONERS WHOM HE SENT OVER TO ASIA AND FORCED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY OF ARMENIA
7859-102519-0004 BEARING VERSES OF THE KORAN JUSTINIAN REFUSED TO RECEIVE THEM AND DECLARED WAR HIS SECOND VENTURE IN THE FIELD WAS DISASTROUS HIS UNWILLING RECRUITS FROM BULGARIA DESERTED TO THE ENEMY WHEN HE MET THE SARACENS AT SEBASTOPOLIS
7859-102519-0005 AND THE ROMAN ARMY WAS ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE TWO SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL
7859-102519-0006 JUSTINIAN'S WARS DEPLETED HIS TREASURY YET HE PERSISTED IN PLUNGING INTO EXPENSIVE SCHEMES OF BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS DRIVEN TO COLLECT MONEY BY THE MOST RECKLESS EXTORTION HE EMPLOYED TWO UNSCRUPULOUS MINISTERS THEODOTUS
7859-102519-0007 THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL AN EX ABBOT WHO HAD DESERTED HIS MONASTERY AND THE EUNUCH STEPHANUS THE KEEPER OF THE PRIVY PURSE THESE MEN WERE TO JUSTINIAN WHAT RALPH FLAMBARD WAS TO WILLIAM RUFUS
7859-102519-0008 THEY RAISED HIM FUNDS BY FLAGRANT EXTORTION AND ILLEGAL STRETCHING OF THE LAW BOTH WERE VIOLENT AND CRUEL THEODOTUS IS SAID TO HAVE HUNG RECALCITRANT TAX PAYERS UP BY ROPES ABOVE SMOKY FIRES TILL THEY WERE NEARLY STIFLED
7859-102519-0009 STEPHANUS THRASHED AND STONED EVERY ONE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED A WHIPPING TO THE EMPRESS DOWAGER DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER SON AND JUSTINIAN DID NOT PUNISH HIM WHEN HE RETURNED
7859-102519-0010 WHILE THE EMPEROR'S FINANCIAL EXPEDIENTS WERE MAKING HIM HATED BY THE MONEYED CLASSES HE WAS RENDERING HIMSELF NO LESS UNPOPULAR IN THE ARMY
7859-102519-0011 HE BEGAN TO EXECUTE OR IMPRISON HIS OFFICERS AND TO DECIMATE HIS BEATEN TROOPS TO BE EMPLOYED BY HIM IN HIGH COMMAND WAS ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS IT WAS TO BE APPOINTED A GENERAL IN CHIEF DURING THE DICTATORSHIP OF ROBESPIERRE
7859-102519-0012 GENERAL OF THE THEME OF HELLAS WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO ASSUME HIS COMMAND AS HE PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS HE EXCLAIMED THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED AND THAT HE SHOULD BE EXPECTING THE ORDER FOR HIS EXECUTION TO ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT THEN A CERTAIN MONK NAMED PAUL STOOD FORTH
7859-102519-0013 AND BADE HIM SAVE HIMSELF BY A BOLD STROKE IF HE WOULD AIM A BLOW AT JUSTINIAN HE WOULD FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY READY TO FOLLOW HIM
7859-102519-0014 AND RUSHING TO THE STATE PRISON AT THE HEAD OF A FEW FRIENDS BROKE IT OPEN AND LIBERATED SOME HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS A MOB JOINED HIM HE SEIZED THE CATHEDRAL OF SAINT SOPHIA
7859-102519-0015 NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
7859-102519-0016 AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
7859-102519-0017 THE NEW EMPEROR WAS NOT A MAN OF CAPACITY AND HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO REBELLION BY HIS FEARS RATHER THAN HIS AMBITION HE HELD THE THRONE BARELY THREE YEARS AMID CONSTANT REVOLTS AT HOME AND DEFEATS ABROAD
7859-102519-0018 THE ASIATIC FRONTIER WAS RAVAGED BY THE ARMIES OF ABDALMALIK AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT DISASTER BEFEL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0019 WHERE THE ROMANS HAD STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES BY HARD FIGHTING
7859-102519-0020 HIS TROOPS GAINED SEVERAL VICTORIES OVER THE SARACENS
7859-102519-0021 AND EVEN INVADED NORTHERN SYRIA
7859-102519-0022 THE PEOPLE AND ARMY WERE OUT OF HAND THE EPHEMERAL EMPEROR COULD COUNT ON NO LOYALTY AND ANY SHOCK WAS SUFFICIENT TO UPSET HIS PRECARIOUS THRONE WE MUST NOW TURN TO THE BANISHED JUSTINIAN
7859-102519-0023 WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO EXILE WITH HIS NOSE MUTILATED HE HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO CHERSON THE GREEK TOWN IN THE CRIMEA CLOSE TO THE MODERN SEBASTOPOL WHICH FORMED THE NORTHERNMOST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
7859-102519-0024 AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
7859-102519-0025 THE TARTAR TRIBE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SEA OF AZOF WITH THIS PRINCE THE EXILE SO INGRATIATED HIMSELF THAT HE RECEIVED IN MARRIAGE HIS SISTER WHO WAS BAPTIZED AND CHRISTENED THEODORA
7859-102519-0026 TO INDUCE HIM TO SURRENDER JUSTINIAN AND THE TREACHEROUS BARBARIAN DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE BRIBE AND SENT SECRET ORDERS TO TWO OF HIS OFFICERS
7859-102519-0027 THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
7859-102519-0028 AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
7859-102519-0029 WHILE THEY WERE OUT AT SEA A STORM AROSE AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO FILL ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CRIED TO JUSTINIAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD AND PARDON HIS ENEMIES ERE HE DIED BUT THE EMPEROR'S STERN SOUL WAS NOT BENT BY THE TEMPEST
7859-102519-0030 MAY GOD DROWN ME HERE HE ANSWERED
7859-102519-0031 THE BOAT WEATHERED THE STORM AND JUSTINIAN SURVIVED TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL OATH HE CAME ASHORE IN THE LAND OF THE BULGARIANS AND SOON WON FAVOUR WITH THEIR KING TERBEL WHO WANTED A GOOD EXCUSE FOR INVADING THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0032 AND FOUND IT IN THE PRETENCE OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED MONARCH WITH A BULGARIAN ARMY AT HIS BACK JUSTINIAN APPEARED BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0033 THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
7859-102519-0034 SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
7859-102519-0035 AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
7859-102519-0036 AS HE TRIED TO FLEE INTO ASIA JUSTINIAN HAD THEM LED ROUND THE CITY IN CHAINS AND THEN BOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE HIS THRONE IN THE CATHISMA THE IMPERIAL BOX AT THE HIPPODROME
7859-102519-0037 THERE HE SAT IN STATE USING THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES AS A FOOTSTOOL WHILE HIS ADHERENTS CHANTED THE VERSE FROM THE NINETY FIRST PSALM THOU SHALT TREAD ON THE LION AND ASP THE YOUNG LION AND DRAGON SHALT THOU TRAMPLE UNDER THY FEET
7859-102519-0038 AND APSIMARUS AFTER THIS STRANGE EXHIBITION THE TWO EX EMPERORS WERE BEHEADED THEIR EXECUTION BEGAN A REIGN OF TERROR FOR JUSTINIAN HAD HIS OATH TO KEEP AND WAS SET ON WREAKING VENGEANCE ON EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN HIS DEPOSITION
7859-102519-0039 AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE PATRIARCH WHO HAD CROWNED HIM THEN HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT OUT MEANER VICTIMS MANY PROMINENT CITIZENS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE SOWN UP IN SACKS AND DROWNED IN THE BOSPHORUS SOLDIERS WERE PICKED OUT BY THE DOZEN AND BEHEADED
7859-102519-0040 A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
7859-102519-0041 THESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGN
7859-102519-0042 THE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUS
7859-102519-0043 WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0044 THE SIX YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE PURELY ANARCHICAL JUSTINIAN'S WILD AND WICKED FREAKS HAD COMPLETED THE DEMORALIZATION WHICH HAD ALREADY SET IN BEFORE HIS RESTORATION EVERYTHING IN THE ARMY AND THE STATE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED AND OUT OF GEAR
7859-102519-0045 IT REQUIRED A HERO TO RESTORE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND EVOLVE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS BUT THE HERO WAS NOT AT ONCE FORTHCOMING AND THE CONFUSION WENT ON INCREASING
7859-102519-0046 TO REPLACE JUSTINIAN BY PHILIPPICUS WAS ONLY TO SUBSTITUTE KING LOG FOR KING STORK THE NEW EMPEROR WAS A MERE MAN OF PLEASURE AND SPENT HIS TIME IN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT LETTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SLIDE ON AS BEST THEY MIGHT
7859-102519-0047 IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE WAS UPSET BY A CONSPIRACY
7859-102519-0048 PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
7859-102519-0049 WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
7859-102519-0050 AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
7859-102519-0051 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
7859-102519-0052 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
7859-102519-0053 THEY HAD PENETRATED INTO PHRYGIA
7859-102519-0054 WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
7859-102519-0055 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
7859-102519-0056 TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
7859-102521-0000 THE ICONOCLASTS
7859-102521-0001 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
7859-102521-0002 HISTORIANS HAVE GIVEN TO THE SCHEME OF REFORM WHICH HE TOOK IN HAND THE NAME OF THE ICONOCLASTIC MOVEMENT BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES WHICH FORMED ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURES OF HIS ACTION
7859-102521-0003 FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN DECLINING IN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION LITERATURE AND ART SEEMED LIKELY TO PERISH IN THE NEVER ENDING CLASH OF ARMS THE OLD ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WAS BEING FORGOTTEN
7859-102521-0004 THE RACE OF EDUCATED CIVIL SERVANTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTINCTION THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES WERE NOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION ROUGH SOLDIERS NOT MEMBERS OF THAT OLD BUREAUCRACY WHOSE ROMAN TRADITIONS HAD SO LONG KEPT THE EMPIRE TOGETHER
7859-102521-0005 NOT LEAST AMONG THE SIGNS OF A DECAYING CIVILIZATION WERE THE GROSS SUPERSTITIONS WHICH HAD GROWN UP OF LATE IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
7859-102521-0006 UNNOTICED AND UNGUARDED AGAINST BY THEOLOGIANS WHO DEVOTED ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BARREN MONOTHELITE AND MONOPHYSITE CONTROVERSIES IMAGE WORSHIP AND RELIC WORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAD DEVELOPED WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AND ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF MERE FETISHISM
7859-102521-0007 SLAVS AND BULGARIANS ALL OF WHOM HE BEAT BACK WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ON THE NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHEN THEY INVADED THE EMPIRE BUT IN THE MINDS BOTH OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF AND OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HIS DEALINGS WITH THINGS RELIGIOUS WERE THE MAIN FEATURE OF HIS REIGN
7859-102521-0008 AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGUN TO CLOSE MONASTERIES WHOLESALE WE ARE TOLD THAT HE COMPELLED MANY OF THEIR INMATES TO MARRY BY FORCE OF THREATS OTHERS WERE EXILED TO CYPRUS BY THE HUNDRED NOT A FEW WERE FLOGGED AND IMPRISONED
7859-102521-0009 THESE UNWISE MEASURES HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT THE MONKS WERE EVERYWHERE REGARDED AS MARTYRS AND THE IMAGE WORSHIP WHICH THEY SUPPORTED GREW MORE THAN EVER POPULAR WITH THE MASSES WHILE STILL IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF HIS PERSECUTING ENTHUSIASM
7859-102521-0010 WHILE THE EMPRESS DOWAGER IRENE BECAME SOLE REGENT AND HER NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF HER SON IN ALL ACTS OF STATE
7859-102521-0011 BUT IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR HE REBELLED AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S DICTATION AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HELM OF THE STATE IRENE HAD ACTUALLY STRIVEN TO OPPOSE HIM BY ARMED FORCE BUT HE PARDONED HER AND AFTER SECLUDING HER FOR A SHORT TIME
7859-102521-0012 RESTORED HER TO HER FORMER DIGNITY THE UNNATURAL MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN HER SON'S ELEVATION
7859-102521-0013 SEIZED THE YOUNG EMPEROR BLINDED HIM AND IMMURED HIM IN A MONASTERY BEFORE ANY OF HIS ADHERENTS WERE ABLE TO COME TO HIS AID
7859-102521-0014 HER GRAND TREASURER HAVING GAINED OVER SOME OF THE EUNUCHS AND OTHER COURTIERS ABOUT HER PERSON
7859-102521-0015 THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
7859-102521-0016 AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
7859-102521-0017 THERE WAS OF COURSE NO LEGALITY IN THE ACT AND KARL THE GREAT WAS IN NO REAL SENSE THE SUCCESSOR OF HONORIUS AND ROMULUS AUGUSTULUS BUT HE RULED A GROUP OF KINGDOMS WHICH EMBRACED THE LARGER HALF OF THE OLD WESTERN EMPIRE AND FORMED A FAIR EQUIPOISE TO THE REALM NOW RULED BY IRENE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED THEN ONWARD WE HAVE ONCE MORE A WEST ROMAN EMPIRE IN EXISTENCE AS WELL AS THE EAST ROMAN
1743-142914-0000 HE WASN'T READY TO GO BACK HOME TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH YET THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE TO DO FOR EVERYBODY IN THE OLD ORCHARD WAS TOO BUSY FOR IDLE GOSSIP PETER SCRATCHED A LONG EAR WITH A LONG HIND FOOT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME PLACE TO GO
1743-142914-0001 I'LL JUST RUN OVER AND PAY MY RESPECTS TO GRANDFATHER FROG AND TO REDWING THE BLACKBIRD REDWING WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BIRDS TO ARRIVE AND I'VE NEGLECTED HIM SHAMEFULLY WHEN PETER THINKS OF SOMETHING TO DO HE WASTES NO TIME
1743-142914-0002 OFF HE STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR THE SMILING POOL HE KEPT CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST UNTIL HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK COMES OUT OF THE GREEN FOREST ON ITS WAY TO THE SMILING POOL IN THE GREEN MEADOWS
1743-142914-0003 BUSHES AND YOUNG TREES GROW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LAUGHING BROOK AT THIS POINT THE GROUND WAS SOFT IN PLACES QUITE MUDDY PETER DOESN'T MIND GETTING HIS FEET DAMP SO HE HOPPED ALONG CARELESSLY
1743-142914-0004 FROM RIGHT UNDER HIS VERY NOSE SOMETHING SHOT UP INTO THE AIR WITH A WHISTLING SOUND IT STARTLED PETER SO THAT HE STOPPED SHORT WITH HIS EYES POPPING OUT OF HIS HEAD
1743-142914-0005 HE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF A BROWN FORM DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF SOME TALL BUSHES THEN PETER CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0006 HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THEN YOU ARE EVEN SAID A VOICE CLOSE AT HAND YOU SCARED HIM I SAW YOU COMING BUT LONGBILL DIDN'T PETER TURNED QUICKLY THERE WAS MISSUS WOODCOCK PEEPING AT HIM FROM BEHIND A TUSSOCK OF GRASS
1743-142914-0007 I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE HIM APOLOGIZED PETER I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO YOU THINK HE WAS REALLY VERY MUCH SCARED
1743-142914-0008 I RECOGNIZED YOU JUST AS I WAS DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES SO I CAME RIGHT BACK I LEARNED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN STARTLED IT IS BEST TO FLY FIRST AND FIND OUT AFTERWARDS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS REAL DANGER
1743-142914-0009 I AM GLAD IT IS NO ONE BUT YOU PETER FOR I WAS HAVING A SPLENDID MEAL HERE AND I SHOULD HAVE HATED TO LEAVE IT YOU'LL EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO ON EATING I HOPE WE CAN TALK BETWEEN BITES
1743-142914-0010 CERTAINLY I'LL EXCUSE YOU REPLIED PETER STARING AROUND VERY HARD TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE LONGBILL WAS MAKING SUCH A GOOD MEAL OF BUT PETER COULDN'T SEE A THING THAT LOOKED GOOD TO EAT THERE WASN'T EVEN A BUG OR A WORM CRAWLING ON THE GROUND
1743-142914-0011 LONGBILL TOOK TWO OR THREE STEPS IN RATHER A STATELY FASHION PETER HAD TO HIDE A SMILE FOR LONGBILL HAD SUCH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE YET AT THE SAME TIME WAS SUCH AN ODD LOOKING FELLOW
1743-142914-0012 HE WAS QUITE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS TAIL WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE SHORT AND HIS NECK WAS SHORT BUT HIS BILL WAS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
1743-142914-0013 HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
1743-142914-0014 HIS EYES WERE VERY BIG AND THEY WERE SET SO FAR BACK THAT PETER WONDERED IF IT WASN'T EASIER FOR HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM THAN IN FRONT OF HIM SUDDENLY LONGBILL PLUNGED HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND HE PLUNGED IT IN FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH
1743-142914-0015 THEN HE PULLED IT OUT AND PETER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A WORM DISAPPEARING DOWN LONGBILL'S THROAT WHERE THAT LONG BILL HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND WAS A NEAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE
1743-142914-0016 FOR THE FIRST TIME PETER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MANY SUCH LITTLE ROUND HOLES ALL ABOUT DID YOU MAKE ALL THOSE LITTLE ROUND HOLES EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142914-0017 AND WAS THERE A WORM IN EVERY ONE ASKED PETER HIS EYES VERY WIDE WITH INTEREST LONGBILL NODDED
1743-142914-0018 PETER REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED WELCOME ROBIN LISTEN AND THEN SUDDENLY PLUNGE HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND AND PULL OUT A WORM BUT THE WORMS WELCOME ROBIN GOT WERE ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
1743-142914-0019 WHILE THESE WORMS WERE SO DEEP IN THE EARTH THAT PETER COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE
1743-142914-0020 AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR BILL DOWN THERE TO TAKE HIM IN ASKED PETER LONGBILL CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0021 LONGBILL SUDDENLY THRUST HIS BILL STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND TO PETER'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED THE END OF THE UPPER HALF WITHOUT OPENING THE REST OF HIS BILL AT ALL THAT'S THE WAY I GET THEM SAID HE
1743-142914-0022 I THINK THERE IS ONE RIGHT UNDER MY FEET NOW WATCH ME GET HIM LONGBILL BORED INTO THE GROUND UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AGAINST IT WHEN HE PULLED HIS BILL OUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A WORM OF COURSE EXPLAINED LONGBILL IT IS ONLY IN SOFT GROUND THAT I CAN DO THIS
1743-142914-0023 THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO FLY AWAY SOUTH AS SOON AS THE GROUND FREEZES AT ALL IT'S WONDERFUL SIGHED PETER I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE CAN FIND HIDDEN WORMS THAT WAY MY COUSIN JACK SNIPE CAN REPLIED LONGBILL PROMPTLY
1743-142914-0024 HE FEEDS THE SAME WAY I DO ONLY HE LIKES MARSHY MEADOWS INSTEAD OF BRUSHY SWAMPS PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM PETER NODDED I DO SAID HE NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ALTHOUGH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF HIM AS A RELATIVE OF YOURS BEFORE
1743-142914-0025 NOW I MUST BE RUNNING ALONG I'M EVER SO GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU AND I'M COMING OVER TO CALL AGAIN THE FIRST CHANCE I GET SO PETER SAID GOOD BY AND KEPT ON DOWN THE LAUGHING BROOK TO THE SMILING POOL RIGHT WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK ENTERED THE SMILING POOL
1743-142914-0026 THERE WAS A LITTLE PEBBLY BEACH RUNNING ALONG THE VERY EDGE OF THE WATER WAS A SLIM TRIM LITTLE BIRD WITH FAIRLY LONG LEGS A LONG SLENDER BILL BROWNISH GRAY BACK WITH BLACK SPOTS AND MARKINGS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT NEATLY SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1743-142914-0027 EVERY FEW STEPS HE WOULD STOP TO PICK UP SOMETHING THEN STAND FOR A SECOND BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AS IF HIS BODY WAS SO NICELY BALANCED ON HIS LEGS THAT IT TEETERED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A SEESAW
1743-142914-0028 IT WAS TEETER THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER AN OLD FRIEND OF PETER'S PETER GREETED HIM JOYOUSLY
1743-142914-0029 BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD TEETER CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT TEETER WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING DON'T MOVE PETER RABBIT DON'T MOVE HE CRIED WHY NOT DEMANDED PETER FOR HE COULD SEE NO DANGER AND COULD THINK OF NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T MOVE
1743-142914-0030 JUST THEN MISSUS TEETER CAME HURRYING UP AND SQUATTED DOWN IN THE SAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF PETER THANK GOODNESS EXCLAIMED TEETER STILL BOBBING AND BOWING IF YOU HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP PETER RABBIT YOU WOULD HAVE STEPPED RIGHT ON OUR EGGS YOU GAVE ME A DREADFUL START
1743-142914-0031 MISSUS TEETER STOOD UP AND STEPPED ASIDE THEN PETER SAW RIGHT IN A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE SAND WITH JUST A FEW BITS OF GRASS FOR A LINING FOUR WHITE EGGS WITH BIG DARK BLOTCHES ON THEM
1743-142914-0032 THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1743-142914-0033 IT SUDDENLY STRUCK PETER THAT IF HE HADN'T SEEN HER DO IT HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN SHE WAS THERE
1743-142914-0034 MY HE EXCLAIMED I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE STEPPED ON THOSE EGGS IF YOU HADN'T WARNED ME SAID HE I'M SO THANKFUL I DIDN'T I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DARE LAY THEM IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS
1743-142913-0000 WITH THIS JENNY WREN DISAPPEARED INSIDE HER HOUSE AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR PETER TO DO BUT ONCE MORE START FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH ON HIS WAY HE COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN OVER TO THE GREEN FOREST WHICH WAS JUST BEYOND THE OLD ORCHARD
1743-142913-0001 HE JUST HAD TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW OVER THERE HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN HE HEARD A PLAINTIVE VOICE CRYING PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE PETER CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0002 HE USUALLY IS ONE OF THE LAST OF THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY TO ARRIVE I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND HIM YET I WONDER WHAT HAS BROUGHT HIM UP SO EARLY
1743-142913-0003 IT DIDN'T TAKE PETER LONG TO FIND PEWEE HE JUST FOLLOWED THE SOUND OF THAT VOICE AND PRESENTLY SAW PEWEE FLY OUT AND MAKE THE SAME KIND OF A LITTLE CIRCLE AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MAKE WHEN THEY ARE HUNTING FLIES
1743-142913-0004 IT ENDED JUST WHERE IT HAD STARTED ON A DEAD TWIG OF A TREE IN A SHADY RATHER LONELY PART OF THE GREEN FOREST ALMOST AT ONCE HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS NAME IN A RATHER SAD PLAINTIVE TONE PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE
1743-142913-0005 BUT HE WASN'T SAD AS PETER WELL KNEW IT WAS HIS WAY OF EXPRESSING HOW HAPPY HE FELT HE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN HIS COUSIN CHEBEC BUT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE NOTCH IN THE END OF HIS TAIL
1743-142913-0006 THE UPPER HALF OF HIS BILL WAS BLACK BUT THE LOWER HALF WAS LIGHT PETER COULD SEE ON EACH WING TWO WHITISH BARS AND HE NOTICED THAT PEWEE'S WINGS WERE LONGER THAN HIS TAIL WHICH WASN'T THE CASE WITH CHEBEC
1743-142913-0007 BUT NO ONE COULD EVER MISTAKE PEWEE FOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE KEEPS REPEATING HIS OWN NAME OVER AND OVER AREN'T YOU HERE EARLY ASKED PETER PEWEE NODDED
1743-142913-0008 THAT IS SOMETHING I DON'T OFTEN DO IF YOU PLEASE PETER INQUIRED POLITELY WHY DO FOLKS CALL YOU WOOD PEWEE PEWEE CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0009 IT IS SO QUIET AND RESTFUL THAT I LOVE IT MISSUS PEWEE AND I ARE VERY RETIRING WE DO NOT LIKE TOO MANY NEAR NEIGHBORS YOU WON'T MIND IF I COME TO SEE YOU ONCE IN A WHILE WILL YOU ASKED PETER AS HE PREPARED TO START ON AGAIN FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
1743-142913-0010 COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE REPLIED PEWEE THE OFTENER THE BETTER BACK IN THE OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT OVER ALL HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY AND AS HE RECALLED HOW THEY WERE FOREVER CATCHING ALL SORTS OF FLYING INSECTS IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0011 THAT THEY MUST BE VERY USEFUL LITTLE PEOPLE IN HELPING OLD MOTHER NATURE TAKE CARE OF HER TREES AND OTHER GROWING THINGS WHICH INSECTS SO DEARLY LOVE TO DESTROY
1743-142913-0012 BUT MOST OF ALL PETER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUEER REQUEST OF CRESTY'S AND A DOZEN TIMES THAT DAY HE FOUND HIMSELF PEEPING UNDER OLD LOGS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A CAST OFF COAT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE
1743-142913-0013 IT WAS SUCH A FUNNY THING FOR CRESTY TO ASK FOR THAT PETER'S CURIOSITY WOULD ALLOW HIM NO PEACE AND THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS UP IN THE OLD ORCHARD BEFORE JOLLY MISTER SUN HAD KICKED HIS BEDCLOTHES OFF
1743-142913-0014 JENNY WREN WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD WHILE SHE FLITTED AND HOPPED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY IN THAT FUSSY WAY OF HERS GETTING HER BREAKFAST SHE TALKED JENNY COULDN'T KEEP HER TONGUE STILL IF SHE WANTED TO DID YOU FIND ANY OLD CLOTHES OF THE SNAKE FAMILY SHE DEMANDED
1743-142913-0015 THEN AS PETER SHOOK HIS HEAD HER TONGUE RAN ON WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO REPLY CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ALWAYS INSIST UPON HAVING A PIECE OF SNAKE SKIN IN THEIR NEST SAID SHE WHY THEY WANT IT GOODNESS KNOWS BUT
1743-142913-0016 PERHAPS THEY THINK IT WILL SCARE ROBBERS AWAY AS FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE A COLD CHILL EVERY TIME I GOT INTO MY NEST IF I HAD TO SIT ON ANYTHING LIKE THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ARE A HANDSOME COUPLE
1743-142913-0017 AND THEY CERTAINLY HAVE GOOD SENSE IN CHOOSING A HOUSE MORE SENSE THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY TO MY WAY OF THINKING BUT SNAKE SKINS UGH BY THE WAY WHERE DOES CRESTY BUILD ASKED PETER
1743-142913-0018 IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
1743-142913-0019 WHERE ARE YOUR EYES PETER DID YOU EVER SEE A FLYCATCHER WITH A BILL THAT LOOKED AS IF IT COULD CUT WOOD SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR A REPLY BUT RATTLED ON IT IS A GOOD THING FOR A LOT OF US THAT THE WOODPECKER FAMILY ARE SO FOND OF NEW HOUSES LOOK
1743-142913-0020 THERE IS DOWNY THE WOODPECKER HARD AT WORK ON A NEW HOUSE THIS VERY MINUTE THAT'S GOOD I LIKE TO SEE THAT IT MEANS THAT NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE ONE MORE HOUSE FOR SOME ONE HERE IN THE OLD ORCHARD FOR MYSELF I PREFER OLD HOUSES
1743-142913-0021 I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MY NEIGHBORS WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT THERE IS SOMETHING SETTLED ABOUT AN OLD HOUSE IT DOESN'T ATTRACT ATTENTION THE WAY A NEW ONE DOES SO LONG AS IT HAS GOT REASONABLY GOOD WALLS AND THE RAIN AND THE WIND CAN'T GET IN
1743-142913-0022 THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
1743-142913-0023 WINSOME BLUEBIRD STUPID SNAPPED JENNY WREN PETER GRINNED AND LOOKED FOOLISH OF COURSE SAID HE I FORGOT ALL ABOUT WINSOME AND SKIMMER THE TREE SWALLOW ADDED JENNY THAT'S SO I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED HIM EXCLAIMED PETER

1743-142913-0025 TOMMY TIT THE CHICKADEE SOMETIMES USES AN OLD HOUSE THEN AGAIN HE AND MISSUS CHICKADEE GET FUSSY AND MAKE A HOUSE FOR THEMSELVES YELLOW WING THE FLICKER WHO REALLY IS A WOODPECKER OFTEN USES AN OLD HOUSE BUT QUITE OFTEN MAKES A NEW ONE
1743-142913-0026 THEN THERE ARE KILLY THE SPARROW HAWK AND SPOOKY THE SCREECH OWL PETER LOOKED SURPRISED I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THEY NESTED IN HOLES IN TREES HE EXCLAIMED THEY CERTAINLY DO MORE'S THE PITY SNAPPED JENNY

1743-142913-0028 SPOOKY ISN'T PARTICULAR SO LONG AS THE HOUSE IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE HE LIVES IN IT MORE OR LESS THE YEAR AROUND NOW I MUST GET BACK TO THOSE EGGS OF MINE I'VE TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE MORNING OH JENNY CRIED PETER AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HIM

3983-5371-0000 NOW MISS CORNY IN SO SPEAKING HAD CERTAINLY NO THOUGHT OF PRESENT AND IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT FOR THE GENTLEMAN BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE MOB AROUND HAD THE MOTION WAS COMMENTED BY THOSE STOUT SHOULDERED LABORERS
3983-5371-0001 OR WHETHER THEIR OWN FEELINGS ALONE SPURRED THEM ON WAS BEST KNOWN TO THE MEN THEMSELVES CERTAIN IT IS THAT THE OMINOUS SOUND OF DUCK HIM WAS BREATHED FORTH BY A VOICE AND IT WAS CAUGHT UP AND ECHOED AROUND DUCK HIM

3983-5371-0030 YOU MAY WONDER THAT THE SUBMERGED GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS WAY TO HIS QUARTERS THE RAVEN INN FOR HE HAD BEEN EJECTED FROM THE BUCK'S HEAD BUT HE COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF AS HE WAS DRIPPING AND SWEARING ON THE BRINK OF THE POND
3983-5371-0031 WONDERING HOW HE SHOULD GET TO THE RAVEN AN EMPTY FLY DROVE PAST AND MISTER DRAKE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED IT BUT WHEN THE DRIVER SAW THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO CONVEY NOT ONLY A PASSENGER BUT A TOLERABLE QUANTITY OF WATER AS WELL AND THAT THE PASSENGER MOREOVER WAS SIR FRANCIS LEVISON

3983-5371-0045 AND I CAN TELL YOU JOYCE THAT I WAS CONFOUNDED AT THE LIKENESS IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY LIKENESS
3983-5371-0046 THAT EVENING AFTER DINNER MISS CARLYLE AND LORD MOUNT SEVERN SAT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SAME SOFA COFFEE CUPS IN HAND MISS CARLYLE TURNED TO THE EARL WAS IT A POSITIVELY ASCERTAINED FACT THAT LADY ISABEL DIED THE EARL STARED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
3983-5371-0047 HE THOUGHT IT THE STRANGEST QUESTION THAT EVER WAS ASKED HIM I SCARCELY UNDERSTAND YOU MISS CARLYLE DIED CERTAINLY SHE DIED WHEN THE RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT WAS COMMUNICATED TO YOU YOU MADE INQUIRY YOURSELF INTO ITS TRUTH ITS DETAILS I BELIEVE
3983-5371-0048 IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO SO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO UNDERTAKE IT DID YOU ASCERTAIN POSITIVELY BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT SHE DID DIE
3983-5371-0049 A PAUSE MISS CARLYLE WAS RUMINATING BUT SHE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AS IF DIFFICULT TO BE CONVINCED YOU DEEM THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF AN ERROR YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD
3983-5371-0050 I AM AS SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD AS THAT WE ARE LIVING DECISIVELY REPLIED THE EARL AND HE SPOKE BUT ACCORDING TO HIS BELIEF WHEREFORE SHOULD YOU BE INQUIRING THIS A THOUGHT CAME OVER ME ONLY TO DAY TO WONDER WHETHER SHE WAS REALLY DEAD
3983-5371-0051 HAD ANY ERROR OCCURRED AT THAT TIME ANY FALSE REPORT OF HER DEATH I SHOULD SOON HAVE FOUND IT OUT BY HER DRAWING THE ANNUITY I SETTLED UPON HER IT HAS NEVER BEEN DRAWN SINCE BESIDES SHE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO ME AS AGREED UPON
3983-5371-0052 NO POOR THING SHE IS GONE BEYOND ALL DOUBT AND HAS TAKEN HER SINS WITH HER CONVINCING PROOFS AND MISS CARLYLE LENT HER EAR TO THEM THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHILE MADAME VINE WAS AT BREAKFAST MISTER CARLYLE ENTERED
3983-5371-0053 DO YOU ADMIT INTRUDERS HERE MADAME VINE CRIED HE WITH HIS SWEET SMILE AND ATTRACTIVE MANNER SHE AROSE HER FACE BURNING HER HEART THROBBING KEEP YOUR SEAT PRAY I HAVE BUT A MOMENT TO STAY SAID MISTER CARLYLE

3983-5371-0055 THE DRIVE I THINK WILL DO HIM GOOD REPLIED MISTER CARLYLE AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ACCOMPANY HIM IF YOU DO NOT MIND THE TROUBLE YOU CAN HAVE THE PONY CARRIAGE
3983-5371-0056 YOU CAN REMIND DOCTOR MARTIN THAT THE CHILD'S CONSTITUTION IS PRECISELY WHAT HIS MOTHER'S WAS CONTINUED MISTER CARLYLE A TINGE LIGHTENING HIS FACE IT MAY BE A GUIDE TO HIS TREATMENT HE SAID HIMSELF IT WAS WHEN HE ATTENDED HIM FOR AN ILLNESS A YEAR OR TWO AGO
3983-5371-0057 YES SIR HE CROSSED THE HALL ON HIS ENTRANCE TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE TORE UPSTAIRS TO HER CHAMBER AND SANK DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TEARS AND DESPAIR OH TO LOVE HIM AS SHE DID NOW TO YEARN AFTER HIS AFFECTION WITH THIS PASSIONATE JEALOUS LONGING
3983-5371-0058 AND TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR EVER AND EVER THAT SHE WAS WORSE TO HIM THAN NOTHING
83-3054-0000 A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
83-3054-0001 I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
83-3054-0002 I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
83-3054-0003 CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
83-3054-0004 ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
83-3054-0005 FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
83-3054-0006 THE PERIWINKLE IS A KIND OF SHRUB IT GROWS AT THE FOOT OF THE OYSTER TREE AND TWINES ROUND IT AS THE IVY DOES THE OAK
83-3054-0007 AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
83-3054-0008 AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
83-3054-0009 I ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ONE WITH ME BUT IT WAS TOO CUMBERSOME AND MY SALT WATER PEGASUS SEEMED MUCH DISPLEASED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP HIS CAREER WHILST I CONTINUED UPON HIS BACK
83-3054-0010 BESIDES I WAS THEN THOUGH GALLOPING OVER A MOUNTAIN OF ROCKS THAT LAY ABOUT MIDWAY THE PASSAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FATHOM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEGAN TO FIND THE WANT OF AIR INCONVENIENT
83-3054-0011 THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
83-3054-0012 NOT ONLY ABLE BUT REALLY WISHED TO DEVOUR US NOW AS MY ROSINANTE WAS BLIND I HAD THESE HUNGRY GENTLEMEN'S ATTEMPTS TO GUARD AGAINST IN ADDITION TO MY OTHER DIFFICULTIES
83-3054-0013 AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
83-3054-0014 WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
83-3054-0015 OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
83-3054-0016 FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
83-3054-0017 AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
83-3054-0018 AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
83-3054-0019 HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
83-9960-0000 THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
83-9960-0001 THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
83-9960-0002 ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
83-9960-0003 AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
83-9960-0004 THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
83-9960-0005 THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
83-9960-0006 THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
83-9960-0007 MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME BACK HERE TO TELL US IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL BE DONE TO HER
83-9960-0008 AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
83-9960-0009 THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
83-9960-0010 I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND I WARN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER RESUMED
83-9960-0011 AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
83-9960-0012 WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
83-9960-0013 WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
83-9960-0014 IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
83-9960-0015 MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
83-9960-0016 IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
83-9960-0017 HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
83-9960-0018 FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
83-9960-0019 SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
83-9960-0020 YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
83-9960-0021 AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
83-9960-0022 IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
83-9960-0023 AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
83-9960-0024 WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
83-9960-0025 FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
83-9960-0026 FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
83-9960-0027 WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
83-9960-0028 THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
83-9960-0029 AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
83-9960-0030 STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
83-9960-0031 WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
83-9960-0032 ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
83-9960-0033 THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES
83-9960-0034 TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN THIS CAN BE SCREWED TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
83-9960-0035 IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
83-9960-0036 HE POSSESSES LIBERTY IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF THIS SORT
83-9960-0037 THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
83-9960-0038 AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
83-9960-0039 THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
83-9960-0040 AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
83-9960-0041 THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
83-9960-0042 THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
83-9960-0043 SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
83-9960-0044 READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
83-9960-0045 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
83-9960-0046 OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
83-9960-0047 THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
83-9960-0048 MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
83-9960-0049 THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF PAPER
83-9960-0050 SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
83-9960-0051 SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
83-9960-0052 THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING THE DEVIL HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR
83-9960-0053 ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
83-9960-0054 REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
83-9960-0055 THENARDIER EXCLAIMED ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW
83-9960-0056 WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
7264-92314-0000 I SAY THAT THE FEW NEWSPAPER CONTROLLERS GOVERN AND GOVERN ABOMINABLY I AM RIGHT BUT THEY ONLY DO SO AS DO ALL NEW POWERS BY AT ONCE ALLIANCE WITH AND TREASON AGAINST THE OLD WITNESS HARMSWORTH AND THE POLITICIANS
7264-92314-0001 THIS CONNECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CERTAIN CHARACTER WHICH CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED BY THE TERM OFFICIAL UNDER CERTAIN FORMS OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE MINISTERS ONCE MADE USE OF PICKED
7264-92314-0002 AND RARE NEWSPAPERS TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND THESE NEWSPAPERS CAME TO BE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IT WAS A CRUDE METHOD AND HAS BEEN LONG ABANDONED EVEN BY THE SIMPLER DESPOTIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT NOTHING OF THAT KIND EXISTS NOW OF COURSE IN THE DEEPER CORRUPTION OF MODERN EUROPE
7264-92314-0003 LEAST OF ALL IN ENGLAND WHAT HAS GROWN UP HERE IS A PRESS ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT AND FAVOUR TO THE SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONAL POLITICS WHICH COLOURS THE WHOLE OF OUR GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS TO DAY IN ENGLAND THIS GIVES THEM SO DISTINCT A CHARACTER OF PARLIAMENTARY FALSEHOOD
7264-92314-0004 AND THAT FALSEHOOD IS SO CLEARLY DICTATED BY THEIR CONNECTION WITH EXECUTIVE POWER THAT THEY MERIT THE TITLE OFFICIAL THE REGIME UNDER WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING IS THAT OF A PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS GRADUALLY REPLACED THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC TRADITION OF ENGLAND
7264-92314-0005 THIS PLUTOCRACY A FEW WEALTHY INTERESTS IN PART CONTROLS IN PART IS EXPRESSED BY IS IN PART IDENTICAL WITH THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND IT HAS IN THE EXISTING CAPITALIST PRESS AN ALLY SIMILAR TO THAT OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92314-0006 WHICH CONTINENTAL NATIONS KNEW IN THE PAST BUT THERE IS THIS GREAT DIFFERENCE THAT THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CONTINENTAL EXPERIMENTS NEVER CONSISTED IN MORE THAN A FEW CHOSEN ORGANS
7264-92314-0007 THE CHARACTER OF WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN AND THE ATTITUDE OF WHICH CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE REST BUT OUR OFFICIAL PRESS FOR IT IS NO LESS COVERS THE WHOLE FIELD IT HAS IN THE REGION OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPERS NO COMPETITOR INDEED IT HAS NO COMPETITORS AT ALL
7264-92314-0008 IF ANY ONE DOUBTS THAT THIS ADJECTIVE OFFICIAL CAN PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO OUR CAPITALIST PRESS TO DAY LET HIM ASK HIMSELF FIRST WHAT THE FORCES ARE WHICH GOVERN THE NATION AND NEXT WHETHER THOSE FORCES THAT GOVERNMENT OR REGIME
7264-92314-0009 COULD BE BETTER SERVED EVEN UNDER A SYSTEM OF PERMANENT CENSORSHIP THAN IT IS IN THE GREAT DAILIES OF LONDON AND THE PRINCIPAL PROVINCIAL CAPITALS IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH THE REGIME DESIRES TO BE SUPPRESSED SUPPRESSED IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH IT DESIRES SUGGESTED SUGGESTED
7264-92314-0010 AND IS THERE ANY PUBLIC QUESTION WHICH WOULD WEAKEN THE REGIME AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS EVER ALLOWED TO APPEAR IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST JOURNALS THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUCH A CASE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS
7264-92314-0011 NEVER DEALS WITH MATTERS VITAL TO ITS PRESTIGE ON THE CONTRARY IT DELIBERATELY SIDE TRACKS ANY VITAL DISCUSSION THAT SINCERE CONVICTION MAY HAVE FORCED UPON THE PUBLIC AND SPOILS THE SCENT WITH FALSE ISSUES
7264-92314-0012 ONE PAPER NOT A LITTLE WHILE AGO WAS CLAMOURING AGAINST THE EXCESS OF LAWYERS IN GOVERNMENT ITS REMEDY WAS AN OPPOSITION TO BE HEADED BY A LAWYER ANOTHER WAS VERY SERIOUS UPON SECRET TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
7264-92314-0013 IT SUPPRESSED FOR MONTHS ALL REFERENCE TO THE ASTOUNDING INSTANCE OF THAT MISDEMEANOUR BY THE CONNECTIONS OF A VERY PROMINENT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN EARLY IN THE WAR AND REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE SINGLE REFERENCE MADE TO THIS CRIME IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
7264-92314-0014 ANOTHER CLAMOURS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ENEMY FINANCIAL POWER IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS COUNTRY AND YET SAYS NOT A WORD UPON THE AUDITING OF THE SECRET PARTY FUNDS
7264-92314-0015 I SAY THAT THE BIG DAILY PAPERS HAVE NOW NOT ONLY THOSE OTHER QUALITIES DANGEROUS TO THE STATE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED BUT THAT THEY HAVE BECOME ESSENTIALLY OFFICIAL THAT IS INSINCERE AND CORRUPT IN THEIR INTERESTED SUPPORT OF THAT PLUTOCRATIC COMPLEX WHICH IN THE DECAY OF ARISTOCRACY GOVERNS ENGLAND
7264-92314-0016 THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WHERE POWER IS CONCERNED THEY DO NOT REALLY CRITICIZE THEY SERVE A CLIQUE WHOM THEY SHOULD EXPOSE AND DENOUNCE AND BETRAY THE GENERALITY THAT IS THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SALARIED PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE PERPETUALLY WATCHED WITH SUSPICION AND SHARPLY KEPT IN CONTROL
7264-92314-0017 THE RESULT IS THAT THE MASS OF ENGLISHMEN HAVE CEASED TO OBTAIN OR EVEN TO EXPECT INFORMATION UPON THE WAY THEY ARE GOVERNED THEY ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL A CERTAIN UNEASINESS THEY KNOW THAT THEIR OLD POWER OF OBSERVATION OVER PUBLIC SERVANTS HAS SLIPPED FROM THEM
7264-92314-0018 THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION
7264-92314-0019 THEY HAVE NOT ADVANCED NEARLY AS FAR AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNERS AND THEIR SYSTEM THEY ARE STILL FOR THE MOST PART DUPED
7264-92314-0020 IS A VERY GREAT EVIL IT WARPS AND DEPLETES PUBLIC INFORMATION IT PREVENTS THE JUST CRITICISM OF PUBLIC SERVANTS ABOVE ALL IT GIVES IMMENSE AND IRRESPONSIBLE POWER TO A HANDFUL OF WEALTHY MEN
7264-92314-0021 AND ESPECIALLY TO THE ONE MOST WEALTHY AND UNSCRUPULOUS AMONG THEM WHOSE WEALTH IS AN ACCIDENT OF SPECULATION WHOSE ORIGINS ARE REPULSIVE AND WHOSE CHARACTERS HAVE AS A RULE THE WEAKNESS AND BASENESS DEVELOPED BY THIS SORT OF ADVENTURES
7264-92314-0022 THERE ARE AMONG SUCH GUTTER SNIPES THOUSANDS WHOSE LUCK ENDS IN THE NATIVE GUTTER HALF A DOZEN WHOSE LUCK LANDS THEM INTO MILLIONS ONE OR TWO AT MOST WHO ON THE TOP OF SUCH A CAREER GO CRAZY WITH THE AMBITION OF THE PARVENU AND PROPOSE TO DIRECT THE STATE
7264-92314-0023 EVEN WHEN GAMBLING ADVENTURERS OF THIS SORT ARE KNOWN AND RESPONSIBLE AS THEY ARE IN PROFESSIONAL POLITICS THEIR POWER IS A GRAVE DANGER POSSESSING AS THE NEWSPAPER OWNERS DO EVERY POWER OF CONCEALMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME
7264-92314-0024 NO SHRED OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY ORGAN OF THE STATE THEY ARE A DEADLY PERIL THE CHIEF OF THESE MEN ARE MORE POWERFUL TO DAY THAN ANY MINISTER NAY THEY DO AS I HAVE SAID AND IT IS NOW NOTORIOUS MAKE AND UNMAKE MINISTERS AND THEY MAY YET IN OUR WORST HOUR DECIDE THE NATIONAL FATE
7264-92314-0025 NOW TO EVERY HUMAN EVIL OF A POLITICAL SORT THAT HAS APPEARED IN HISTORY TO EVERY EVIL THAT IS AFFECTING THE STATE AND PROCEEDING FROM THE WILL OF MAN NOT FROM UNGOVERNABLE NATURAL FORCES OUTSIDE MAN THERE COMES A TERM AND A REACTION
7264-92314-0026 SIDE BY SIDE WITH WHAT I HAVE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IN OUR TOP HEAVY PLUTOCRACY THERE HAS ARISEN A CERTAIN FORCE FOR WHICH I HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A NAME BUT WHICH I WILL CALL FOR LACK OF A BETTER NAME THE FREE PRESS I MIGHT CALL IT THE INDEPENDENT PRESS
7264-92314-0027 WERE IT NOT THAT SUCH A WORD WOULD CONNOTE AS YET A LITTLE TOO MUCH POWER THOUGH I DO BELIEVE ITS POWER TO BE RISING AND THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE CHANGE OUR AFFAIRS
7264-92314-0028 I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OTHER MODERN LANGUAGE THAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUT I READ THIS FREE PRESS FRENCH AND ENGLISH COLONIAL AND AMERICAN REGULARLY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE CHIEF INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME
7264-92314-0029 IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND AND FOR ALL I KNOW ELSEWHERE THERE HAS ARISEN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE COMPLETE CORRUPTION AND FALSEHOOD OF THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CROP OF NEW ORGANS WHICH ARE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD ORGANS OF OPINION
7264-92314-0030 THE NEW AGE WAS I THINK THE PIONEER IN THE MATTER
7264-92314-0031 SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO THEIR NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS I PASS FROM THE JUST DENUNCIATION OF EVIL TO THE EXPOSITION OF WHAT IS GOOD
7264-92316-0000 THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA WHICH BEGAN TO WORK MUCH THE EARLIEST OF THE THREE CONCERNED RELIGIONS AND ALSO CERTAIN RACIAL ENTHUSIASMS OR POLITICAL DOCTRINES WHICH BY THEIR SINCERITY AND READINESS FOR SACRIFICE HAD HALF THE FORCE OF RELIGIONS
7264-92316-0001 MEN FOUND THAT THE GREAT PAPERS IN THEIR FINAL PHASE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT IN RELIGION THEY DARED DO NOTHING BUT REPEAT VERY DISCREETLY THE VAGUEST ETHICAL PLATITUDES THEY HARDLY DARED DO EVEN THAT THEY TOOK FOR GRANTED A SORT OF INVERTEBRATE COMMON OPINION
7264-92316-0002 AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT GREAT BODIES OF MEN WHO CARED INTENSELY FOR A DEFINITE CREED FOUND THAT EXPRESSION FOR IT WAS LACKING
7264-92316-0003 THE ORGANS OF OPINION PROFESSED A GENTEEL IGNORANCE OF THAT IDEA WHICH WAS MOST WIDESPREAD MOST INTENSE AND MOST FORMATIVE
7264-92316-0004 THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH A LARGE DAILY PAPER OWNED BY A JEW FROM ONE OWNED BY AN AGNOSTIC OR A CATHOLIC NECESSITY OF EXPRESSION COMPELLED THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ONE MOTIVE OF RELIGION MEN CAME ACROSS VERY LITTLE OF THIS IN ENGLAND
7264-92316-0005 BECAUSE ENGLAND WAS FOR LONG VIRTUALLY HOMOGENEOUS IN RELIGION AND THAT RELIGION WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE FREE PRESS AROSE BUT SUCH A FREE PRESS IN DEFENCE OF RELIGION THE PIONEER OF ALL THE FREE PRESS AROSE IN IRELAND AND IN FRANCE AND ELSEWHERE
7264-92316-0006 BUT IT ASSERTED THE NECESSITY OF SPECIALLY EMPHASIZING ITS PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW IN ITS OWN COLUMNS FOR RELIGION AFFECTS ALL LIFE
7264-92316-0007 A GENERATION AGO AND MORE GREAT NUMBERS OF MEN WERE PERSUADED THAT A SOLUTION FOR THE WHOLE COMPLEX OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE WAS TO BE FOUND IN WHAT THEY CALLED NATIONALIZING THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE
7264-92316-0008 THAT IS OF COURSE IN PLAIN ENGLISH PUTTING LAND HOUSES AND MACHINERY AND STORES OF FOOD AND CLOTHING INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLITICIANS FOR CONTROL IN USE AND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CONSUMPTION
7264-92316-0009 THIS CREED WAS HELD WITH PASSIONATE CONVICTION BY MEN OF THE HIGHEST ABILITY IN EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE AND A SOCIALIST PRESS BEGAN TO ARISE WHICH WAS EVERYWHERE FREE AND SOON IN ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92316-0010 AGAIN OF A RELIGIOUS TEMPER IN THEIR SEGREGATION CONVICTION AND ENTHUSIASM THERE BEGAN TO APPEAR WHEN THE OPPRESSOR WAS MILD THE SMALL PAPERS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES
7264-92316-0011 RELIGION THEN AND COGNATE ENTHUSIASMS WERE THE FIRST BREEDERS OF THE FREE PRESS IT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS STAMPED THE WHOLE MOVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CHARACTER TO WHICH I SHALL LATER REFER WHEN I COME TO ITS DISABILITIES
7264-92316-0012 FELT NO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE DEBATS FOR INSTANCE HIS PARTICULAR CATHOLIC ENTHUSIASM RECOGNIZED ITSELF AS EXCEPTIONAL AND WAS CONTENT TO ACCEPT THE HUMBLE OR AT ANY RATE INFERIOR POSITION WHICH ADMITTED ECCENTRICITY CONNOTES LATER
7264-92316-0013 THESE FOUNDERS OF THE FREE PRESS SEEMED TO SAY WE MAY CONVERT THE MASS TO OUR VIEWS BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE ADMITTEDLY A CLIQUE AN EXCEPTIONAL BODY WITH THE PENALTIES ATTACHING TO SUCH
7264-92316-0014 THEY SAID THIS ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE LIFE OF FRANCE IS AT LEAST AS CATHOLIC AS THE LIFE OF GREAT BRITAIN IS PLUTOCRATIC OR THE LIFE OF SWITZERLAND DEMOCRATIC AND THEY SAID IT BECAUSE THEY AROSE AFTER THE CAPITALIST PRESS NEUTRAL IN RELIGION AS IN EVERY VITAL THING
7264-92316-0015 HAD CAPTURED THE WHOLE FIELD THE FIRST PROPAGANDISTS THEN DID NOT STAND UP TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS AS EQUALS THEY CREPT IN AS INFERIORS OR RATHER AS OPEN EX CENTRICS
7264-92316-0016 FOR VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THIRD EMPIRE FRANCE FALSELY PROCLAIMED THE REPRESENTATIVE QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO THE HONOUR OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE SOCIALIST FREE PRESS WAS THE FIRST TO STAND UP AS AN EQUAL AGAINST THE GIANTS
7264-92316-0017 TO PAPERS LIKE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR THE TIMES WITH THE EPITHET CAPITALIST PUT AFTER THEM IN BRACKETS I THOUGHT THEN IT WAS THE GIVING OF AN ABNORMAL EPITHET TO A NORMAL THING
7264-92316-0018 BUT I NOW KNOW THAT THESE SMALL SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS WERE TALKING THE PLAINEST COMMON SENSE WHEN THEY SPECIFICALLY EMPHASIZED AS CAPITALIST THE FALSEHOODS AND SUPPRESSIONS OF THEIR GREAT CONTEMPORARIES
7264-92316-0019 FROM THE SOCIALIST POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT THE INSINCERITY OF THE GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS IS THAT THIS INSINCERITY IS CAPITALIST JUST AS FROM A CATHOLIC POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT IT WAS AND IS THAT IT IS ANTI CATHOLIC
7264-92316-0020 THOUGH HOWEVER CERTAIN OF THE SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS THUS BOLDLY TOOK UP A STANDPOINT OF MORAL EQUALITY WITH THE OTHERS THEIR ATTITUDE WAS EXCEPTIONAL
7264-92316-0021 THE GREAT DAILIES WERE THOUGHT GREY NOT WICKED ONLY GENERAL AND VAGUE THE FREE PRESS IN ITS BEGINNINGS DID NOT ATTACK AS AN ENEMY IT ONLY TIMIDLY CLAIMED TO BE HEARD IT REGARDED ITSELF AS A SPECIALITY IT WAS HUMBLE AND THERE WENT WITH IT A MASS OF EX CENTRIC STUFF
7264-92316-0022 IF ONE PASSES IN REVIEW ALL THE FREE PRESS JOURNALS WHICH OWED THEIR EXISTENCE IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE ALONE TO THIS MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA ONE FINDS MANY SIDE SHOWS AS IT WERE BESIDE THE MAIN MOTIVES OF LOCAL OR RACE PATRIOTISM RELIGION OR SOCIALIST CONVICTION
7264-92316-0023 YOU HAVE THE SINGLE TAX PAPERS YOU HAVE THE TEETOTAL PAPERS AND REALLY IT IS A WONDER THAT YOU HAVE NOT YET ALSO HAD THE ICONOCLASTS AND THE DIABOLISTS PRODUCING PAPERS THE RATIONALIST AND THE ATHEIST PROPAGANDA I RECKON AMONG THE RELIGIOUS
7264-92316-0024 WE MAY TAKE IT THEN THAT PROPAGANDA WAS IN ORDER OF TIME THE FIRST MOTIVE OF THE FREE PRESS AND THE FIRST CAUSE OF ITS PRODUCTION NOW FROM THIS FACT ARISES A CONSIDERATION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR SUBJECT
7264-92316-0025 I MEAN THAT THE FREE PRESS HAS HAD STAMPED UPON IT THE CHARACTER OF DISPARATE PARTICULARISM
7264-92316-0026 BUT I KNOW THAT WHEREVER I GET HOLD OF SUCH AN ORGAN IT WILL BE VERY STRONGLY COLOURED WITH THE OPINION OR EVEN FANATICISM OF SOME MINORITY THE FREE PRESS AS A WHOLE
7264-92316-0027 IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND CANCEL OUT ONE EXAGGERATED STATEMENT AGAINST ANOTHER DOES GIVE YOU A TRUE VIEW OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO DAY GIVES YOU AN ABSURDLY FALSE ONE EVERYWHERE
7264-92316-0028 NO ONE OF THEM IS IN ANY SENSE GENERAL OR REALLY NATIONAL THE FREE PRESS GIVES YOU THE TRUTH BUT ONLY IN DISJOINTED SECTIONS FOR IT IS DISPARATE AND IT IS PARTICULARIST IT IS MARKED WITH ISOLATION AND IT IS SO MARKED BECAUSE ITS ORIGIN LAY IN VARIOUS AND MOST DIVERSE PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0029 BECAUSE IT CAME LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CAPITALISM AND WAS IN ITS ORIGINS BUT A REACTION AGAINST IT B THE SECOND MOTIVE THAT OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD CAME TO WORK MUCH LATER THAN THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0030 MEN GRADUALLY CAME TO NOTICE THAT ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER OF GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST SOMETIMES OF VITAL PUBLIC INTEREST WAS DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED IN THE PRINCIPAL GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS AND THAT POSITIVE FALSEHOODS WERE INCREASINGLY SUGGESTED OR STATED
7264-92316-0031 THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS FOR LONG THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONTENT TO REGARD IT AS A REVENUE PRODUCING THING THE EDITOR WAS SUPREME IN MATTERS OF CULTURE AND OPINION TRUE THE EDITOR BEING REVOCABLE AND POOR COULD NOT PRETEND TO FULL POLITICAL POWER
7264-92316-0032 BUT IT WAS A SORT OF DUAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH YET MODIFIED THE POWER OF THE VULGAR OWNER I MYSELF REMEMBER THAT STATE OF AFFAIRS THE EDITOR WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN AND DINED OUT THE PROPRIETOR WHO WAS A LORD AND NERVOUS WHEN HE MET A GENTLEMAN
7264-92316-0033 THE EDITOR BECAME AND NOW IS A MERE MOUTHPIECE OF THE PROPRIETOR EDITORS SUCCEED EACH OTHER RAPIDLY OF GREAT PAPERS TO DAY THE EDITOR'S NAME OF THE MOMENT IS HARDLY KNOWN
7264-92316-0034 BUT NOT A CABINET MINISTER THAT COULD NOT PASS AN EXAMINATION IN THE LIFE VICES VULNERABILITY FORTUNE INVESTMENTS AND FAVOURS OF THE OWNER THE CHANGE WAS RAPIDLY ADMITTED IT CAME QUICKLY BUT THOROUGHLY AT LAST LIKE MOST RAPID DEVELOPMENTS IT EXCEEDED ITSELF
7264-92316-0035 MEN OWNING THE CHIEF NEWSPAPERS COULD BE HEARD BOASTING OF THEIR POWER IN PUBLIC AS AN ADMITTED THING AND AS THIS POWER WAS RECOGNIZED AND AS IT GREW WITH TIME AND EXPERIMENT IT BRED A REACTION
7264-92316-0036 WHY SHOULD THIS OR THAT VULGARIAN MEN BEGAN TO SAY EXERCISE AND BOAST OF THE POWER TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IGNORANT UPON MATTERS VITAL TO US ALL TO DISTORT
7264-92316-0037 TO LIE THE SHEER NECESSITY OF GETTING CERTAIN TRUTHS TOLD WHICH THESE POWERFUL BUT HIDDEN FELLOWS REFUSED TO TELL WAS A FORCE WORKING AT HIGH POTENTIAL AND ALMOST COMPELLING THE PRODUCTION OF FREE PAPERS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BIG OFFICIAL ONES
7264-92316-0038 THAT IS WHY YOU NEARLY ALWAYS FIND THE FREE PRESS DIRECTED BY MEN OF INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION OF EXCEPTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION AND THAT IS WHERE IT CONTRASTS MOST WITH ITS OPPONENTS C
7264-92316-0039 BUT ONLY A LITTLE LATER THAN THIS SECOND MOTIVE OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD AND ACTING WITH EQUAL FORCE THOUGH UPON FEWER MEN WAS THE THIRD MOTIVE OF FREEDOM OF INDIGNATION AGAINST ARBITRARY POWER
7264-92316-0040 BUT IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT SIMILAR POWER SHOULD RESIDE IN THE HANDS OF OBSCURE NOBODIES ABOUT WHOM NO ILLUSION COULD POSSIBLY EXIST WHOSE TYRANNY IS NOT ADMITTED OR PUBLIC AT ALL WHO DO NOT EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF EXPOSING THEIR FEATURES AND TO WHOM NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER ATTACHES
7264-92316-0041 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS SO PROVIDED THE THIRD AND PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL MOTIVE FOR THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS
7264-92316-0042 UNFORTUNATELY IT COULD AFFECT ONLY VERY FEW MEN WITH THE MASS EVEN OF WELL EDUCATED AND OBSERVANT MEN THE FEELING CREATED BY THE NOVEL POWER OF THE GREAT PAPERS WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A VAGUE ILL EASE
7264-92316-0043 THEY HAD A GENERAL CONCEPTION THAT THE OWNER OF A WIDELY CIRCULATED POPULAR NEWSPAPER COULD AND DID BLACKMAIL THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN MAKE OR UNMAKE THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN BY GRANTING OR REFUSING HIM THE LIMELIGHT
7264-92316-0044 DISPOSE OF CABINETS NOMINATE ABSURD MINISTERS BUT THE PARTICULAR VIVID CONCRETE INSTANCES THAT SPECIALLY MOVE MEN TO ACTION WERE HIDDEN FROM THEM ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH PARTICULAR TRUTHS
7264-92316-0045 BUT THAT SMALL NUMBER KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE WERE THUS IN REALITY GOVERNED BY MEN RESPONSIBLE TO NO ONE AND HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC BLAME

1737-148989-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN WAITING
1737-148989-0001 SAID PROFESSOR BHAER COMING IN ONE DAY EARLY IN JANUARY PLEASE TELL IT AT ONCE I CAN'T BEAR TO WAIT FRITZ CRIED MISSUS JO DROPPING HER WORK AND STANDING UP AS IF TO TAKE THE SHOT BRAVELY BUT WE MUST WAIT AND HOPE HEART'S DEAREST COME
1737-148989-0002 AND LET US BEAR IT TOGETHER EMIL'S SHIP IS LOST AND AS YET NO NEWS OF HIM IT WAS WELL MISTER BHAER HAD TAKEN HIS WIFE INTO HIS STRONG ARMS FOR SHE LOOKED READY TO DROP BUT BORE UP AFTER A MOMENT
1737-148989-0003 AND SITTING BY HER GOOD MAN HEARD ALL THAT THERE WAS TO TELL TIDINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE SHIPOWNERS AT HAMBURG BY SOME OF THE SURVIVORS AND TELEGRAPHED AT ONCE BY FRANZ TO HIS UNCLE AS ONE BOAT LOAD WAS SAFE
1737-148989-0004 THERE WAS HOPE THAT OTHERS MIGHT ALSO ESCAPE THOUGH THE GALE HAD SENT TWO TO THE BOTTOM A SWIFT SAILING STEAMER HAD BROUGHT THESE SCANTY NEWS AND HAPPIER ONES MIGHT COME AT ANY HOUR BUT KIND FRANZ HAD NOT ADDED THAT THE SAILORS REPORTED THE CAPTAIN'S BOAT AS UNDOUBTEDLY WRECKED BY THE FALLING MAST
1737-148989-0005 EVEN WHEN HOPE WAXED FAINT AND HER HEART WAS HEAVY IF ANYTHING COULD COMFORT THE BHAERS FOR THE LOSS OF ONE BOY
1737-148989-0006 FRANZ KEPT THE CABLE BUSY WITH HIS VARYING MESSAGES NAT SENT LOVING LETTERS FROM LEIPZIG AND TOM HARASSED THE SHIPPING AGENTS FOR NEWS EVEN BUSY JACK WROTE THEM WITH UNUSUAL WARMTH
1737-148989-0007 DOLLY AND GEORGE CAME OFTEN BEARING THE LOVELIEST FLOWERS AND THE DAINTIEST BON BONS TO CHEER MISSUS BHAER AND SWEETEN JOSIE'S GRIEF WHILE GOOD HEARTED NED TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM CHICAGO TO PRESS THEIR HANDS AND SAY WITH A TEAR IN HIS EYE
1737-148989-0008 I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO HEAR ALL ABOUT THE DEAR OLD BOY I COULDN'T KEEP AWAY THAT'S RIGHT COMFORTABLE AND SHOWS ME THAT IF I DIDN'T TEACH MY BOYS ANYTHING ELSE I DID GIVE THEM THE BROTHERLY LOVE THAT WILL MAKE THEM STAND BY ONE ANOTHER ALL THEIR LIVES SAID MISSUS JO WHEN HE HAD GONE
1737-148989-0009 HAD THEY ALL BEEN TRUE THE ELDERS BORE IT QUIETLY HAVING LEARNED SUBMISSION IN LIFE'S HARD SCHOOL BUT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE REBELLED SOME HOPED AGAINST HOPE AND KEPT UP OTHERS DESPAIRED AT ONCE AND LITTLE JOSIE EMIL'S PET COUSIN AND PLAYMATE WAS SO BROKEN HEARTED
1737-148989-0010 NOTHING COULD COMFORT HER NAN DOSED IN VAIN DAISY'S CHEERFUL WORDS WENT BY LIKE THE WIND AND BESS'S DEVICES TO AMUSE HER ALL FAILED UTTERLY TO CRY IN MOTHER'S ARMS AND TALK ABOUT THE WRECK WHICH HAUNTED HER EVEN IN HER SLEEP WAS ALL SHE CARED TO DO
1737-148989-0011 AND MISSUS MEG WAS GETTING ANXIOUS WHEN MISS CAMERON SENT JOSIE A KIND NOTE
1737-148989-0012 AND BE LIKE THE SELF SACRIFICING HEROINES SHE LOVED TO ACT
1737-148989-0013 FOR THE BOY WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUDDEN ECLIPSE OF THE FIREFLY WHOSE LIGHT AND LIFE ALL MISSED WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LURED HER OUT EVERY DAY FOR LONG DRIVES BEHIND THE BLACK MARE WHO SHOOK HER SILVERY BELLS TILL THEY MADE SUCH MERRY MUSIC JOSIE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING TO IT
1737-148989-0014 AND WHISKED HER OVER THE SNOWY ROADS AT A PACE WHICH SET THE BLOOD DANCING IN HER VEINS AND SENT HER HOME STRENGTHENED AND COMFORTED BY SUNSHINE FRESH AIR AND CONGENIAL SOCIETY THREE AIDS YOUNG SUFFERERS SELDOM CAN RESIST
1737-148989-0015 SOME REGRET FOR FAULTS THAT LIE HEAVY ON THE CONSCIENCE WHEN THE ONE SINNED AGAINST IS GONE AND ALL OF THEM THE SOLEMN LESSON TO BE READY WHEN THE SUMMONS COMES A HUSH LAY OVER PLUMFIELD FOR WEEKS AND THE STUDIOUS FACES ON THE HILL REFLECTED THE SADNESS OF THOSE IN THE VALLEY
1737-148989-0016 THEN UP WENT THE FLAG OUT RANG THE COLLEGE BELLS BANG WENT TEDDY'S LONG UNUSED CANNON AND A CHORUS OF HAPPY VOICES CRIED THANK GOD AS PEOPLE WENT ABOUT LAUGHING CRYING AND EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER IN A RAPTURE OF DELIGHT
1737-148989-0017 FOR MISSUS JO CARRIED THEM IN HER POCKET WHEN MISTER BHAER DID NOT HAVE THEM IN HIS AND BOTH TOOK A LOOK AT THEM WHEN THEY SAID THEIR PRAYERS AT NIGHT NOW THE PROFESSOR WAS HEARD HUMMING LIKE A BIG BEE AGAIN AS HE WENT TO HIS CLASSES
1737-148989-0018 AND LET HER ROMANCES WAIT NOW MESSAGES OF CONGRATULATION FLOWED IN AND BEAMING FACES SHOWED EVERYWHERE ROB AMAZED HIS PARENTS BY PRODUCING A POEM WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS YEARS AND DEMI SET IT TO MUSIC THAT IT MIGHT BE SUNG WHEN THE SAILOR BOY RETURNED
1737-148989-0019 TEDDY STOOD ON HIS HEAD LITERALLY AND TORE ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ON OCTOO LIKE A SECOND PAUL REVERE ONLY HIS TIDINGS WERE GOOD BUT BEST OF ALL LITTLE JOSIE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AS THE SNOWDROPS DID AND BEGAN TO BLOOM AGAIN GROWING TALL AND QUIET
1737-148989-0020 WITH THE SHADOW OF PAST SORROW TO TONE DOWN HER FORMER VIVACITY AND SHOW THAT SHE HAD LEARNED A LESSON IN TRYING TO ACT WELL HER PART ON THE REAL STAGE WHERE ALL HAVE TO TAKE THEIR SHARE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE
1737-148989-0021 THERE WAS GREAT SCRUBBING AND DUSTING AMONG THE MATRONS AS THEY SET THEIR HOUSES IN ORDER NOT ONLY FOR CLASS DAY BUT TO RECEIVE THE BRIDE AND GROOM WHO WERE TO COME TO THEM FOR THE HONEYMOON TRIP GREAT PLANS WERE MADE GIFTS PREPARED AND MUCH JOY FELT AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING FRANZ AGAIN
1737-148989-0022 THOUGH EMIL WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THEM WOULD BE THE GREATER HERO LITTLE DID THE DEAR SOULS DREAM WHAT A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR THEM AS THEY INNOCENTLY LAID THEIR PLANS AND WISHED ALL THE BOYS COULD BE THERE TO WELCOME HOME THEIR ELDEST AND THEIR CASABLANCA
1737-148989-0023 WHILE THEY WAIT AND WORK SO HAPPILY LET US SEE HOW OUR OTHER ABSENT BOYS ARE FARING AS THEY TOO WAIT AND WORK AND HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS NAT WAS TOILING STEADILY ALONG THE PATH HE HAD WISELY CHOSEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS STREWN WITH FLOWERS
1737-148989-0024 QUITE THORNY WAS IT IN FACT AND HARD TO TRAVEL AFTER THE TASTE OF EASE AND PLEASURE HE HAD GOT WHEN NIBBLING AT FORBIDDEN FRUIT BUT HIS CROP OF WILD OATS WAS A LIGHT ONE AND HE RESOLUTELY REAPED WHAT HE HAD SOWED FINDING SOME GOOD WHEAT AMONG THE TARES HE TAUGHT BY DAY
1737-148989-0025 HE FIDDLED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN THE DINGY LITTLE THEATRE AND HE STUDIED SO DILIGENTLY THAT HIS MASTER WAS WELL PLEASED AND KEPT HIM IN MIND AS ONE TO WHOM PREFERMENT WAS DUE IF ANY CHANCE OCCURRED GAY FRIENDS FORGOT HIM BUT THE OLD ONES STOOD FAST
1737-148989-0026 AND CHEERED HIM UP WHEN HEIMWEH AND WEARINESS MADE HIM SAD AS SPRING CAME ON THINGS MENDED EXPENSES GREW LESS WORK PLEASANTER AND LIFE MORE BEARABLE THAN WHEN WINTRY STORMS BEAT ON HIS THINLY CLAD BACK
1737-148989-0027 AND FROST PINCHED THE TOES THAT PATIENTLY TRUDGED IN OLD BOOTS NO DEBTS BURDENED HIM THE YEAR OF ABSENCE WAS NEARLY OVER AND IF HE CHOSE TO STAY HERR BERGMANN HAD HOPES FOR HIM THAT WOULD BRING INDEPENDENCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST
1737-148989-0028 SO HE WALKED UNDER THE LINDENS WITH A LIGHTER HEART AND IN THE MAY EVENINGS WENT ABOUT THE CITY WITH A BAND OF STROLLING STUDENTS MAKING MUSIC BEFORE HOUSES WHERE HE USED TO SIT AS GUEST
1737-148989-0029 AND ONCE MINNA THREW HIM MONEY WHICH HE HUMBLY RECEIVED AS PART OF HIS PENANCE BEING MORBID ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS SINS HIS REWARD CAME SOONER THAN HE EXPECTED AND WAS GREATER THAN HE DESERVED HE THOUGHT THOUGH HIS HEART LEAPED WITH JOY WHEN HIS MASTER ONE DAY INFORMED HIM
1737-148989-0030 THAT HE WAS CHOSEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER OF HIS MOST PROMISING PUPILS TO JOIN THE MUSICAL SOCIETY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN LONDON THE NEXT JULY HERE WAS NOT ONLY HONOUR FOR THE VIOLINIST BUT HAPPINESS FOR THE MAN AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER HOME
1737-148989-0031 AS THE GREAT BERGMANN SELDOM PRAISED HIS PUPILS THESE WORDS FILLED NAT'S SOUL WITH PRIDE AND JOY AND HE WORKED YET MORE DILIGENTLY THAN BEFORE TO FULFIL HIS MASTER'S PROPHECY HE THOUGHT THE TRIP TO ENGLAND HAPPINESS ENOUGH BUT FOUND ROOM FOR MORE WHEN EARLY IN JUNE
1737-148989-0032 KIND WISHES AND COMFORTABLE GIFTS FOR THE LONELY FELLOW WHO COULD HAVE FALLEN ON THEIR NECKS AND CRIED LIKE A GIRL AT SEEING HIS OLD MATES AGAIN HOW GLAD HE WAS TO BE FOUND IN HIS LITTLE ROOM BUSY AT HIS PROPER WORK NOT LIVING LIKE AN IDLE GENTLEMAN ON BORROWED MONEY
1737-148989-0033 HOW PROUD HE WAS TO TELL HIS PLANS ASSURE THEM THAT HE HAD NO DEBTS AND RECEIVE THEIR PRAISES FOR HIS IMPROVEMENT IN MUSIC THEIR RESPECT FOR HIS ECONOMY AND STEADFASTNESS IN WELL DOING
1737-148989-0034 HOW RELIEVED WHEN HAVING HONESTLY CONFESSED HIS SHORTCOMINGS THEY ONLY LAUGHED AND OWNED THAT THEY ALSO HAD KNOWN LIKE EXPERIENCES AND WERE THE WISER FOR THEM HE WAS TO GO TO THE WEDDING LATE IN JUNE AND JOIN HIS COMRADES IN LONDON
1737-148989-0035 AS BEST MAN HE COULD NOT REFUSE THE NEW SUIT FRANZ INSISTED ON ORDERING FOR HIM AND A CHEQUE FROM HOME ABOUT THAT TIME MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AND A HAPPY ONE FOR THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH KIND LETTERS FULL OF DELIGHT IN HIS SUCCESS
1737-148989-0036 HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
1737-148989-0037 THANKS TO THE FAITHFUL FRIEND WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM ALL THAT BITTER YEAR SOON HE WAS TO BE FREE AGAIN WORN AND SCARRED IN THE FRAY
1737-148989-0038 WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT DAN FELT AS IF HE COULD NOT WAIT BUT MUST BURST THAT NARROW CELL AND FLY AWAY AS THE CADDIS WORMS HE USED TO WATCH BY THE BROOKSIDE SHED THEIR STONY COFFINS TO CLIMB THE FERNS AND SOAR INTO THE SKY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE LULLED HIMSELF TO SLEEP WITH PLANNING HOW
1737-148989-0039 AND THE OLD FREE LIFE WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE FROM THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BESET HIM IN CITIES BY AND BY WHEN I'M ALL RIGHT AGAIN AND HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THAT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF I'LL GO HOME HE SAID WITH A QUICKER BEAT OF THE IMPETUOUS HEART THAT LONGED TO BE THERE SO INTENSELY
1737-148989-0040 AS HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT HAD DONE SINCE A CERTAIN LITTLE WHITE HAND HAD LAID IN IT CONFIDINGLY I'LL MAKE EM PROUD OF ME YET AND NO ONE SHALL EVER KNOW OF THIS AWFUL YEAR I CAN WIPE IT OUT AND I WILL SO HELP ME GOD
1737-142397-0000 THE MASTERFUL WIND WAS UP AND OUT SHOUTING AND CHASING THE LORD OF THE MORNING POPLARS SWAYED AND TOSSED WITH A ROARING SWISH DEAD LEAVES SPRANG ALOFT AND WHIRLED INTO SPACE AND ALL THE CLEAR SWEPT HEAVEN SEEMED TO THRILL WITH SOUND LIKE A GREAT HARP
1737-142397-0001 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AWAKENINGS OF THE YEAR THE EARTH STRETCHED HERSELF SMILING IN HER SLEEP AND EVERYTHING LEAPT AND PULSED TO THE STIR OF THE GIANT'S MOVEMENT WITH US IT WAS A WHOLE HOLIDAY THE OCCASION A BIRTHDAY IT MATTERS NOT WHOSE
1737-142397-0002 SOME ONE OF US HAD HAD PRESENTS AND PRETTY CONVENTIONAL SPEECHES AND HAD GLOWED WITH THAT SENSE OF HEROISM WHICH IS NO LESS SWEET THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO DESERVE IT BUT THE HOLIDAY WAS FOR ALL THE RAPTURE OF AWAKENING NATURE FOR ALL
1737-142397-0003 THE VARIOUS OUTDOOR JOYS OF PUDDLES AND SUN AND HEDGE BREAKING FOR ALL COLT LIKE I RAN THROUGH THE MEADOWS FRISKING HAPPY HEELS IN THE FACE OF NATURE LAUGHING RESPONSIVE ABOVE THE SKY WAS BLUEST OF THE BLUE WIDE POOLS LEFT BY THE WINTER'S FLOODS
1737-142397-0004 FLASHED THE COLOUR BACK TRUE AND BRILLIANT AND THE SOFT AIR THRILLED WITH THE GERMINATING TOUCH THAT SEEMED TO KINDLE SOMETHING IN MY OWN SMALL PERSON AS WELL AS IN THE RASH PRIMROSE ALREADY LURKING IN SHELTERED HAUNTS OUT INTO THE BRIMMING SUN BATHED WORLD I SPED FREE OF LESSONS
1737-142397-0005 OH HE'S JUST PLAYIN MUFFIN MAN AS USUAL SAID CHARLOTTE WITH PETULANCE FANCY WANTING TO BE A MUFFIN MAN ON A WHOLE HOLIDAY IT WAS A STRANGE CRAZE CERTAINLY BUT HAROLD WHO INVENTED HIS OWN GAMES AND PLAYED THEM WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
1737-142397-0006 ALWAYS STUCK STAUNCHLY TO A NEW FAD TILL HE HAD WORN IT QUITE OUT JUST AT PRESENT HE WAS A MUFFIN MAN
1737-142397-0007 AND OFFERING PHANTOM MUFFINS TO INVISIBLE WAYFARERS
1737-142397-0008 TO PASS ALONG BUSY STREETS OF YOUR OWN BUILDING FOR EVER RINGING AN IMAGINARY BELL AND OFFERING AIRY MUFFINS OF YOUR OWN MAKE TO A BUSTLING THRONGING CROWD OF YOUR OWN CREATION THERE WERE POINTS ABOUT THE GAME IT CANNOT BE DENIED THOUGH IT SEEMED SCARCE IN HARMONY WITH THIS RADIANT WIND SWEPT MORNING
1737-142397-0009 ONLY YOU MUSTN'T SAY I TOLD YOU COS IT'S TO BE A SURPRISE ALL RIGHT I SAID MAGNANIMOUSLY
1737-142397-0010 BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT ON THIS DAY OF DAYS EVEN A GRIZZLY FELT MISPLACED AND COMMON SURE ENOUGH AN UNDENIABLE BEAR SPRANG OUT ON US AS WE DROPPED INTO THE ROAD THEN ENSUED SHRIEKS GROWLINGS REVOLVER SHOTS AND UNRECORDED HEROISMS
1737-142397-0011 AND THE AGE OF ACORNS HAVE DISPLACED OUR HARD WON CIVILISATION
1737-142397-0012 DO SHOUTED EDWARD VALIANTLY I SHOULD I SHOULD I SHOULD
1737-142397-0013 HE BEAT THE UNICORN OBSERVED HAROLD DUBIOUSLY ALL ROUND THE TOWN THAT PROVES HE WAS A GOOD LION CRIED EDWARDS TRIUMPHANTLY BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU TO TELL EM WHEN YOU SEE EM I SHOULD ASK MARTHA SAID HAROLD OF THE SIMPLE CREED
1737-142397-0014 AND I'LL RUN ON TO THAT CORNER AND BE A LION
1737-142397-0015 NO I WON'T I SWEAR I WON'T PROTESTED EDWARD I'LL BE QUITE A NEW LION THIS TIME SOMETHING YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE AND HE RACED OFF TO HIS POST CHARLOTTE HESITATED THEN SHE WENT TIMIDLY ON
1737-142397-0016 AT EACH STEP GROWING LESS CHARLOTTE THE MUMMER OF A MINUTE AND MORE THE ANXIOUS PILGRIM OF ALL TIME THE LION'S WRATH WAXED TERRIBLE AT HER APPROACH HIS ROARING FILLED THE STARTLED AIR
1737-142397-0017 INTO THE VACANT MEADOW SPACES
1737-142397-0018 BUT THE PASSION AND THE CALL OF THE DIVINE MORNING WERE HIGH IN MY BLOOD EARTH TO EARTH THAT WAS THE FRANK NOTE THE JOYOUS SUMMONS OF THE DAY AND THEY COULD NOT BUT JAR AND SEEM ARTIFICIAL THESE HUMAN DISCUSSIONS AND PRETENCES
1737-142397-0019 THE PANT AND SMOKE OF A DISTANT TRAIN ALL WERE WINE OR SONG WAS IT OR ODOUR THIS UNITY THEY ALL BLENDED INTO I HAD NO WORDS THEN TO DESCRIBE IT THAT EARTH EFFLUENCE OF WHICH I WAS SO CONSCIOUS NOR INDEED HAVE I FOUND WORDS SINCE
1737-142397-0020 I RAN SIDEWAYS SHOUTING I DUG GLAD HEELS INTO THE SQUELCHING SOIL I SPLASHED DIAMOND SHOWERS FROM PUDDLES WITH A STICK I HURLED CLODS SKYWARDS AT RANDOM AND PRESENTLY I SOMEHOW FOUND MYSELF SINGING
1737-142397-0021 A WEARY UNRHYTHMIC THING OF RISE AND FALL AND YET IT SEEMED TO ME A GENUINE UTTERANCE AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE ONE THING FITTING AND RIGHT AND PERFECT HUMANITY WOULD HAVE REJECTED IT WITH SCORN NATURE EVERYWHERE SINGING IN THE SAME KEY
1737-142397-0022 RECOGNISED AND ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISSENT ALL THE TIME THE HEARTY WIND WAS CALLING TO ME COMPANIONABLY FROM WHERE HE SWUNG AND BELLOWED IN THE TREE TOPS
1737-142397-0023 A BELATED TRUANT YOU HAVE DRAGGED A WEARY FOOT HOMEWARD WITH ONLY A PALE EXPRESSIONLESS MOON FOR COMPANY TO DAY WHY NOT I THE TRICKSTER THE HYPOCRITE I WHO WHIP ROUND CORNERS AND BLUSTER RELAPSE AND EVADE THEN RALLY AND PURSUE
1737-142397-0024 I CAN LEAD YOU THE BEST AND RAREST DANCE OF ANY FOR I AM THE STRONG CAPRICIOUS ONE THE LORD OF MISRULE AND I ALONE AM IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNPRINCIPLED AND OBEY NO LAW AND FOR ME I WAS READY ENOUGH TO FALL IN WITH THE FELLOW'S HUMOUR WAS NOT THIS A WHOLE HOLIDAY
1737-142397-0025 SO WE SHEERED OFF TOGETHER ARM IN ARM SO TO SPEAK AND WITH FULLEST CONFIDENCE I TOOK THE JIGGING THWARTWISE COURSE MY CHAINLESS PILOT LAID FOR ME A WHIMSICAL COMRADE I FOUND HIM ERE HE HAD DONE WITH ME
1737-142397-0026 SILENT FACE TO FACE O'ER A DISCREET UNWINKING STILE AS A RULE THIS SORT OF THING STRUCK ME AS THE MOST PITIFUL TOMFOOLERY TWO CALVES RUBBING NOSES THROUGH A GATE WERE NATURAL AND RIGHT AND WITHIN THE ORDER OF THINGS BUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS
1737-142397-0027 WITH SALIENT INTERESTS AND ACTIVE PURSUITS BECKONING THEM ON FROM EVERY SIDE COULD THUS
1737-142397-0028 AND IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT I FOUND MYSELF REGARDING THESE FATUOUS ONES WITH KINDLINESS INSTEAD OF CONTEMPT AS I RAMBLED BY UNHEEDED OF THEM THERE WAS INDEED SOME RECONCILING INFLUENCE ABROAD WHICH COULD BRING THE LIKE ANTICS INTO HARMONY WITH BUD AND GROWTH AND THE FROLIC AIR
1737-142397-0029 AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
1737-142397-0030 BILL'S COVETED BOOTY TOO I COULD EASILY GUESS AT THAT IT CAME FROM THE VICAR'S STORE OF BISCUITS KEPT AS I KNEW
1737-142397-0031 THEN I PASSED ON MY WAY I PROTEST I WAS NOT ON BILL'S SIDE BUT THEN NEITHER WAS I ON THE VICAR'S
1737-142397-0032 AND I FELT SURE AS I RAMBLED OFF IN HIS WAKE THAT HE HAD MORE HOLIDAY MATTER TO SHOW ME AND SO INDEED HE HAD AND ALL OF IT WAS TO THE SAME LAWLESS TUNE LIKE A BLACK PIRATE FLAG ON THE BLUE OCEAN OF AIR A HAWK HUNG OMINOUS THEN PLUMMET WISE DROPPED TO THE HEDGEROW
1737-142397-0033 WHENCE THERE ROSE THIN AND SHRILL A PITEOUS VOICE OF SQUEALING BY THE TIME I GOT THERE A WHISK OF FEATHERS ON THE TURF LIKE SCATTERED PLAYBILLS WAS ALL THAT REMAINED TO TELL OF THE TRAGEDY JUST ENACTED YET NATURE SMILED AND SANG ON PITILESS GAY IMPARTIAL
1737-142397-0034 TO HER WHO TOOK NO SIDES THERE WAS EVERY BIT AS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THE HAWK AS FOR THE CHAFFINCH BOTH WERE HER CHILDREN AND SHE WOULD SHOW NO PREFERENCES FURTHER ON A HEDGEHOG LAY DEAD ATHWART THE PATH NAY MORE THAN DEAD DECADENT DISTINCTLY
1737-142397-0035 A SORRY SIGHT FOR ONE THAT HAD KNOWN THE FELLOW IN MORE BUSTLING CIRCUMSTANCES NATURE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE PAUSED TO SHED ONE TEAR OVER THIS ROUGH JACKETED LITTLE SON OF HERS FOR HIS WASTED AIMS HIS CANCELLED AMBITIONS HIS WHOLE CAREER OF USEFULNESS CUT SUDDENLY SHORT BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1737-142397-0036 JUBILANT AS EVER HER SONG WENT BUBBLING ON AND DEATH IN LIFE AND AGAIN LIFE IN DEATH WERE ITS ALTERNATE BURDENS AND LOOKING ROUND AND SEEING THE SHEEP NIBBLED HEELS OF TURNIPS THAT DOTTED THE GROUND THEIR HEARTS EATEN OUT OF THEM IN FROST BOUND DAYS NOW OVER AND DONE
1737-142397-0037 I SEEMED TO DISCERN FAINTLY A SOMETHING OF THE STERN MEANING IN HER VALOROUS CHANT MY INVISIBLE COMPANION WAS SINGING ALSO AND SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE CHUCKLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF DOUBTLESS AT THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE NEW LESSONS HE WAS TEACHING ME
1737-142397-0038 PERHAPS TOO AT A SPECIAL BIT OF WAGGISHNESS HE HAD STILL IN STORE FOR WHEN AT LAST HE GREW WEARY OF SUCH INSIGNIFICANT EARTHBOUND COMPANY HE DESERTED ME AT A CERTAIN SPOT I KNEW THEN DROPPED SUBSIDED AND SLUNK AWAY INTO NOTHINGNESS
1737-142397-0039 STOOD THE ANCIENT WHIPPING POST OF THE VILLAGE ITS SIDES FRETTED WITH THE INITIALS OF A GENERATION THAT SCORNED ITS MUTE LESSON BUT STILL CLIPPED BY THE STOUT RUSTY SHACKLES THAT HAD TETHERED THE WRISTS
1737-142397-0040 HAD I BEEN AN INFANT STERNE HERE WAS A GRAND CHANCE FOR SENTIMENTAL OUTPUT AS THINGS WERE I COULD ONLY HURRY HOMEWARDS MY MORAL TAIL WELL BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH AN UNEASY FEELING AS I GLANCED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER THAT THERE WAS MORE IN THIS CHANCE THAN MET THE EYE
1737-142397-0041 HAROLD IT FURTHER APPEARED GREATLY COVETING TADPOLES AND TOP HEAVY WITH THE EAGERNESS OF POSSESSION HAD FALLEN INTO THE POND THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOTHING BUT ON ATTEMPTING TO SNEAK IN
1737-142397-0042 BY THE BACK DOOR HE HAD RENDERED UP HIS DUCKWEED BEDABBLED PERSON INTO THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND HAD BEEN PROMPTLY SENT OFF TO BED AND THIS ON A HOLIDAY WAS VERY MUCH
5778-54535-0000 HE MEANT TO HAVE IT ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO HE CALLED AN OFFICER INTO HIS COUNCIL CHAMBER AND SAID NOW TAKE PLENTY OF TIME TO LOOK ABOUT IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE ALL THE MEN YOU WANT TO HELP YOU
5778-54535-0001 BUT FIND ME SOMEWHERE AN ENGINEER THAT WILL LAY OUT A PERFECT RAILROAD LINE MEN APPOINTED BY THIS COLONEL TRAVELED SOME MONTHS THEY VISITED MANY CITIES WROTE LETTERS AND ASKED ADVICE THEN THE COLONEL WENT BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID
5778-54535-0002 THE MAN YOU NEED TO DO THIS PIECE OF WORK LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHAT'S HIS NAME ASKED NICOLAS HE IS MAJOR GEORGE WASHINGTON WHISTLER HE IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE CITY IN WHICH HE LIVES LOWELL MASSACHUSETTS
5778-54535-0003 HE IS A DISTINGUISHED ARMY OFFICER AND A FINE ENGINEER HE IS NAMED FOR A GREAT OFFICER ANSWERED NICOLAS REMEMBERING OUR GENERAL WASHINGTON AND HE DISPATCHED A LETTER TO THE LOWELL ENGINEER
5778-54535-0004 THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY
5778-54535-0005 BUT HE TOLD THE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND TO MIND THEIR MOTHER THESE BOYS WERE NAMED JAMES MC NEILL WILLIAM AND CHARLES THEIR MOTHER WAS A FINE WOMAN BUT SOMETIMES THEY WISHED SHE WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO STRICT
5778-54535-0006 SHE USED TO SAY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS COME BOYS EMPTY YOUR POCKETS AND GATHER UP YOUR TOYS WE WILL PUT THE KNIVES AND MARBLES AWAY AND GET READY FOR SUNDAY ALL DAY SUNDAY THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO READ ANY BOOK BUT THE BIBLE
5778-54535-0007 BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE
5778-54535-0008 ONE OF HIS UNCLES WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY USED TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS THIS WAS A GREAT ENGLISH PAINTER WHO HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE COME OUT OF HIS GRAVE TO PAINT JIMMIE ASLEEP
5778-54535-0009 JIMMIE HAD DELICATE FEATURES AND LONG SILKY BROWN CURLS THAT HUNG ABOUT HIS FACE IN AMONG THESE WAS ONE WHITE LOCK THAT DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN OVER HIS FOREHEAD THIS LOOKED LIKE A TINY FEATHER
5778-54535-0010 MORE THAN ALL HIS PLAYTHINGS HE LIKED A PENCIL AND PAPER FROM THE TIME HE COULD SCRIBBLE AT ALL HE DREW PICTURES OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
5778-54535-0011 THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA
5778-54535-0012 IT WAS A LONG HARD VOYAGE THERE AND POOR LITTLE CHARLIE DIED ON THE WAY THE TWO OTHER BOYS WERE BETTER SAILORS AND WERE AS WELL AS COULD BE WHEN THEY MET THEIR FATHER THEY DID ENJOY THE STRANGE SIGHTS IN SAINT PETERSBURG
5778-54535-0013 THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
5778-54535-0014 STILL THEIR PARENTS DID NOT LET THEM FORGET THEY WERE LITTLE AMERICANS THE CLIMATE DID NOT AGREE WITH JAMES AND EVERY TIME HE CAUGHT COLD HE HAD TOUCHES OF RHEUMATISM SO THAT OFTEN HE HAD TO STAY IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE HIS FEET PUT IN HOT WATER
5778-54535-0015 INSTEAD OF MAKING A FUSS ABOUT THIS HE USED TO CALL FOR PENCIL AND PAPER AND PRACTISE DRAWING FEET UNTIL HE COULD MAKE VERY PERFECT ONES MAJOR WHISTLER SENT HIM TO THE ART ACADEMY IN SAINT PETERSBURG WHERE HE WAS PRAISED BY HIS TEACHERS
5778-54535-0016 THAT OLD TIRESOME RHEUMATISM KEPT BOTHERING HIM AND BY AND BY HE HAD A LONG RHEUMATIC FEVER
5778-54535-0017 HE WAS A DEAR PATIENT BOY HOWEVER AND AFTERWARDS DECLARED HE WAS ALMOST GLAD HE HAD IT BECAUSE SOME ONE WHO PITIED THE SMALL INVALID SENT HIM A BOOK OF HOGARTH'S ENGRAVINGS
5778-54535-0018 I WANT YOU TO BE SURE AND REMEMBER ABOUT THIS GENTLENESS AND PATIENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN ACCUSED HIM OF BEING CROSS AND RUDE BUT AT THIS TIME I AM SURE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN NICER
5778-54535-0019 JAMES WAS VERY CAREFUL OF HIS MOTHER TOO ONE EVENING SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOYS IN A CARRIAGE TO SEE A BIG ILLUMINATION BANDS WERE PLAYING AND ROCKETS FLYING
5778-54535-0020 THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM
5778-54535-0021 HE ALWAYS WAS AS POLITE TO HER AS IF SHE WERE THE EMPEROR'S WIFE THE MAJOR WORKED TOO HARD ON THE GREAT RAILWAY AND DIED BEFORE JAMES WAS FIFTEEN
5778-54535-0022 THE EMPEROR WAS FOND OF THE TWO BOYS AND WANTED THEM TO STAY ON IN RUSSIA AND BE TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL FOR PAGES OF THE COURT BUT THEIR MOTHER SAID THEY MUST GROW UP IN AMERICA AND HURRIED BACK TO HER OWN LAND
5778-54535-0023 SHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY TO SPEND BUT THOUGHT JAMES SHOULD GO TO WEST POINT TO GET THE MILITARY TRAINING HIS FATHER HAD HAD AT THIS ACADEMY HE FOUND HE DID NOT LIKE TO DRAW MAPS AND FORTS NEARLY AS WELL AS HE DID HUMAN FIGURES AND FACES
5778-54535-0024 ONCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN SENT TO WASHINGTON TO DRAW MAPS FOR THE COAST SURVEY HE FORGOT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND FILLED UP THE NICE WHITE MARGINS WITH PERT LITTLE DANCING FOLKS HE WAS WELL SCOLDED FOR THIS I CAN TELL YOU
5778-54535-0025 JAMES WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AT THIS TIME AND LIKED TO GO ABOUT TO DANCING PARTIES IN THE EVENING HE EARNED VERY LITTLE MAKING MAPS AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE REAL NARROW TAILED COAT WHICH WAS PROPER
5778-54535-0026 SO HE USED TO TAKE HIS FROCK COAT THAT HE WORE ALL DAY AND PIN IT BACK TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS COAT AND START OFF FOR BIG BALLS WHERE NOBODY WAS MUCH SHOCKED BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING DROLL THINGS AND WAS SO LIVELY THAT HE WAS WELCOME IN ANY DRESS
5778-54535-0027 AND THE MAP DRAWING HAD GROWN SO TIRESOME THAT JAMES HAD GIVEN UP WEST POINT AND SETTLED DOWN TO PAINTING AND ETCHING IN PARIS HE HAD DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH SUITED HIM BUT THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST
5778-54535-0028 HE WORKED QUITE STEADILY AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I THINK YOUNG WHISTLER IS GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS SOME DAY BUT SUDDENLY HE PACKED UP AND WENT TO LONDON
5778-54535-0029 IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0030 THE ROOM LOOKED SO BARE AND HOMELY THAT WHISTLER PAINTED A VERY GOOD IMITATION OF FURNITURE ROUND THE WALLS OF HIS ROOM SO GOOD IN FACT THAT A RICH MAN WHO CAME TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE IMITATION CHAIRS AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE FLOOR
5778-54535-0031 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT JAMES COULD GO A LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD FOR IT TOOK NEARLY ALL HE COULD EARN FROM HIS PICTURES TO BUY PAINT AND CANVAS FOR OTHERS I DARE SAY THAT QUITE OFTEN WHEN IT WAS SAID
5778-54535-0032 JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER IS GROWING RUDE AND CROSS THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER WAS HUNGRY AND WORRIED
5778-54535-0033 HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AT LAST AND JUST AS LIFE SEEMED BRIGHT AN ART CRITIC MISTER JOHN RUSKIN DECLARED THAT THE WHISTLER PICTURES WHICH WERE BEING BOUGHT AT BIG PRICES WERE POOR VERY POOR
5778-54535-0034 MISTER RUSKIN SPOKE AND WHAT WAS WORSE PRINTED HIS OPINION I NEVER EXPECTED HE WROTE TO HEAR A COXCOMB ASK TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR FLINGING A POT OF PAINT IN THE PUBLIC'S FACE
5778-54535-0035 WELL IT DID NOT LOOK FOR A WHILE AS IF THERE WAS ANY MORE GOOD LUCK IN THE WORLD FOR JAMES WHISTLER HE DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME IN GETTING A LAWYER TO SUE MISTER RUSKIN FOR SPOILING THE SALE OF HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0036 THERE WAS A TRIAL IN LONDON AND THE COURT ROOM WAS CROWDED SOME WERE THERE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY OWNED WHISTLER PICTURES AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD PAID GOOD MONEY FOR BAD PICTURES OTHERS BECAUSE THEY WERE WARM FRIENDS OF THE ARTIST OR THE CRITIC
5778-54535-0037 BUT EVEN MORE MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO HEAR THE SHARP QUESTIONS OF THE LAWYERS AND THE CLEVER ANSWERS OF RUSKIN AND WHISTLER WHISTLER WON THE CASE WHEN THE JUDGE AWARDED ONE FARTHING FOR DAMAGES THIS IS ONLY A QUARTER OF A CENT IN OUR MONEY
5778-54535-0038 WHISTLER LAUGHED AND HUNG THE ENGLISH FARTHING ON HIS WATCH CHAIN FOR A CHARM MISTER RUSKIN HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH HAD MOUNTED UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS INSISTED ON RAISING THAT SUM FOR HIM
5778-54535-0039 ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS WORTH NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE HEARD THE TALK THAT WENT ON IN THE COURT ROOM LATER MISTER WHISTLER RECEIVED MUCH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR A SINGLE PICTURE
5778-54535-0040 TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
5778-54535-0041 AND HER SON LOVED HER JUST AS DEARLY AS HE DID WHEN HE BEAT THE PRANCING HORSES AWAY FROM HER IN RUSSIA THE FRENCH NATION BOUGHT THIS PORTRAIT AND IT HANGS IN THE LUXEMBOURG MUSEUM PARIS
5778-54535-0042 THE SCOTCH PEOPLE WANTED TO OWN THE PORTRAIT OF CARLYLE AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW WAS GLAD TO PAY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IT MISTER WHISTLER MARRIED A WOMAN WHO WAS HERSELF AN ARTIST AND SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIM
5778-54535-0043 THE DUET ONE OF HIS PICTURES SHOWS HIS WIFE AND HER SISTER AT THE PIANO TWO PORTRAITS BY THIS AMERICAN ARTIST HANG IN THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED IN ENGLAND
5778-54535-0044 JAMES WHISTLER WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOUNG ARTISTS AND LIKED TO HAVE THEM SIT BY HIM WHILE HE WORKED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY HIM FOR LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF HONORS AND MEDALS FROM FOREIGN ACADEMIES
5778-54535-0045 AND FRANCE GERMANY AND ITALY MADE HIM AN OFFICER OF THE LEGION OF HONOR A COMMANDER AND A CHEVALIER
5778-54535-0046 HE LOVED ART SO WELL THAT HE MADE WATER COLORS PASTELS ETCHINGS AND LITHOGRAPHS AS WELL AS OIL PAINTINGS HE DID NOT GET HIS FAME WITHOUT MUCH HARD WORK
5778-54535-0047 YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
5778-54535-0048 HE TRAVELED A GREAT DEAL PAINTING VIEWS IN MANY COUNTRIES AND STUDYING THE PICTURES OF OTHER ARTISTS BUT HOGARTH WAS HIS FAVORITE AND IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER LIES BURIED VERY NEAR HOGARTH IN LONDON
4788-94904-0000 WE HAVE RECOGNIZED IN REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE IDEAL TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECT POLITY FOR WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE ANY PORTION OF MANKIND ARE BETTER ADAPTED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AS THEY RANGE LOWER AND LOWER IN DEVELOPMENT
4788-94904-0001 THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE GENERALLY SPEAKING LESS SUITABLE TO THEM THOUGH THIS IS NOT TRUE UNIVERSALLY FOR THE ADAPTATION OF A PEOPLE TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DEPEND SO MUCH UPON THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE GENERAL SCALE OF HUMANITY
4788-94904-0002 AS UPON THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS CERTAIN SPECIAL REQUISITES REQUISITES HOWEVER SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL ADVANCEMENT THAT ANY VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO IS RATHER THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE
4788-94904-0003 THAT THEY SHOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE TO FULFILL THE DUTIES AND DISCHARGE THE FUNCTIONS WHICH IT IMPOSES ON THEM THE WILLINGNESS OF THE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT ONLY BECOMES A PRACTICAL QUESTION WHEN AN ENLIGHTENED RULER OR A FOREIGN NATION OR NATIONS
4788-94904-0004 WHO HAVE GAINED POWER OVER THE COUNTRY ARE DISPOSED TO OFFER IT THE BOON TO INDIVIDUAL REFORMERS THE QUESTION IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT SINCE IF NO OTHER OBJECTION CAN BE MADE TO THEIR ENTERPRISE THAN THAT THE OPINION OF THE NATION IS NOT YET ON THEIR SIDE
4788-94904-0005 THEY HAVE THE READY AND PROPER ANSWER THAT TO BRING IT OVER TO THEIR SIDE IS THE VERY END THEY AIM AT WHEN OPINION IS REALLY ADVERSE ITS HOSTILITY IS USUALLY TO THE FACT OF CHANGE RATHER THAN TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN ITSELF
4788-94904-0006 THE CONTRARY CASE IS NOT INDEED UNEXAMPLED THERE HAS SOMETIMES BEEN A RELIGIOUS REPUGNANCE TO ANY LIMITATION OF THE POWER OF A PARTICULAR LINE OF RULERS BUT IN GENERAL THE DOCTRINE OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE MEANT ONLY SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF THE POWERS THAT BE
4788-94904-0007 WHETHER MONARCHICAL OR POPULAR IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE MADE INDIFFERENCE TO IT
4788-94904-0008 RATHER THAN POSITIVE OPPOSITION ARE THE OBSTACLES TO BE EXPECTED THESE HOWEVER ARE AS FATAL AND MAY BE AS HARD TO BE GOT RID OF AS ACTUAL AVERSION IT BEING EASIER IN MOST CASES TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTIVE FEELING THAN TO CREATE ONE
4788-94904-0009 IN A STATE PREVIOUSLY PASSIVE WHEN A PEOPLE HAVE NO SUFFICIENT VALUE FOR AND ATTACHMENT TO A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION THEY HAVE NEXT TO NO CHANCE OF RETAINING IT
4788-94904-0010 AND IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO IT PRINCIPALLY THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DIRECTED AND BY IT BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE TERRORS AND PRESTIGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE MAINLY REPRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EYE
4788-94904-0011 UNLESS THEREFORE THE AUTHORITIES WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE ARE BACKED BY AN EFFECTIVE OPINION AND FEELING IN THE COUNTRY THE EXECUTIVE HAS ALWAYS THE MEANS OF SETTING THEM ASIDE OR COMPELLING THEM TO SUBSERVIENCE
4788-94904-0012 AND IS SURE TO BE WELL SUPPORTED IN DOING SO REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS NECESSARILY DEPEND FOR PERMANENCE UPON THE READINESS OF THE PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR THEM IN CASE OF THEIR BEING ENDANGERED IF TOO LITTLE VALUED FOR THIS
4788-94904-0013 THEY SELDOM OBTAIN A FOOTING AT ALL AND IF THEY DO ARE ALMOST SURE TO BE OVERTHROWN AS SOON AS THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY PARTY LEADER WHO CAN MUSTER FORCE FOR A COUP DE MAIN IS WILLING TO RUN SOME SMALL RISK FOR ABSOLUTE POWER
4788-94904-0014 THESE CONSIDERATIONS RELATE TO THE FIRST TWO CAUSES OF FAILURE IN A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE THIRD IS WHEN THE PEOPLE WANT EITHER THE WILL OR THE CAPACITY TO FULFILL THE PART WHICH BELONGS TO THEM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION
4788-94904-0015 WHEN NOBODY OR ONLY SOME SMALL FRACTION FEELS THE DEGREE OF INTEREST IN THE GENERAL AFFAIRS OF THE STATE NECESSARY TO THE FORMATION OF A PUBLIC OPINION THE ELECTORS WILL SELDOM MAKE ANY USE OF THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE BUT TO SERVE THEIR PRIVATE INTEREST OR THE INTEREST OF THEIR LOCALITY
4788-94904-0016 OR OF SOME ONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE CONNECTED AS ADHERENTS OR DEPENDENTS THE SMALL CLASS WHO IN THIS STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING GAIN THE COMMAND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY FOR THE MOST PART USE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS OF SEEKING THEIR FORTUNE IF THE EXECUTIVE IS WEAK
4788-94904-0017 THE COUNTRY IS DISTRACTED BY MERE STRUGGLES FOR PLACE IF STRONG IT MAKES ITSELF DESPOTIC AT THE CHEAP PRICE OF APPEASING THE REPRESENTATIVES OR SUCH OF THEM AS ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING TROUBLE BY A SHARE OF THE SPOIL
4788-94904-0018 AND THE ONLY FRUIT PRODUCED BY NATIONAL REPRESENTATION IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHO REALLY GOVERN THERE IS AN ASSEMBLY QUARTERED ON THE PUBLIC AND NO ABUSE IN WHICH A PORTION OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE INTERESTED IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE REMOVED
4788-94904-0019 WHEN HOWEVER THE EVIL STOPS HERE THE PRICE MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR THE PUBLICITY AND DISCUSSION WHICH THOUGH NOT AN INVARIABLE ARE A NATURAL ACCOMPANIMENT OF ANY EVEN NOMINAL REPRESENTATION
4788-94904-0020 THAT THE PLACE HUNTERS WHO CHIEFLY COMPOSE THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING DIRECTLY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT NOR EVEN MUCH TEMPER THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE
4788-94904-0021 WHICH EXISTS IN THAT COUNTRY THIS BENEFIT HOWEVER IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE COEXISTENCE WITH THE POPULAR BODY OF AN HEREDITARY KING IF INSTEAD OF STRUGGLING FOR THE FAVORS OF THE CHIEF RULER THESE SELFISH AND SORDID FACTIONS STRUGGLED FOR THE CHIEF PLACE ITSELF
4788-94904-0022 THEY WOULD CERTAINLY AS IN SPANISH AMERICA KEEP THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF CHRONIC REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR A DESPOTISM NOT EVEN LEGAL BUT OF ILLEGAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE ALTERNATELY EXERCISED BY A SUCCESSION OF POLITICAL ADVENTURERS
4788-94904-0023 AND THE NAME AND FORMS OF REPRESENTATION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT BUT TO PREVENT DESPOTISM FROM ATTAINING THE STABILITY AND SECURITY BY WHICH ALONE ITS EVILS CAN BE MITIGATED OR ITS FEW ADVANTAGES REALIZED
4788-94904-0024 THERE ARE OTHERS IN WHICH IT POSSIBLY MIGHT EXIST BUT IN WHICH SOME OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREFERABLE THESE ARE PRINCIPALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO ADVANCE IN CIVILIZATION HAVE SOME LESSON TO LEARN SOME HABIT NOT YET ACQUIRED
4788-94904-0025 TO THE ACQUISITION OF WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE CASES IS THE ONE ALREADY CONSIDERED IN WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE STILL TO LEARN THE FIRST LESSON OF CIVILIZATION THAT OF OBEDIENCE
4788-94904-0026 A RACE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN ENERGY AND COURAGE BY STRUGGLES WITH NATURE AND THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT WHO HAVE NOT YET SETTLED DOWN INTO PERMANENT OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMON SUPERIOR WOULD BE LITTLE LIKELY TO ACQUIRE THIS HABIT UNDER THE COLLECTIVE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN BODY
4788-94904-0027 A REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY DRAWN FROM AMONG THEMSELVES WOULD SIMPLY REFLECT THEIR OWN TURBULENT INSUBORDINATION IT WOULD REFUSE ITS AUTHORITY TO ALL PROCEEDINGS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE ON THEIR SAVAGE INDEPENDENCE ANY IMPROVING RESTRAINT
4788-94904-0028 A MILITARY LEADER IS THE ONLY SUPERIOR TO WHOM THEY WILL SUBMIT EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY SOME PROPHET SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRED FROM ABOVE OR CONJURER REGARDED AS POSSESSING MIRACULOUS POWER THESE MAY EXERCISE A TEMPORARY ASCENDANCY
4788-94904-0029 BUT AS IT IS MERELY PERSONAL IT RARELY EFFECTS ANY CHANGE IN THE GENERAL HABITS OF THE PEOPLE UNLESS THE PROPHET LIKE MOHAMMED IS ALSO A MILITARY CHIEF AND GOES FORTH THE ARMED APOSTLE OF A NEW RELIGION
4788-94904-0030 OR UNLESS THE MILITARY CHIEFS ALLY THEMSELVES WITH HIS INFLUENCE AND TURN IT INTO A PROP FOR THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT A PEOPLE ARE NO LESS UNFITTED FOR REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT BY THE CONTRARY FAULT TO THAT LAST SPECIFIED BY EXTREME PASSIVENESS
4788-94904-0031 AND READY SUBMISSION TO TYRANNY IF A PEOPLE THUS PROSTRATED BY CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES COULD OBTAIN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS THEY WOULD INEVITABLY CHOOSE THEIR TYRANTS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE YOKE WOULD BE MADE HEAVIER ON THEM BY THE CONTRIVANCE WHICH
4788-94904-0032 MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO LIGHTEN IT ON THE CONTRARY MANY A PEOPLE HAS GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM THIS CONDITION BY THE AID OF A CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHOSE POSITION HAS MADE IT THE RIVAL AND HAS ENDED BY MAKING IT THE MASTER OF THE LOCAL DESPOTS
4788-94904-0033 EVEN WHEN THE KING WAS SCARCELY SO POWERFUL AS MANY OF HIS CHIEF FEUDATORIES THE GREAT ADVANTAGE WHICH HE DERIVED FROM BEING BUT ONE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY FRENCH HISTORIANS TO HIM THE EYES OF ALL THE LOCALLY OPPRESSED WERE TURNED
4788-94904-0034 HE WAS THE OBJECT OF HOPE AND RELIANCE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WHILE EACH LOCAL POTENTATE WAS ONLY POWERFUL WITHIN A MORE OR LESS CONFINED SPACE AT HIS HANDS REFUGE AND PROTECTION WERE SOUGHT FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST FIRST ONE
4788-94904-0035 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
4788-94904-0036 IT ABATED IN THE OPPRESSED PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY THE HABIT OF SUBMITTING TO OPPRESSION THE KING'S INTEREST LAY IN ENCOURAGING ALL PARTIAL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE SERFS TO EMANCIPATE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR MASTERS AND PLACE THEMSELVES IN IMMEDIATE SUBORDINATION TO HIMSELF
4788-94904-0037 UNDER HIS PROTECTION NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES WERE FORMED WHICH KNEW NO ONE ABOVE THEM BUT THE KING
4788-94904-0038 AND THE MONARCH WAS LONG COMPELLED BY NECESSITIES OF POSITION TO EXERT HIS AUTHORITY AS THE ALLY RATHER THAN THE MASTER OF THE CLASSES WHOM HE HAD AIDED IN AFFECTING THEIR LIBERATION IN THIS MANNER A CENTRAL POWER DESPOTIC IN PRINCIPLE
4788-94904-0039 THOUGH GENERALLY MUCH RESTRICTED IN PRACTICE WAS MAINLY INSTRUMENTAL IN CARRYING THE PEOPLE THROUGH A NECESSARY STAGE OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IF REAL WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE PREVENTED THEM FROM ENTERING UPON
4788-91208-0000 IT LOOKS BIG AND IMPORTANT AND IT MAKES A GREAT NOISE EVEN PEOPLE A LONG WAY UP IN THE SCALE OF CIVILIZATION ARE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING THESE ATTRIBUTES PERHAPS NOT AS THE ESSENTIAL ONES OF LEADERSHIP BUT AT ALL EVENTS AS THOSE BY WHICH A LEADER MAY BE RECOGNIZED
4788-91208-0001 THE POINTSMAN MOVES A HANDLE AND THE FOAMING GIANT THAT WOULD IT MAY BE HAVE SPED ON TO HIS DESTRUCTION AND THAT OF THE PASSIVE CREW WHO FOLLOW IN HIS REAR IS SHUNTED TO ANOTHER LINE RUNNING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND TO A MORE DESIRABLE GOAL
4788-91208-0002 THE GREAT INTELLECTUAL POINTSMAN OF OUR AGE THE MAN WHO HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GENERATION TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE THOUGHT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAS PASSED AWAY AND WE ARE LEFT TO MEASURE THE LOSS TO HUMANITY BY THE RESULT OF HIS LABORS
4788-91208-0003 MISTER MILL'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN BOTH BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY ARE SUCH AS TO GIVE HIM THE FOREMOST PLACE IN EITHER WHETHER WE REGARD HIM AS AN EXPOUNDER OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND OR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIETY HE IS
4788-91208-0004 THE STRUCTURE RAISED BY ADAM SMITH MALTHUS AND RICARDO BUT RAISED IT AT LEAST ONE STORY HIGHER HIS INESTIMABLE SYSTEM OF LOGIC WAS A REVOLUTION IT HARDLY NEEDS OF COURSE TO BE SAID THAT HE OWED MUCH TO HIS PREDECESSORS
4788-91208-0005 THAT HE BORROWED FROM WHEWELL MUCH OF HIS CLASSIFICATION FROM BROWN THE CHIEF LINES OF HIS THEORY OF CAUSATION FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE INDUCTIVE METHODS THOSE WHO THINK THIS A DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS WORK MUST HAVE VERY LITTLE CONCEPTION
4788-91208-0006 OF THE MASS OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT STILL REMAINS TO MISTER MILL'S CREDIT THE GREAT CRITICAL POWER THAT COULD GATHER VALUABLE TRUTHS FROM SO MANY DISCORDANT SOURCES AND THE WONDERFUL SYNTHETIC ABILITY REQUIRED TO WELD THESE AND HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS
4788-91208-0007 INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE WHEN MISTER MILL COMMENCED HIS LABORS THE ONLY LOGIC RECOGNIZED WAS THE SYLLOGISTIC
4788-91208-0008 IN DEDUCING FROM GENERAL PROPOSITIONS OTHER PROPOSITIONS LESS GENERAL IT WAS EVEN ASSERTED CONFIDENTLY THAT NOTHING MORE WAS TO BE EXPECTED THAT AN INDUCTIVE LOGIC WAS IMPOSSIBLE THIS CONCEPTION OF LOGICAL SCIENCE NECESSITATED
4788-91208-0009 SOME GENERAL PROPOSITIONS TO START WITH AND THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS BEING EX
4788-91208-0010 INCAPABLE OF BEING PROVED FROM OTHER PROPOSITIONS IT FOLLOWED THAT IF THEY WERE KNOWN TO US AT ALL THEY MUST BE ORIGINAL DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE WAS A PERFECT PARADISE OF QUESTION BEGGING THE ULTIMATE MAJOR PREMISE IN EVERY ARGUMENT BEING ASSUMED
4788-91208-0011 IT COULD OF COURSE BE FASHIONED ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR CONCLUSION IT WAS CALLED IN TO PROVE THUS AN ARTIFICIAL IGNORANCE AS LOCKE CALLS IT WAS PRODUCED WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF SANCTIFYING PREJUDICE BY RECOGNIZING SO CALLED NECESSITIES OF THOUGHT
4788-91208-0012 AS THE ONLY BASES OF REASONING IT IS TRUE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE LOGIC OF THE SCHOOLS GREAT ADVANCES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE RULES OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION BUT THESE RULES WERE NOT ONLY IMPERFECT IN THEMSELVES BUT THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE LAW OF CAUSATION
4788-91208-0013 WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY REALIZED AND THEIR TRUE RELATION TO SYLLOGISM HARDLY DREAMT OF MISTER MILL ALTERED ALL THIS HE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GENERAL TYPE OF REASONING IS NEITHER FROM GENERALS TO PARTICULARS NOR FROM PARTICULARS TO GENERALS BUT FROM PARTICULARS TO PARTICULARS
4788-91208-0014 BUT ARE NOW DEAD WE ARE ENTITLED TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORTAL WE MIGHT SURELY WITHOUT ANY LOGICAL INCONSEQUENCE HAVE CONCLUDED AT ONCE FROM THOSE INSTANCES THAT THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IS MORTAL
4788-91208-0015 THE MORTALITY OF JOHN THOMAS AND OTHERS IS AFTER ALL THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR THE MORTALITY OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON NOT ONE IOTA IS ADDED TO THE PROOF BY INTERPOLATING A GENERAL PROPOSITION
4788-91208-0016 WE NOT ONLY MAY ACCORDING TO MISTER MILL REASON FROM SOME PARTICULAR INSTANCES TO OTHERS BUT WE FREQUENTLY DO SO AS HOWEVER THE INSTANCES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE ONE FRESH INSTANCE
4788-91208-0017 THE WORK OF DEDUCTION IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE FORMULAS AND THEREFORE STRICTLY SPEAKING IS NOT INFERENTIAL AT ALL THE REAL INFERENCE WAS ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITION WAS ARRIVED AT
4788-91208-0018 ALL REASONING IS SHOWN TO BE AT BOTTOM INDUCTIVE INDUCTIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF LOGIC AND TO INDUCTION ACCORDINGLY MISTER MILL DEVOTED HIS CHIEF ATTENTION FOR THE FIRST TIME INDUCTION WAS TREATED AS THE OPUS MAGNUM OF LOGIC
4788-91208-0019 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE TRACED TO THEIR INDUCTIVE ORIGIN IT WAS THIS TAKEN WITH HIS THEORY OF THE SYLLOGISM WHICH WORKED THE GREAT CHANGE BOTH HIS SYSTEM OF LOGIC AND HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY
4788-91208-0020 ARE FOR THE MOST PART DEVOTED TO FORTIFYING THIS POSITION AND DEMOLISHING BELIEFS INCONSISTENT WITH IT AS A SYSTEMATIC PSYCHOLOGIST MISTER MILL HAS NOT DONE SO MUCH AS EITHER PROFESSOR BAIN OR MISTER HERBERT SPENCER
4788-91208-0021 THE PERFECTION OF HIS METHOD ITS APPLICATION AND THE UPROOTING OF PREJUDICES WHICH STOOD IN ITS WAY THIS WAS THE TASK TO WHICH MISTER MILL APPLIED HIMSELF WITH AN ABILITY AND SUCCESS RARELY MATCHED AND NEVER SURPASSED
4788-91208-0022 THE BIGGEST LION IN THE PATH WAS THE DOCTRINE OF SO CALLED NECESSARY TRUTH THIS DOCTRINE WAS ESPECIALLY OBNOXIOUS TO HIM AS IT SET UP A PURELY SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF TRUTH AND A STANDARD AS HE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SHOW
4788-91208-0023 VARYING ACCORDING TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SUCH THINKERS AS DOCTOR WHEWELL AND MISTER HERBERT SPENCER HAD TO BE MET IN INTELLECTUAL COMBAT DOCTOR WHEWELL HELD NOT THAT THE INCONCEIVABILITY
4788-91208-0024 OF THE CONTRADICTORY OF A PROPOSITION IS A PROOF OF ITS TRUTH CO EQUAL WITH EXPERIENCE BUT THAT ITS VALUE TRANSCENDS EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE MAY TELL US WHAT IS BUT IT IS BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONCEIVING IT OTHERWISE
4788-91208-0025 IN HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL GIVES BATTLE TO THIS MODE OF THOUGHT AFTER REVIEWING IN AN OPENING CHAPTER THE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD RESPECTING THE RELATIVITY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
4788-91208-0026 AS MISTER MILL SAYS THE NAME OF GOD IS VEILED UNDER TWO EXTREMELY ABSTRACT PHRASES INFINITE AND THE ABSOLUTE SO PROFOUND AND FRIENDLY A THINKER AS THE LATE MISTER GROTE HELD THIS RAISING OF THE VEIL INEXPEDIENT BUT HE PROVED
4788-91208-0027 BY A MISTAKE HE FELL INTO THE NECESSITY OF LOOKING AT THE MATTER IN THE CONCRETE HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FORCE OF MISTER MILL'S ARGUMENT THAT THE INFINITE MUST INCLUDE A FARRAGO OF CONTRADICTIONS
4788-91208-0028 IN WHICH THESE CONTRADICTORY ATTRIBUTES INHERE BUT IT WAS AGAINST A CORRESPONDING BEING THE INFINITE THAT MISTER MILL WAS ARGUING IT IS THIS THAT HE CALLS A
4788-91208-0029 AND REGARDED AS THE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDISSIMUM OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL'S RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES MAY VERY WELL BE GATHERED FROM A PASSAGE IN HIS REVIEW OF AUGUSTE COMTE A PHILOSOPHER WITH WHOM HE AGREED ON ALL POINTS
4788-91208-0030 AND PRESCRIBE TO HIM A RULE OF LIFE THAT PERSON HAS A RELIGION AND THOUGH EVERY ONE NATURALLY PREFERS HIS OWN RELIGION TO ANY OTHER ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IF THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND OF THIS FEELING OF DUTY IS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES
4788-91208-0031 THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
4788-91208-0032 AND WE JOIN WITH HIM IN CONTEMNING AS EQUALLY IRRATIONAL AND MEAN THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN NATURE AS INCAPABLE OF GIVING ITS LOVE AND DEVOTING ITS EXISTENCE TO ANY OBJECT WHICH CANNOT AFFORD IN EXCHANGE AN ETERNITY OF PERSONAL ENJOYMENT
4788-91208-0033 NEVER HAS THE LIBEL OF HUMANITY INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT THEOLOGY BEEN MORE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT WITH ITS CONSTANT APPEAL TO LOW MOTIVES OF PERSONAL GAIN
4788-91208-0034 AND ALL HIS RELATIONS TO HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE VERY BIRDS ABOUT HIS DWELLING SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT IT IS THIS NOBLE SENTIMENT WHICH INFUSES A SOUL OF LIFE INTO HIS TEACHINGS AND THE ENUNCIATION AND ACTING OUT OF WHICH CONSTITUTE HIM
5322-7679-0000 SUDDENLY IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SUN HAD SHONE INTO HIS SOUL HE HEARD RUSSIAN BEING SPOKEN AND ALSO HEARD THE RAPID SMOOTH FLOW OF THE TEREK AND A FEW STEPS FARTHER IN FRONT OF HIM SAW THE BROWN MOVING SURFACE OF THE RIVER
5322-7679-0001 WITH THE DIM COLOURED WET SAND OF ITS BANKS AND SHALLOWS THE DISTANT STEPPE THE CORDON WATCH TOWER OUTLINED ABOVE THE WATER A SADDLED AND HOBBLED HORSE AMONG THE BRAMBLES AND THEN THE MOUNTAINS OPENING OUT BEFORE HIM
5322-7679-0002 THE RED SUN APPEARED FOR AN INSTANT FROM UNDER A CLOUD AND ITS LAST RAYS GLITTERED BRIGHTLY ALONG THE RIVER OVER THE REEDS ON THE WATCH TOWER
5322-7679-0003 AND ON A GROUP OF COSSACKS AMONG WHOM LUKASHKA'S VIGOROUS FIGURE ATTRACTED OLENIN'S INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION OLENIN FELT THAT HE WAS AGAIN WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE PERFECTLY HAPPY
5322-7679-0004 HE HAD COME UPON THE NIZHNI PROTOTSK POST ON THE TEREK OPPOSITE A PRO RUSSIAN TARTAR VILLAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER HE ACCOSTED THE COSSACKS BUT NOT FINDING AS YET ANY EXCUSE FOR DOING ANYONE A KINDNESS HE ENTERED THE HUT
5322-7679-0005 BECAUSE THEY HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DIVERT THEM THAT EVENING SOME HOSTILE CHECHENS RELATIVES OF THE ABREK WHO HAD BEEN KILLED HAD COME FROM THE HILLS WITH A SCOUT TO RANSOM THE BODY
5322-7679-0006 AND THE COSSACKS WERE WAITING FOR THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER'S ARRIVAL FROM THE VILLAGE THE DEAD MAN'S BROTHER TALL AND WELL SHAPED WITH A SHORT CROPPED BEARD WHICH WAS DYED RED DESPITE HIS VERY TATTERED COAT AND CAP
5322-7679-0007 WAS CALM AND MAJESTIC AS A KING HIS FACE WAS VERY LIKE THAT OF THE DEAD ABREK HE DID NOT DEIGN TO LOOK AT ANYONE AND NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT THE DEAD BODY BUT SITTING ON HIS HEELS IN THE SHADE HE SPAT AS HE SMOKED HIS SHORT PIPE
5322-7679-0008 AND OCCASIONALLY UTTERED SOME FEW GUTTURAL SOUNDS OF COMMAND WHICH WERE RESPECTFULLY LISTENED TO BY HIS COMPANION HE WAS EVIDENTLY A BRAVE WHO HAD MET RUSSIANS MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE IN QUITE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOTHING ABOUT THEM COULD ASTONISH OR EVEN INTEREST HIM
5322-7679-0009 OLENIN WAS ABOUT TO APPROACH THE DEAD BODY AND HAD BEGUN TO LOOK AT IT WHEN THE BROTHER LOOKING UP AT HIM FROM UNDER HIS BROWS WITH CALM CONTEMPT SAID SOMETHING SHARPLY AND ANGRILY
5322-7679-0010 THE SCOUT HASTENED TO COVER THE DEAD MAN'S FACE WITH HIS COAT OLENIN WAS STRUCK
5322-7679-0011 HE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HIM ASKING FROM WHAT VILLAGE HE CAME BUT THE CHECHEN SCARCELY GIVING HIM A GLANCE SPAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND TURNED AWAY
5322-7679-0012 OLENIN WAS SO SURPRISED AT THE CHECHEN NOT BEING INTERESTED IN HIM THAT HE COULD ONLY PUT IT DOWN TO THE MAN'S STUPIDITY OR IGNORANCE OF RUSSIAN SO HE TURNED TO THE SCOUT WHO ALSO ACTED AS INTERPRETER THE SCOUT WAS AS RAGGED AS THE OTHER
5322-7679-0013 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING RED HAIRED HE WAS BLACK HAIRED RESTLESS WITH EXTREMELY WHITE GLEAMING TEETH AND SPARKLING BLACK EYES THE SCOUT WILLINGLY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION AND ASKED FOR A CIGARETTE THERE WERE FIVE BROTHERS
5322-7679-0014 BEGAN THE SCOUT IN HIS BROKEN RUSSIAN THIS IS THE THIRD BROTHER THE RUSSIANS HAVE KILLED ONLY TWO ARE LEFT HE IS A BRAVE A GREAT BRAVE HE SAID POINTING TO THE CHECHEN
5322-7679-0015 THIS ONE WAS SITTING ON THE OPPOSITE BANK AMONG THE REEDS HE SAW IT ALL SAW HIM LAID IN THE SKIFF AND BROUGHT TO THE BANK HE SAT THERE TILL THE NIGHT AND WISHED TO KILL THE OLD MAN BUT THE OTHERS WOULD NOT LET HIM
5322-7679-0016 LUKASHKA WENT UP TO THE SPEAKER AND SAT DOWN OF WHAT VILLAGE ASKED HE FROM THERE IN THE HILLS REPLIED THE SCOUT POINTING TO THE MISTY BLUISH GORGE BEYOND THE TEREK DO YOU KNOW SUUK SU IT IS ABOUT EIGHT MILES BEYOND THAT
5322-7679-0017 EVIDENTLY PROUD OF THE ACQUAINTANCE HE IS MY KUNAK HE IS MY NEIGHBOUR ANSWERED THE SCOUT HE'S A TRUMP AND LUKASHKA EVIDENTLY MUCH INTERESTED BEGAN TALKING TO THE SCOUT IN TARTAR PRESENTLY A COSSACK CAPTAIN
5322-7679-0018 WITH THE HEAD OF THE VILLAGE ARRIVED ON HORSEBACK WITH A SUITE OF TWO COSSACKS THE CAPTAIN ONE OF THE NEW TYPE OF COSSACK OFFICERS WISHED THE COSSACKS GOOD HEALTH BUT NO ONE SHOUTED IN REPLY HAIL GOOD HEALTH TO YOUR HONOUR
5322-7679-0019 AS IS CUSTOMARY IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND ONLY A FEW REPLIED WITH A BOW SOME AND AMONG THEM LUKASHKA ROSE AND STOOD ERECT THE CORPORAL REPLIED THAT ALL WAS WELL AT THE OUTPOSTS ALL THIS SEEMED RIDICULOUS
5322-7679-0020 IT WAS AS IF THESE COSSACKS WERE PLAYING AT BEING SOLDIERS BUT THESE FORMALITIES SOON GAVE PLACE TO ORDINARY WAYS OF BEHAVIOUR AND THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A SMART COSSACK JUST LIKE THE OTHERS BEGAN SPEAKING FLUENTLY IN TARTAR TO THE INTERPRETER
5322-7679-0021 THEY FILLED IN SOME DOCUMENT GAVE IT TO THE SCOUT AND RECEIVED FROM HIM SOME MONEY THEN THEY APPROACHED THE BODY WHICH OF YOU IS LUKE GAVRILOV
5322-7679-0022 I HAVE REPORTED YOUR EXPLOIT TO THE COMMANDER I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL COME OF IT I HAVE RECOMMENDED YOU FOR A CROSS YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE MADE A SERGEANT CAN YOU READ I CAN'T BUT WHAT A FINE FELLOW TO LOOK AT SAID THE CAPTAIN
5322-7679-0023 AGAIN PLAYING THE COMMANDER PUT ON YOUR CAP WHICH OF THE GAVRILOVS DOES HE COME OF THE BROAD EH HIS NEPHEW REPLIED THE CORPORAL
5322-7679-0024 WELL LEND A HAND HELP THEM HE SAID TURNING TO THE COSSACKS LUKASHKA'S FACE SHONE WITH JOY AND SEEMED HANDSOMER THAN USUAL HE MOVED AWAY FROM THE CORPORAL AND HAVING PUT ON HIS CAP SAT DOWN BESIDE OLENIN
5322-7679-0025 WHEN THE BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED TO THE SKIFF THE BROTHER CHECHEN DESCENDED TO THE BANK THE COSSACKS INVOLUNTARILY STEPPED ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS HE JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND PUSHED OFF FROM THE BANK WITH HIS POWERFUL LEG AND NOW
5322-7679-0026 AS OLENIN NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THREW A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THE COSSACKS AND THEN ABRUPTLY ASKED HIS COMPANION A QUESTION THE LATTER ANSWERED SOMETHING AND POINTED TO LUKASHKA
5322-7679-0027 THE CHECHEN LOOKED AT HIM AND TURNING SLOWLY AWAY GAZED AT THE OPPOSITE BANK THAT LOOK EXPRESSED NOT HATRED BUT COLD CONTEMPT HE AGAIN MADE SOME REMARK WHAT IS HE SAYING OLENIN ASKED OF THE FIDGETY SCOUT
5322-7679-0028 YOURS KILL OURS OURS SLAY YOURS IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME REPLIED THE SCOUT EVIDENTLY INVENTING AND HE SMILED SHOWING HIS WHITE TEETH AS HE JUMPED INTO THE SKIFF THE DEAD MAN'S BROTHER SAT MOTIONLESS
5322-7679-0029 GAZING AT THE OPPOSITE BANK HE WAS SO FULL OF HATRED AND CONTEMPT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THAT MOVED HIS CURIOSITY THE SCOUT STANDING UP AT ONE END OF THE SKIFF
5322-7679-0030 AND DIPPING HIS PADDLE NOW ON ONE SIDE NOW ON THE OTHER STEERED SKILFULLY WHILE TALKING INCESSANTLY THE SKIFF BECAME SMALLER AND SMALLER AS IT MOVED OBLIQUELY ACROSS THE STREAM THE VOICES BECAME SCARCELY AUDIBLE
5322-7679-0031 AND AT LAST STILL WITHIN SIGHT THEY LANDED ON THE OPPOSITE BANK WHERE THEIR HORSES STOOD WAITING THERE THEY LIFTED OUT THE CORPSE AND THOUGH THE HORSE SHIED LAID IT ACROSS ONE OF THE SADDLES
5322-7679-0032 MOUNTED AND RODE AT A FOOT PACE ALONG THE ROAD PAST A TARTAR VILLAGE FROM WHICH A CROWD CAME OUT TO LOOK AT THEM THE COSSACKS ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE OF THE RIVER WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED AND JOVIAL LAUGHTER AND JOKES WERE HEARD ON ALL SIDES
5322-7679-0033 THE CAPTAIN AND THE HEAD OF THE VILLAGE ENTERED THE MUD HUT TO REGALE THEMSELVES LUKASHKA VAINLY STRIVING TO IMPART A SEDATE EXPRESSION TO HIS MERRY FACE SAT DOWN WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES BESIDE OLENIN AND WHITTLED AWAY AT A STICK
5322-7679-0034 LOOK THERE NOW THE MOUNTAINS ARE NOT FAR OFF CONTINUED LUKASHKA YET YOU CAN'T GET THERE HOW WILL YOU GET BACK ALONE IT'S GETTING DARK I'LL TAKE YOU IF YOU LIKE YOU ASK THE CORPORAL TO GIVE ME LEAVE WHAT A FINE FELLOW
5322-7679-0035 THOUGHT OLENIN LOOKING AT THE COSSACK'S BRIGHT FACE
5322-7679-0036 CAN IT BE THAT NOTHING TELLS HIM THAT IT IS NOT A REASON FOR ANY REJOICING AND THAT HAPPINESS LIES NOT IN KILLING BUT IN SACRIFICING ONESELF WELL YOU HAD BETTER NOT MEET HIM AGAIN NOW MATE
5322-7679-0037 SAID ONE OF THE COSSACKS WHO HAD SEEN THE SKIFF OFF ADDRESSING LUKASHKA DID YOU HEAR HIM ASKING ABOUT YOU LUKASHKA RAISED HIS HEAD MY GODSON SAID LUKASHKA MEANING BY THAT WORD THE DEAD CHECHEN YOUR GODSON WON'T RISE
5322-7679-0038 BUT THE RED ONE IS THE GODSON'S BROTHER LET HIM THANK GOD THAT HE GOT OFF WHOLE HIMSELF REPLIED LUKASHKA
5322-7680-0000 AND OLENIN TO PLEASE LUKASHKA AS WELL AS TO AVOID GOING BACK ALONE THROUGH THE DARK FOREST ASKED THE CORPORAL TO GIVE LUKASHKA LEAVE AND THE CORPORAL DID SO
5322-7680-0001 OLENIN THOUGHT THAT LUKASHKA WANTED TO SEE MARYANKA AND HE WAS ALSO GLAD OF THE COMPANIONSHIP OF SUCH A PLEASANT LOOKING AND SOCIABLE COSSACK LUKASHKA AND MARYANKA HE INVOLUNTARILY UNITED IN HIS MIND AND HE FOUND PLEASURE IN THINKING ABOUT THEM
5322-7680-0002 HE LOVES MARYANKA THOUGHT OLENIN AND I COULD LOVE HER AND A NEW AND POWERFUL EMOTION OF TENDERNESS OVERCAME HIM AS THEY WALKED HOMEWARDS TOGETHER THROUGH THE DARK FOREST LUKASHKA TOO FELT HAPPY
5322-7680-0003 SOMETHING AKIN TO LOVE MADE ITSELF FELT BETWEEN THESE TWO VERY DIFFERENT YOUNG MEN EVERY TIME THEY GLANCED AT ONE ANOTHER THEY WANTED TO LAUGH BY WHICH GATE DO YOU ENTER ASKED OLENIN
5322-7680-0004 BY THE MIDDLE ONE BUT I'LL SEE YOU AS FAR AS THE MARSH AFTER THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR OLENIN LAUGHED
5322-7680-0005 IT'S ALL RIGHT WHAT HAVE I TO DO AND HOW CAN YOU HELP BEING AFRAID EVEN WE ARE AFRAID SAID LUKASHKA TO SET OLENIN'S SELF ESTEEM AT REST AND HE LAUGHED TOO THEN COME IN WITH ME WE'LL HAVE A TALK AND A DRINK AND IN THE MORNING YOU CAN GO BACK
5322-7680-0006 COULDN'T I FIND A PLACE TO SPEND THE NIGHT LAUGHED LUKASHKA BUT THE CORPORAL ASKED ME TO GO BACK I HEARD YOU SINGING LAST NIGHT AND ALSO SAW YOU EVERY ONE AND LUKE SWAYED HIS HEAD IS IT TRUE YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED ASKED OLENIN

5322-7680-0019 THE OUTLINES OF THE HUTS WERE CLEARLY TO BE SEEN LIGHTS GLEAMED AND THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE PECULIAR SMELL OF KISYAK SMOKE OLENIN FELT KEENLY THAT NIGHT ESPECIALLY THAT HERE IN THIS VILLAGE WAS HIS HOME HIS FAMILY

5322-7680-0030 AND IT WAS LATE WHEN LUKASHKA NOT TIPSY HE NEVER WAS TIPSY BUT HAVING DRUNK A GOOD DEAL LEFT OLENIN AFTER SHAKING HANDS OLENIN LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD DO
5322-7680-0031 LUKASHKA WENT OUT HANGING HIS HEAD THEN HAVING LED THE HORSE OUT OF THE GATE HE SUDDENLY SHOOK HIS HEAD THREW THE REINS OF THE HALTER OVER ITS HEAD SPRANG ONTO ITS BACK LIKE A CAT GAVE A WILD SHOUT AND GALLOPED DOWN THE STREET
5322-7680-0032 BUT THOUGH HE DID NOT DO SO OLENIN STILL FELT HIS SOUL MORE AT EASE THAN EVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HE WAS AS DELIGHTED AS A BOY
5322-7680-0033 AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TELLING VANYUSHA NOT ONLY THAT HE HAD GIVEN LUKASHKA THE HORSE BUT ALSO WHY HE HAD DONE IT AS WELL AS HIS NEW THEORY OF HAPPINESS VANYUSHA DID NOT APPROVE OF HIS THEORY AND ANNOUNCED THAT
196-122159-0000 AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
196-122159-0001 AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
196-122159-0002 LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
196-122159-0003 OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
196-122159-0004 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
196-122159-0005 THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
196-122159-0006 SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
196-122159-0007 GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
196-122159-0008 SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
196-122159-0009 IN NO OTHER KIND OF LIFE IS THE ILLUSION MORE WIDE OF REALITY IN NO OTHER IS THE BEGINNING ALL ILLUSION THE DISENCHANTMENT MORE SWIFT THE SUBJUGATION MORE COMPLETE
196-122159-0010 HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
196-122159-0011 HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
196-122159-0012 AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
196-122159-0013 AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
196-122159-0014 HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
196-122159-0015 AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
196-122159-0016 BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
196-122159-0017 HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
196-122159-0018 HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
196-122159-0019 I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
196-122159-0020 HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
196-122159-0021 I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN I AM I AM A GENTLEMAN TOO YES YES I SAID HASTILY HE WAS LOOKING ME SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND WITHDREW HIS GAZE SLOWLY
196-122159-0022 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
196-122159-0023 MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
196-122159-0024 A HAIR'S BREADTH HE MUTTERED NOT THE BREADTH OF A HAIR BETWEEN THIS AND THAT AND AT THE TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE A HAIR AT MIDNIGHT I PUT IN
196-122159-0025 A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
196-122159-0026 KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
196-122159-0027 HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
196-122159-0028 NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
196-122159-0029 I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
196-122159-0030 I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
196-122159-0031 BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
196-122159-0032 NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
196-122152-0000 HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
196-122152-0001 AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
196-122152-0002 THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
196-122152-0003 AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
196-122152-0004 FOR THE TERRIBLY DISTINCT QUESTIONS THAT EXTORTED HIS ANSWERS SEEMED TO SHAPE THEMSELVES IN ANGUISH AND PAIN WITHIN HIS BREAST CAME TO HIM POIGNANT AND SILENT
196-122152-0005 OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0006 CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
196-122152-0007 AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
196-122152-0008 LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0009 I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
196-122152-0010 HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
196-122152-0011 I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
196-122152-0012 TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
196-122152-0013 HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM AGAIN HE STOOD BENDING OVER HIM AND SPEAKING ANGRILY BUT QUITE LOW
196-122152-0014 STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
196-122152-0015 WHICH WAS ON THE PORT SIDE HE MOANED AS HE RAN HE SPOKE SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED SWIFTLY AND WITH EXTREME VIVIDNESS HE COULD HAVE REPRODUCED LIKE AN ECHO THE MOANING OF THE ENGINEER FOR THE BETTER INFORMATION OF THESE MEN
196-122152-0016 WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
196-122152-0017 THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
196-122152-0018 PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
196-122152-0019 AND FORTUNATELY HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO GO ON TALKING FOR TRUTH'S SAKE PERHAPS FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALSO AND WHILE HIS UTTERANCE WAS DELIBERATE HIS MIND POSITIVELY FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE SERRIED CIRCLE OF FACTS
196-122152-0020 HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
196-122152-0021 FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
196-122152-0022 THE MAGISTRATE HAD SWAYED FORWARD
196-122152-0023 HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
196-122152-0024 AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
196-122152-0025 RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
196-122152-0026 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
196-122152-0027 IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
196-122152-0028 HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
196-122152-0029 LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
196-122152-0030 THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
196-122152-0031 AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
196-122152-0032 HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
196-122152-0033 OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
3486-166446-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
3486-166446-0001 OF HUMAN LIFE OF GREEN LIFE OF LIFE OF ANY KIND THERE WAS NONE
3486-166446-0002 PALACE TEMPLE AND HOME NORHALA HAD STAMPED FLAT SHE HAD CRUSHED THEM WITHIN THE ROCK EVEN AS SHE HAD PROMISED THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED MY EVERY FACULTY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0004 DWELT CURIOUSLY UPON THE RED BRAND ACROSS VENTNOR'S FOREHEAD
3486-166446-0005 BUT IN THE EYES OF RUTH WAS NONE OF THIS STERNLY COLDLY TRIUMPHANT INDIFFERENT TO ITS PITEOUSNESS AS NORHALA HERSELF SHE SCANNED THE WASTE THAT LESS THAN AN HOUR SINCE HAD BEEN A PLACE OF LIVING BEAUTY I FELT A SHOCK OF REPULSION AFTER ALL
3486-166446-0006 YET MOTHER AND BLOSSOMING MAID YOUTH AND OLDSTER ALL THE PAGEANT OF HUMANITY WITHIN THE GREAT WALLS WERE NOW BUT LINES WITHIN THE STONE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT LIGHTS IT CAME TO ME THERE HAD BEEN
3486-166446-0007 FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
3486-166446-0008 THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
3486-166446-0009 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
3486-166446-0010 THEY TORTURED HIM THEY GAVE HIM AGONY UNTIL HE RETURNED AND THEY PROMISED HIM OTHER AGONIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PRAY LONG FOR DEATH AND ME ME SHE RAISED LITTLE CLENCHED HANDS
3486-166446-0011 ME THEY STRIPPED LIKE A SLAVE THEY LED ME THROUGH THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE MOCKED ME
3486-166446-0012 BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
3486-166446-0013 NORHALA GAZED AT HER FROM GREAT GRAY EYES IN WHICH THE WRATH WAS DYING INTO WHICH THE OLD TRANQUILLITY THE OLD SERENITY WAS FLOWING AND WHEN SHE SPOKE THE GOLDEN VOICE HELD MORE THAN RETURNING ECHOES OF THE FAR AWAY FAINT CHIMINGS IT IS DONE SHE SAID
3486-166446-0014 AND IT WAS WELL DONE SISTER NOW YOU AND I SHALL DWELL TOGETHER IN PEACE SISTER OR IF THERE BE THOSE IN THE WORLD FROM WHICH YOU CAME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SLAIN
3486-166446-0015 THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO FORTH WITH OUR COMPANIES AND STAMP THEM OUT EVEN AS I DID THESE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING FOR FROM THE DEPTHS OF RUTH'S EYES SHINING SHADOWS WERE RISING WRAITHS ANSWERING NORHALA'S CALLING
3486-166446-0016 AND AS THEY ROSE STEADILY THEY DREW LIFE FROM THE CLEAR RADIANCE SUMMONING DREW CLOSER TO THE SEMBLANCE OF THAT TRANQUIL SPIRIT WHICH HER VENGEANCE HAD BANISHED
3486-166446-0017 AND AT LAST IT WAS TWIN SISTER OF NORHALA WHO LOOKED UPON HER FROM THE FACE OF RUTH THE WHITE ARMS OF THE WOMAN ENCIRCLED HER THE GLORIOUS HEAD BENT OVER HER FLAMING TRESSES MINGLED WITH TENDER BROWN CURLS
3486-166446-0018 SISTER SHE WHISPERED LITTLE SISTER THESE MEN YOU SHALL HAVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASES YOU TO DO WITH AS YOU WILL OR IF IT IS YOUR WISH THEY SHALL GO BACK TO THEIR WORLD AND I WILL GUARD THEM TO ITS GATES
3486-166446-0019 BUT YOU AND I LITTLE SISTER WILL DWELL TOGETHER IN THE VASTNESSES IN THE PEACE SHALL IT NOT BE SO WITH NO FALTERING WITH NO GLANCE TOWARD US THREE
3486-166446-0020 LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
3486-166446-0021 AN ECSTASY OF TENDERNESS A FLAME OF UNEARTHLY RAPTURE TREMBLED OVER THE WOMAN'S WONDROUS FACE HUNGRILY DEFIANTLY SHE PRESSED THE GIRL TO HER THE STARS IN THE LUCID HEAVENS OF HER EYES WERE SOFT AND GENTLE AND CARESSING
3486-166446-0022 RUTH CRIED DRAKE AND SPRANG TOWARD THEM SHE PAID NO HEED AND EVEN AS HE LEAPED HE WAS CAUGHT WHIRLED BACK AGAINST US WAIT SAID VENTNOR
3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0025 LIKE METAL WAVES BACK INTO IT RUSHED THE ENIGMATIC BILLOWS THAT HAD WASHED OVER THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CITY WE WERE LIFTED BETWEEN US AND THE WOMAN AND GIRL A CLEFT APPEARED IT WIDENED INTO A RIFT
3486-166446-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH NORHALA HAD DECREED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THIS HER SECOND VICTORY OR HAD SET IT BETWEEN US AS A BARRIER WIDER GREW THE RIFT
3486-166446-0027 SAVE FOR THE BRIDGE OF OUR VOICES IT SEPARATED US FROM RUTH AS THOUGH SHE STOOD UPON ANOTHER WORLD HIGHER WE ROSE THE THREE OF US NOW UPON THE FLAT TOP OF A TOWER UPON WHOSE COUNTERPART FIFTY FEET AWAY
3486-166446-0028 QUIETLY IT GLIDED TO THE CHASM IT HAD BLASTED IN THE CLIFF WALL THE SHADOW OF THOSE WALLS FELL UPON US AS ONE WE LOOKED BACK AS ONE WE SEARCHED OUT THE PATCH OF BLUE WITH THE BLACK BLOT AT ITS BREAST WE FOUND IT THEN THE PRECIPICES HID IT
3486-166446-0029 SILENTLY WE STREAMED THROUGH THE CHASM THROUGH THE CANYON AND THE TUNNEL SPEAKING NO WORD DRAKE'S EYES FIXED WITH BITTER HATRED UPON NORHALA VENTNOR BROODING UPON HER ALWAYS WITH THAT ENIGMATIC SYMPATHY WE PASSED BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE FURTHER CLEFT
3486-166446-0030 STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
3486-166446-0031 THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
3486-166446-0032 PURGED NOT ONLY BY SUFFERING BUT BY IT CAME TO ME SOME STRANGE KNOWLEDGE NO USE DRAKE HE SAID DREAMILY
3486-166446-0033 BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3486-166446-0034 IT IS THE CRISIS HE ANSWERED WE CAN DO NOTHING GOODWIN NOTHING WHATEVER IS TO BE STEPS FORTH NOW FROM THE WOMB OF DESTINY AGAIN THERE CAME THAT DISTANT ROLLING LOUDER NOW AGAIN THE THING TREMBLED
3486-166446-0035 IS IT TAPS FOR THEM THE DRUMMING DIED AS I LISTENED FEARFULLY ABOUT US WAS ONLY THE SWISHING THE SIGHING OF THE FALLING TREES BENEATH THE TREAD OF THE THING MOTIONLESS STOOD NORHALA
3486-166446-0036 AND AS MOTIONLESS RUTH MARTIN I CRIED ONCE MORE A DREADFUL DOUBT UPON ME MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHENCE DID THEY COME HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR AND CALM THE EYES BENEATH
3486-166446-0037 THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3486-166446-0039 AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
3486-166446-0040 REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
3486-166446-0041 IN IT SOMETHING OMINOUS SOMETHING SINISTER IT SWELLED TO A CRESCENDO ABRUPTLY CEASED AND NOW I SAW NORHALA RAISE HER HEAD LISTEN I SAW A WORLD A VAST WORLD GOODWIN MARCHING STATELY THROUGH SPACE
3486-166446-0042 IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
3486-166446-0043 A GEOMETRIC THOUGHT OF THE GREAT CAUSE OF GOD IF YOU WILL MADE MATERIAL IT WAS AIRLESS WATERLESS SUNLESS
6181-216552-0000 POTHIER SEEMS TO THINK THAT PROPERTY LIKE ROYALTY EXISTS BY DIVINE RIGHT HE TRACES BACK ITS ORIGIN TO GOD HIMSELF
6181-216552-0001 PRINCIPIUM HE BEGINS IN THIS WAY GOD IS THE ABSOLUTE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THAT IT CONTAINS DOMINI
6181-216552-0002 FOR THE HUMAN RACE HE HAS CREATED THE EARTH AND ALL ITS CREATURES AND HAS GIVEN IT A CONTROL OVER THEM SUBORDINATE ONLY TO HIS OWN THOU MADEST HIM TO HAVE DOMINION OVER THE WORKS OF THY HANDS
6181-216552-0003 THOU HAST PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET SAYS THE PSALMIST GOD ACCOMPANIED THIS GIFT WITH THESE WORDS ADDRESSED TO OUR FIRST PARENTS AFTER THE CREATION BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY
6181-216552-0004 ARE FATHERS UNNATURAL AND CHILDREN PRODIGAL GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE WHY THEN HAVE I RECEIVED NONE HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET
6181-216552-0005 AND I HAVE NOT WHERE TO LAY MY HEAD MULTIPLY HE TELLS US THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER POTHIER AH LEARNED POTHIER THAT IS AS EASY TO DO AS TO SAY
6181-216552-0006 BUT YOU MUST GIVE MOSS TO THE BIRD FOR ITS NEST THE HUMAN RACE HAVING MULTIPLIED MEN DIVIDED AMONG THEMSELVES THE EARTH AND MOST OF THE THINGS UPON IT THAT WHICH FELL TO EACH
6181-216552-0007 FROM THAT TIME EXCLUSIVELY BELONGED TO HIM THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY SAY RATHER THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION MEN LIVED IN A STATE OF COMMUNISM
6181-216552-0008 WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT MATTERS LITTLE THEN THERE WAS NO PROPERTY NOT EVEN PRIVATE POSSESSION THE GENESIS AND GROWTH OF POSSESSION GRADUALLY FORCING PEOPLE TO LABOR FOR THEIR SUPPORT
6181-216552-0009 THEY AGREED EITHER FORMALLY OR TACITLY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHICH THAT THE LABORER SHOULD BE SOLE PROPRIETOR OF THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR THAT IS THEY SIMPLY DECLARED THE FACT
6181-216552-0010 THAT THEREAFTER NONE COULD LIVE WITHOUT WORKING IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWED THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF PRODUCTS THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF LABOR AND THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF LABOR
6181-216552-0011 THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF FACILITIES FOR LABOR WHOEVER WITHOUT LABOR GOT POSSESSION BY FORCE OR BY STRATEGY OF ANOTHER'S MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE DESTROYED EQUALITY
6181-216552-0012 WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
6181-216552-0013 BUT IN WHAT THING EVIDENTLY IN THE PRODUCT NOT IN THE SOIL SO THE ARABS HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IT AND SO ACCORDING TO CAESAR AND TACITUS THE GERMANS FORMERLY HELD THE ARABS
6181-216552-0014 WHO ADMIT A MAN'S PROPERTY IN THE FLOCKS WHICH HE HAS RAISED DO NOT REFUSE THE CROP TO HIM WHO PLANTED THE SEED BUT THEY DO NOT SEE WHY ANOTHER HIS EQUAL SHOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO PLANT IN HIS TURN
6181-216552-0015 THE INEQUALITY WHICH RESULTS FROM THE PRETENDED RIGHT OF THE FIRST OCCUPANT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE BASED ON NO PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE AND WHEN ALL THE LAND FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INHABITANTS
6181-216552-0016 THERE RESULTS A MONOPOLY IN THEIR FAVOR AGAINST THE REST OF THE NATION TO WHICH THEY DO NOT WISH TO SUBMIT WELL THEY HAVE SHARED THE LAND
6181-216552-0017 AND THAT THIS METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION FIXED AND DURABLE IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO PRODUCTION BUT HOW COULD THIS DIVISION GIVE TO EACH A TRANSFERABLE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A THING TO WHICH
6181-216552-0018 ALL HAD AN INALIENABLE RIGHT OF POSSESSION
6181-216552-0019 THIS METAMORPHOSIS FROM POSSESSOR TO PROPRIETOR IS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE IT IMPLIES IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS THE UNION OF POSSESSOIRE AND PETITOIRE
6181-216552-0020 AND THE MUTUAL CONCESSIONS OF THOSE WHO SHARE THE LAND ARE NOTHING LESS THAN TRAFFIC IN NATURAL RIGHTS THE ORIGINAL CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND WHO WERE ALSO THE ORIGINAL MAKERS OF THE LAW WERE NOT AS LEARNED
6181-216552-0021 INTO THE RIGHT OF ABSOLUTE PROPERTY BUT WHY HAVE NOT THOSE WHO IN LATER TIMES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN JUS IN RE AND JUS AD REM
6181-216552-0022 APPLIED IT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPERTY ITSELF LET ME CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE WRITERS ON JURISPRUDENCE TO THEIR OWN MAXIMS THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY PROVIDED IT CAN HAVE A CAUSE CAN HAVE BUT ONE
6181-216552-0023 DOMINIUM NON POTEST NISI EX UNA CAUSA
6181-216552-0024 I CAN POSSESS BY SEVERAL TITLES I CAN BECOME PROPRIETOR BY ONLY ONE
6181-216552-0025 TO ME AS MY SHARE BUT NONE OF THESE TITLES CONFER UPON ME THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY FOR IF I ATTEMPT TO BASE IT UPON OCCUPANCY SOCIETY CAN REPLY
6181-216552-0026 I AM THE ORIGINAL OCCUPANT IF I APPEAL TO MY LABOR IT WILL SAY IT IS ONLY ON THAT CONDITION THAT YOU POSSESS IF I SPEAK OF AGREEMENTS IT WILL RESPOND
6181-216552-0027 THESE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH ONLY YOUR RIGHT OF USE SUCH HOWEVER ARE THE ONLY TITLES WHICH PROPRIETORS ADVANCE THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER ANY OTHERS INDEED EVERY RIGHT
6181-216552-0028 IT IS POTHIER WHO SAYS IT SUPPOSES A PRODUCING CAUSE IN THE PERSON WHO ENJOYS IT
6181-216552-0029 IN THIS SON OF EARTH WHO PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW THERE EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO EXTERNAL THINGS ONLY TITLES OF POSSESSION NOT ONE TITLE OF PROPERTY WHY THEN
6181-216552-0030 HAS SOCIETY RECOGNIZED A RIGHT INJURIOUS TO ITSELF WHERE THERE IS NO PRODUCING CAUSE WHY IN ACCORDING POSSESSION HAS IT ALSO CONCEDED PROPERTY WHY HAS THE LAW SANCTIONED THIS ABUSE OF POWER
6181-216552-0031 SOME PHILOSOPHERS PRETEND THAT MAN IN EMPLOYING HIS FORCES UPON A NATURAL OBJECT SAY A FIELD OR A TREE ACQUIRES A RIGHT ONLY TO THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HE MAKES
6181-216552-0032 TO THE FORM WHICH HE GIVES TO THE OBJECT NOT TO THE OBJECT ITSELF USELESS DISTINCTION IF THE FORM COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR QUESTION
6181-216552-0033 BUT AS THIS IS ALMOST ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE THE APPLICATION OF MAN'S STRENGTH TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VISIBLE WORLD IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY THE PRIMARY ORIGIN OF RICHES
6181-216552-0034 VAIN PRETEXT IF THE FORM CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT NOR PROPERTY FROM POSSESSION POSSESSION MUST BE SHARED IN ANY CASE
6181-216552-0035 SOCIETY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO FIX THE CONDITIONS OF PROPERTY LET US SUPPOSE THAT AN APPROPRIATED FARM YIELDS A GROSS INCOME OF TEN THOUSAND FRANCS AND AS VERY SELDOM HAPPENS
6181-216552-0036 THE POSSESSOR OF THIS FARM SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO GUARD HIS REPUTATION AS A GOOD FATHER OF A FAMILY BY PAYING TO SOCIETY TEN THOUSAND FRANCS LESS THE TOTAL COSTS OF CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0037 AND THE THREE THOUSAND FRANCS REQUIRED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HIS FAMILY THIS PAYMENT IS NOT RENT IT IS AN INDEMNITY WHAT SORT OF JUSTICE IS IT THEN WHICH MAKES SUCH LAWS AS THIS
6181-216552-0038 WHEREAS SINCE LABOR SO CHANGES THE FORM OF A THING THAT THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE SEPARATED WITHOUT DESTROYING THE THING ITSELF EITHER SOCIETY MUST BE DISINHERITED
6181-216552-0039 OR THE LABORER MUST LOSE THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND WHEREAS IN EVERY OTHER CASE PROPERTY IN RAW MATERIAL WOULD GIVE A TITLE TO ADDED IMPROVEMENTS MINUS THEIR COST
6181-216552-0040 AND WHEREAS IN THIS INSTANCE PROPERTY IN IMPROVEMENTS OUGHT TO GIVE A TITLE TO THE PRINCIPAL
6181-216552-0041 SHALL NEVER BE ADMITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS BUT ONLY AGAINST SOCIETY IN SUCH A WAY DO LEGISLATORS ALWAYS REASON IN REGARD TO PROPERTY
6181-216552-0042 THE LAW IS INTENDED TO PROTECT MEN'S MUTUAL RIGHTS THAT IS THE RIGHTS OF EACH AGAINST EACH AND EACH AGAINST ALL
6181-216552-0043 THE LAW MAKERS ALWAYS DISREGARD THE LATTER AS LONG AS MAN IS OPPOSED TO MAN PROPERTY OFFSETS PROPERTY AND THE TWO FORCES BALANCE EACH OTHER AS SOON AS MAN IS ISOLATED
6181-216552-0044 THAT IS OPPOSED TO THE SOCIETY WHICH HE HIMSELF REPRESENTS JURISPRUDENCE IS AT FAULT THEMIS HAS LOST ONE SCALE OF HER BALANCE LISTEN TO THE PROFESSOR OF RENNES THE LEARNED TOULLIER
6181-216552-0045 POSSESSION AGRICULTURE WAS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE AND AGRICULTURE IN ITS TURN FAVORS POPULATION AND NECESSITATES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT PROPERTY
6181-216552-0046 FOR WHO WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PLOUGH AND SOW IF HE WERE NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REAP TO SATISFY THE HUSBANDMAN IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO GUARANTEE HIM POSSESSION OF HIS CROP ADMIT EVEN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
6181-216552-0047 PROTECTED IN HIS RIGHT OF OCCUPATION OF LAND AS LONG AS HE REMAINED ITS CULTIVATOR THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT WAS ALL THAT THE ADVANCE OF CIVILIZATION DEMANDED
6181-216552-0048 BUT PROPERTY PROPERTY THE RIGHT OF ESCHEAT OVER LANDS WHICH ONE NEITHER OCCUPIES NOR CULTIVATES
6181-216552-0049 WHO PRETENDED TO HAVE IT AGRICULTURE ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT PROPERTY POSITIVE LAWS WERE NEEDED AND MAGISTRATES TO EXECUTE THEM IN A WORD
6181-216552-0050 THE CIVIL STATE WAS NEEDED THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE HAD RENDERED AGRICULTURE NECESSARY THE NEED OF SECURING TO THE CULTIVATOR THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR MADE PERMANENT PROPERTY NECESSARY
6181-216552-0051 AND ALSO LAWS FOR ITS PROTECTION SO WE ARE INDEBTED TO PROPERTY FOR THE CREATION OF THE CIVIL STATE
6181-216552-0052 A STATE WHICH AT FIRST WAS DESPOTISM THEN MONARCHY THEN ARISTOCRACY TODAY DEMOCRACY AND ALWAYS TYRANNY WITHOUT THE TIES OF PROPERTY IT NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
6181-216552-0053 TO SUBORDINATE MEN TO THE WHOLESOME YOKE OF THE LAW AND WITHOUT PERMANENT PROPERTY THE EARTH WOULD HAVE REMAINED A VAST FOREST LET US ADMIT THEN
6181-216552-0054 IT IS THE CIVIL LAW WHICH HOLDS THAT WHEN ONCE ACQUIRED PROPERTY CAN BE LOST ONLY BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR AND THAT IT EXISTS EVEN AFTER THE PROPRIETOR HAS RELINQUISHED POSSESSION OF THE THING
6181-216552-0055 AND IT HAS FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY THUS PROPERTY AND POSSESSION WHICH ORIGINALLY WERE CONFOUNDED BECAME THROUGH THE CIVIL LAW TWO DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT THINGS TWO THINGS WHICH IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW
6181-216552-0056 HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER IN COMMON IN THIS WE SEE WHAT A WONDERFUL CHANGE HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN PROPERTY AND TO WHAT AN EXTENT NATURE HAS BEEN ALTERED BY THE CIVIL LAWS THUS THE LAW IN ESTABLISHING PROPERTY
6181-216552-0057 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATURAL LAW THE APPLICATION OF A MORAL PRINCIPLE IT HAS LITERALLY CREATED A RIGHT OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN PROVINCE IT HAS REALIZED AN ABSTRACTION A METAPHOR
6181-216552-0058 IT HAS INDORSED MONSTROUS PRETENSIONS IT HAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOR IMPIOUS VOWS AS IF IT WERE ABLE TO FILL UP A BOTTOMLESS PIT
6181-216552-0059 BLIND LAW THE LAW OF THE IGNORANT MAN A LAW WHICH IS NOT A LAW THE VOICE OF DISCORD DECEIT AND BLOOD THIS IT IS WHICH CONTINUALLY REVIVED REINSTATED REJUVENATED
6181-216552-0060 RESTORED RE ENFORCED AS THE PALLADIUM OF SOCIETY HAS TROUBLED THE CONSCIENCES OF THE PEOPLE HAS OBSCURED THE MINDS OF THE MASTERS AND HAS INDUCED ALL THE CATASTROPHES
6181-216552-0061 THIS IT IS WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAS CONDEMNED BUT WHICH ITS IGNORANT MINISTERS DEIFY WHO HAVE AS LITTLE DESIRE TO STUDY NATURE AND MAN AS ABILITY TO READ THEIR SCRIPTURES
6181-216552-0062 BUT INDEED WHAT GUIDE DID THE LAW FOLLOW IN CREATING THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY WHAT PRINCIPLE DIRECTED IT WHAT WAS ITS STANDARD WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IT WAS EQUALITY
6181-216552-0063 UNLESS THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION WERE AT THE SAME TIME SECURED TO HIM TO FORTIFY THE WEAK AGAINST THE INVASION OF THE STRONG TO SUPPRESS SPOLIATION AND FRAUD
6181-216552-0064 AND THE CUPIDITY OF THE HUSBANDMAN INCREASE IT WAS THOUGHT BEST TO PUT A BRIDLE ON AMBITION BY SETTING BOUNDARIES WHICH AMBITION WOULD IN VAIN ATTEMPT TO OVERSTEP
6181-216552-0065 A MULTITUDE OF RIGHTS SOME FOUNDED IN NATURE BUT WRONGLY INTERPRETED AND STILL MORE WRONGLY APPLIED INHERITANCE GIFT AND EXCHANGE OTHERS LIKE THE PRIVILEGES OF BIRTH AND POSITION
6181-216552-0066 FOR THE BARBARIANS INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN ANNUAL QUARRELS AND FIGHTS INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY MOVING THEIR HOUSES FURNITURE AND FAMILIES FROM SPOT TO SPOT THAN TO ASSIGN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL A FIXED AND INALIENABLE ESTATE
6181-216552-0067 IT WAS NOT RIGHT THAT THE SOLDIER ON RETURNING FROM AN EXPEDITION SHOULD FIND HIMSELF DISPOSSESSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE SERVICES WHICH HE HAD JUST RENDERED TO HIS COUNTRY
6181-216552-0068 AND BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE EQUALITY IN THE DIVISION SHOULD BE KEPT UP FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER WITHOUT A NEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND UPON THE DEATH OF EACH FAMILY
6181-216552-0069 THE FEUDAL AND PATRIARCHAL CUSTOM OF RECOGNIZING ONLY ONE HEIR THEN BY A QUITE CONTRARY APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY THE ADMISSION OF ALL THE CHILDREN TO A SHARE IN THEIR FATHER'S ESTATE
6181-216552-0070 WHO NEVER HAD THE FAINTEST IDEA OF STATISTICS VALUATION OR POLITICAL ECONOMY FURNISH US WITH PRINCIPLES OF LEGISLATION THE LAW SAYS A MODERN WRITER ON JURISPRUDENCE
6181-216552-0071 BY WHICH SOCIAL WANTS MUST BE SATISFIED THE PEOPLE DO NOT VOTE IT THE LEGISLATOR DOES NOT EXPRESS IT THE SAVANT DISCOVERS AND FORMULATES IT BUT IN FACT THE LAW
6181-216552-0072 WAS IN THE BEGINNING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF A WANT AND THE INDICATION OF THE MEANS OF SUPPLYING IT AND UP TO THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN NOTHING ELSE THE LEGISTS WITH MECHANICAL FIDELITY
6181-216552-0073 FULL OF OBSTINACY ENEMIES OF PHILOSOPHY BURIED IN LITERALITIES
6181-216552-0074 TO BE SURE WERE WELL MEANING BUT WANTING IN FORESIGHT THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE OLD FOUNDERS OF THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY THAT THE PERPETUAL AND ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO RETAIN ONE'S ESTATE A RIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO THEM
6181-216552-0075 EQUITABLE BECAUSE IT WAS COMMON INVOLVES THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER SELL GIVE GAIN AND LOSE IT THAT IT TENDS CONSEQUENTLY TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT EQUALITY
6181-216552-0076 THEY DISREGARDED IT THE PRESENT WANT OCCUPIED THEIR WHOLE ATTENTION AND AS ORDINARILY HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES THE DISADVANTAGES WERE AT FIRST SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND THEY PASSED UNNOTICED
6181-216552-0077 THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE INGENUOUS LEGISLATORS THAT IF PROPERTY IS RETAINABLE BY INTENT ALONE NUDO ANIMO
6181-216552-0078 IT CARRIES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO LET TO LEASE TO LOAN AT INTEREST TO PROFIT BY EXCHANGE TO SETTLE ANNUITIES AND TO LEVY A TAX ON A FIELD WHICH INTENT RESERVES
6181-216552-0079 WHILE THE BODY IS BUSY ELSEWHERE THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE FATHERS OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE THAT IF THE RIGHT OF INHERITANCE IS ANY THING OTHER THAN NATURE'S METHOD OF PRESERVING EQUALITY OF WEALTH
6181-216552-0080 FAMILIES WILL SOON BECOME VICTIMS OF THE MOST DISASTROUS EXCLUSIONS AND SOCIETY
6181-216552-0081 WILL COME TO ITS DEATH THROUGH OPULENCE
6181-216552-0082 THAT IS THAT INHERITANCE AND SUCCESSION WILL LAST FOR EVER WHOEVER MAY BE THE RECOGNIZED HEIR BUT THE SAINT SIMONIANS WISH THE HEIR TO BE DESIGNATED BY THE MAGISTRATE
6181-216552-0083 OTHERS WISH HIM TO BE CHOSEN BY THE DECEASED OR ASSUMED BY THE LAW TO BE SO CHOSEN
6181-216552-0084 TO DAY THE REAL CONTROLLER OF INHERITANCE IS CHANCE OR CAPRICE NOW IN MATTERS OF LEGISLATION CHANCE AND CAPRICE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS GUIDES
6181-216552-0085 IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING THE MANIFOLD DISTURBANCES WHICH FOLLOW IN THE WAKE OF CHANCE THAT NATURE AFTER HAVING CREATED US EQUAL SUGGESTS TO US THE PRINCIPLE OF HEREDITY
6181-216552-0086 WHICH SERVES AS A VOICE BY WHICH SOCIETY ASKS US TO CHOOSE FROM AMONG ALL OUR BROTHERS HIM WHOM WE JUDGE BEST FITTED TO COMPLETE OUR UNFINISHED WORK THEY DID NOT FORESEE
6181-216552-0087 BUT WHY NEED I GO FARTHER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PLAIN ENOUGH AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO CRITICISE THE WHOLE CODE THE HISTORY OF PROPERTY AMONG THE ANCIENT NATIONS IS THEN
6181-216552-0088 SIMPLY A MATTER OF RESEARCH AND CURIOSITY IT IS A RULE OF JURISPRUDENCE THAT THE FACT DOES NOT SUBSTANTIATE THE RIGHT NOW PROPERTY IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE
6181-216552-0089 THEN THE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY DOES NOT LEGITIMATE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY MAN IS MISTAKEN AS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY THE NATURE OF RIGHT
6181-216552-0090 OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE IS IT TO US THAT THE INDIAN RACE WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR CLASSES THAT ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE AND THE GANGES BLOOD AND POSITION FORMERLY DETERMINED
6181-216552-0091 THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS PLACED PROPERTY UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GODS THAT THEY ACCOMPANIED WITH RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES THE WORK OF PARTITIONING THE LAND AND APPRAISING THEIR GOODS
6181-216552-0092 THE VARIETY OF THE FORMS OF PRIVILEGE DOES NOT SANCTION INJUSTICE THE FAITH OF JUPITER
6181-216552-0093 THAN DO THE MYSTERIES OF VENUS THE WANTON AGAINST CONJUGAL CHASTITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS OF NO EFFECT AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY BECAUSE THIS RIGHT
6181-216552-0094 RESTING OF NECESSITY UPON EQUALITY CONTRADICTS ITS PRINCIPLE THE DECISION OF THE RELIGIONS WHICH HAVE SANCTIONED IT IS OF NO EFFECT BECAUSE IN ALL AGES THE PRIEST HAS SUBMITTED TO THE PRINCE
6181-216552-0095 THE SOCIAL ADVANTAGES ATTRIBUTED TO PROPERTY CANNOT BE CITED IN ITS BEHALF BECAUSE THEY ALL SPRING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF POSSESSION WHAT MEANS THEN THIS DITHYRAMB UPON PROPERTY
6181-216552-0096 THE SHELTER OF HIS FAMILY IN A WORD THE CORNER STONE OF THE DOMESTIC DWELLING OF COMMUNITIES AND OF THE POLITICAL STATE POSSESSION ALONE PRODUCED ALL THAT
6181-216552-0097 ETERNAL PRINCIPLE PROPERTY IS ETERNAL LIKE EVERY NEGATION OF ALL SOCIAL AND CIVIL INSTITUTIONS FOR THAT REASON
6181-216552-0098 EVERY INSTITUTION AND EVERY LAW BASED ON PROPERTY WILL PERISH IT IS A BOON AS PRECIOUS AS LIBERTY FOR THE RICH PROPRIETOR IN FACT THE CAUSE OF THE CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0099 OF THE HABITABLE EARTH IF THE CULTIVATOR CEASED TO BE A TENANT WOULD THE LAND BE WORSE CARED FOR THE GUARANTEE AND THE MORALITY OF LABOR UNDER THE REGIME OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0100 LABOR IS NOT A CONDITION BUT A PRIVILEGE THE APPLICATION OF JUSTICE WHAT IS JUSTICE WITHOUT EQUALITY OF FORTUNES A BALANCE WITH FALSE WEIGHTS
6181-216552-0101 ALL MORALITY A FAMISHED STOMACH KNOWS NO MORALITY ALL PUBLIC ORDER CERTAINLY THE PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0102 STUMBLING BLOCK OF ALL WHICH OUGHT TO BE SUCH IS PROPERTY TO SUM UP AND CONCLUDE NOT ONLY DOES OCCUPATION LEAD TO EQUALITY IT PREVENTS PROPERTY
6181-216552-0103 FOR SINCE EVERY MAN FROM THE FACT OF HIS EXISTENCE HAS THE RIGHT OF OCCUPATION AND IN ORDER TO LIVE MUST HAVE MATERIAL FOR CULTIVATION ON WHICH HE MAY LABOR AND SINCE
6181-216552-0104 ON THE OTHER HAND THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS VARIES CONTINUALLY WITH THE BIRTHS AND DEATHS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE QUANTITY
6181-216552-0105 OF MATERIAL WHICH EACH LABORER MAY CLAIM VARIES WITH THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS CONSEQUENTLY THAT OCCUPATION IS ALWAYS SUBORDINATE TO POPULATION FINALLY THAT INASMUCH AS POSSESSION
6181-216552-0106 IN RIGHT CAN NEVER REMAIN FIXED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN FACT THAT IT CAN EVER BECOME PROPERTY EVERY OCCUPANT IS THEN NECESSARILY A POSSESSOR
6181-216552-0107 HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THING ENTRUSTED TO HIM HE MUST USE IT IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERAL UTILITY WITH A VIEW TO ITS PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT HE HAS NO POWER TO TRANSFORM IT
6181-216552-0108 TO DIMINISH IT OR TO CHANGE ITS NATURE HE CANNOT SO DIVIDE THE USUFRUCT THAT ANOTHER SHALL PERFORM THE LABOR WHILE HE RECEIVES THE PRODUCT IN A WORD
6181-216552-0109 AN IMMORALITY BORN OF VIOLENCE THE MOST MONSTROUS PRETENSION THAT THE CIVIL LAWS EVER SANCTIONED MAN RECEIVES HIS USUFRUCT FROM THE HANDS OF SOCIETY
6181-216552-0110 WHICH ALONE IS THE PERMANENT POSSESSOR THE INDIVIDUAL PASSES AWAY SOCIETY IS DEATHLESS WHAT A PROFOUND DISGUST FILLS MY SOUL WHILE DISCUSSING SUCH SIMPLE TRUTHS
6181-216552-0111 THE AMOUNT OCCUPIED BEING MEASURED NOT BY THE WILL BUT BY THE VARIABLE CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND NUMBER PROPERTY CANNOT EXIST
6181-216552-0112 THIS NO CODE HAS EVER EXPRESSED THIS NO CONSTITUTION CAN ADMIT THESE ARE AXIOMS WHICH THE CIVIL LAW AND THE LAW OF NATIONS DENY
6181-216552-0113 BUT I HEAR THE EXCLAMATIONS OF THE PARTISANS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM LABOR LABOR THAT IS THE BASIS OF PROPERTY READER DO NOT BE DECEIVED
2092-145709-0000 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0001 ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE PALACE IN WHICH THEY LIVED THERE STOOD A CASTLE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED AND ALMOST A RUIN BUT THE GARDEN WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS A MASS OF BLOOMING FLOWERS
2092-145709-0002 AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
2092-145709-0003 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0004 BUT AN ENCHANTED PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN DOOMED TO SPEND HIS YOUTH IN MISERY IF YOU ONLY LIKED PRINCESS YOU COULD SAVE ME BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ALL YOUR OWN PEOPLE
2092-145709-0005 AND COME AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION IN THIS RUINED CASTLE THERE IS ONE HABITABLE ROOM IN IT IN WHICH THERE IS A GOLDEN BED THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE ALL BY YOURSELF
2092-145709-0006 AND DON'T FORGET THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY SEE OR HEAR IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST NOT SCREAM OUT FOR IF YOU GIVE AS MUCH AS A SINGLE CRY MY SUFFERINGS WILL BE DOUBLED
2092-145709-0007 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0008 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED SHE LAY DOWN BUT THOUGH SHE SHUT HER EYES TIGHT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AT MIDNIGHT SHE HEARD TO HER GREAT HORROR SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND IN A MINUTE
2092-145709-0009 HER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE OPEN AND A TROOP OF STRANGE BEINGS ENTERED THE ROOM THEY AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE HUGE FIREPLACE THEN THEY PLACED A GREAT CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER ON IT
2092-145709-0010 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0011 BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A SOUND THEN OF A SUDDEN THE COCK CREW AND ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS VANISHED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CROW APPEARED AND HOPPED ALL ROUND THE ROOM WITH JOY
2092-145709-0012 IT THANKED THE PRINCESS MOST HEARTILY FOR HER GOODNESS AND SAID THAT ITS SUFFERINGS HAD ALREADY BEEN GREATLY LESSENED NOW ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S ELDER SISTERS WHO WAS VERY INQUISITIVE
2092-145709-0013 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0014 INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
2092-145709-0015 THE CROW CAME AND THANKED HER FOR HER ENDURANCE AND ASSURED HER THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE FAR LESS THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND SO TWO YEARS PASSED AWAY WHEN ONE DAY THE CROW CAME TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0017 AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BELONGINGS OF MY FOREFATHERS YOU MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TAKE SERVICE AS A MAIDSERVANT THE YOUNG PRINCESS CONSENTED AT ONCE AND FOR A WHOLE YEAR
2092-145709-0018 AND HAD WORKED HER LITTLE WHITE HANDS WEARY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING BESIDE HER AND A CRY OF JOY THEN SHE SAW A HANDSOME YOUTH STANDING BESIDE HER WHO KNELT DOWN AT HER FEET
2092-145709-0019 AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
2092-145709-0020 COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
3664-178355-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN CHAMPION BUFFALO KILLER SHORTLY AFTER THE ADVENTURES MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I HAD MY CELEBRATED BUFFALO HUNT WITH BILLY COMSTOCK A NOTED SCOUT GUIDE AND INTERPRETER
3664-178355-0001 WHO WAS THEN CHIEF OF SCOUTS AT FORT WALLACE KANSAS COMSTOCK HAD THE REPUTATION FOR A LONG TIME OF BEING A MOST SUCCESSFUL BUFFALO HUNTER AND THE OFFICERS IN PARTICULAR WHO HAD SEEN HIM KILL BUFFALOES WERE VERY DESIROUS OF BACKING HIM IN A MATCH AGAINST ME
3664-178355-0002 IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD SHOOT HIM A BUFFALO KILLING MATCH AND THE PRELIMINARIES WERE EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY AGREED UPON WE WERE TO HUNT ONE DAY OF EIGHT HOURS BEGINNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CLOSING AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3664-178355-0003 THE WAGER WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SIDE AND THE MAN WHO SHOULD KILL THE GREATER NUMBER OF BUFFALOES FROM ON HORSEBACK WAS TO BE DECLARED THE WINNER THE HUNT TOOK PLACE ABOUT TWENTY MILES EAST OF SHERIDAN AND AS IT HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED AND NOISED ABROAD
3664-178355-0004 A LARGE CROWD WITNESSED THE INTERESTING AND EXCITING SCENE AN EXCURSION PARTY MOSTLY FROM SAINT LOUIS CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CAME OUT ON A SPECIAL TRAIN TO VIEW THE SPORT AND AMONG THE NUMBER WAS MY WIFE WITH LITTLE BABY ARTA
3664-178355-0005 THE BUFFALOES WERE QUITE PLENTY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SAME HERD AT THE SAME TIME AND MAKE A RUN AS WE CALLED IT EACH ONE KILLING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE A REFEREE WAS TO FOLLOW EACH OF US ON HORSEBACK WHEN WE ENTERED THE HERD AND COUNT THE BUFFALOES KILLED BY EACH MAN
3664-178355-0006 WHEN THEY WERE TO COME UP AS NEAR AS THEY PLEASED AND WITNESS THE CHASE WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST RUN IN GETTING GOOD GROUND COMSTOCK WAS MOUNTED ON ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HORSES WHILE I RODE OLD BRIGHAM I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF COMSTOCK IN TWO THINGS
3664-178355-0007 FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
3664-178355-0008 WHILE COMSTOCK WAS ARMED WITH A HENRY RIFLE AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD FIRE A FEW SHOTS QUICKER THAN I COULD YET I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT DID NOT CARRY POWDER AND LEAD ENOUGH TO DO EXECUTION EQUAL TO MY CALIBRE FIFTY AT LAST THE TIME CAME TO BEGIN THE MATCH
3664-178355-0009 COMSTOCK AND I DASHED INTO A HERD FOLLOWED BY THE REFEREES THE BUFFALOES SEPARATED COMSTOCK TOOK THE LEFT BUNCH AND I THE RIGHT MY GREAT FORTE IN KILLING BUFFALOES FROM HORSEBACK WAS TO GET THEM CIRCLING BY RIDING MY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE HERD SHOOTING THE LEADERS
3664-178355-0010 TILL THEY WOULD FINALLY CIRCLE ROUND AND ROUND ON THIS MORNING THE BUFFALOES WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING
3664-178355-0011 I HAD NURSED MY BUFFALOES AS A BILLIARD PLAYER DOES THE BALLS WHEN HE MAKES A BIG RUN AFTER THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN HAD BEEN DULY ANNOUNCED OUR SAINT LOUIS EXCURSION FRIENDS WHO HAD APPROACHED TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STOPPED SET OUT A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
3664-178355-0012 AND WHICH PROVED A GOOD DRINK ON A KANSAS PRAIRIE AND A BUFFALO HUNTER WAS A GOOD MAN TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHILE TAKING A SHORT REST WE SUDDENLY SPIED ANOTHER HERD OF BUFFALOES COMING TOWARD US IT WAS ONLY A SMALL DROVE AND WE AT ONCE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ANIMALS A LIVELY RECEPTION
3664-178355-0013 THEY PROVED TO BE A HERD OF COWS AND CALVES WHICH BY THE WAY ARE QUICKER IN THEIR MOVEMENTS THAN THE BULLS WE CHARGED IN AMONG THEM AND I CONCLUDED MY RUN WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTEEN WHILE COMSTOCK KILLED FOURTEEN
3664-178355-0014 WE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLE
3664-178355-0015 AND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONS
3664-178355-0016 WE RODE TO THE WINDWARD OF THE BUFFALOES AS USUAL AND WHEN WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF THEM WE DASHED INTO THE HERD I SOON HAD THIRTEEN LAID OUT ON THE GROUND THE LAST ONE OF WHICH I HAD DRIVEN DOWN CLOSE TO THE WAGONS WHERE THE LADIES WERE
3664-178355-0017 IT FRIGHTENED SOME OF THE TENDER CREATURES TO SEE THE BUFFALO COMING AT FULL SPEED DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF ONE OF THE WAGONS I SHOT HIM DEAD IN HIS TRACKS THIS MADE MY SIXTY NINTH BUFFALO AND FINISHED MY THIRD AND LAST RUN
3664-178355-0018 COMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCH
3664-178355-0019 THEY PREPARED TO DEPART HAVING DECLINED AN INVITATION TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
3664-178355-0020 HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPE
3664-178355-0021 OWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADS
3664-178355-0022 IN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE TO STATE THAT DURING THE TIME I WAS HUNTING FOR THE KANSAS PACIFIC I ALWAYS BROUGHT INTO CAMP THE BEST BUFFALO HEADS AND TURNED THEM OVER TO THE COMPANY WHO FOUND A VERY GOOD USE FOR THEM THEY HAD THEM MOUNTED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER
3664-178355-0023 AND SENT THEM TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND RAILROAD CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVING THEM PLACED IN PROMINENT POSITIONS AT THE LEADING HOTELS DEPOTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS AS A SORT OF TRADE MARK OR ADVERTISEMENT OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD
3664-178355-0024 AND TO DAY THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE TRAVELER ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHENEVER I AM TRAVELING OVER THE COUNTRY AND SEE ONE OF THESE TRADE MARKS I FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE OLD FELLOW WHOSE BODY IT ONCE ORNAMENTED
3664-178355-0025 MY SERVICES AS A HUNTER WERE NOT ANY LONGER REQUIRED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS A GENERAL INDIAN WAR RAGING ALL ALONG THE WESTERN BORDERS GENERAL SHERIDAN HAD TAKEN UP HIS HEADQUARTERS AT FORT HAYES IN ORDER TO BE IN THE FIELD TO SUPERINTEND THE CAMPAIGN IN PERSON
3664-178355-0026 AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
3664-178355-0027 I DETERMINED TO DISPOSE OF HIM I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO PART WITH HIM BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARDER USAGE IN OTHER HANDS THAN HE HAD IN MINE I HAD SEVERAL GOOD OFFERS TO SELL HIM
3664-178355-0028 BUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF SOME GENTLEMEN IN SHERIDAN ALL OF WHOM WERE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE HORSE I PUT HIM UP AT A RAFFLE IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM ALL AN EQUAL CHANCE OF BECOMING THE OWNER OF THE FAMOUS STEED THERE WERE TEN CHANCES AT THIRTY DOLLARS EACH AND THEY WERE ALL QUICKLY TAKEN
3664-178355-0029 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
3664-178355-0030 EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER BONHAM WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO RIDE THAT POKY LOOKING PLUG AGAINST THE FIVE THOROUGHBREDS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE RACE WHEN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTE
3664-178355-0031 FOR THE FIRST HALF MILE SEVERAL OF THE HORSES LED BRIGHAM BUT ON THE SECOND MILE HE BEGAN PASSING THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND ON THE THIRD MILE HE WAS IN ADVANCE OF THEM ALL AND WAS SHOWING THEM ALL THE ROAD AT A LIVELY RATE ON THE FOURTH MILE HIS RIDER LET HIM OUT
3664-178355-0032 AND ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL THE HOME STATION IN WYANDOTTE A LONG WAY AHEAD OF HIS FASTEST COMPETITOR EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AS WELL AS DISGUSTED THAT SUCH A HOMELY CRITTER SHOULD BE THE WINNER BRIGHAM OF COURSE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED A WIDE REPUTATION
3664-178355-0033 AND HIS NAME AND EXPLOITS HAD OFTEN APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN IT WAS LEARNED THAT THIS CRITTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL BUFFALO HUNTING BRIGHAM NEARLY THE WHOLE CROWD ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND HAD THEY KNOWN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RULED HIM OUT
3664-178355-0034 I FINALLY LOST TRACK OF BRIGHAM AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THREE YEARS AGO WHILE I WAS AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE I MET A MISTER WILCOX WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE OWNED BRIGHAM
3664-178355-0035 ONLY A FEW MILES OUT OF TOWN THE NEXT DAY I RODE OUT WITH MISTER WILCOX AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE GALLANT OLD HORSE HE WAS COMFORTABLY CARED FOR IN MISTER WILCOX'S STABLE AND LOOKED THE SAME CLEVER PONY THAT HE ALWAYS WAS IT SEEMED AS IF HE ALMOST REMEMBERED ME
3664-178355-0036 AND WHENEVER I AGAIN VISIT MEMPHIS I SHALL SURELY GO AND SEE BRIGHAM IF HE IS STILL ALIVE BUT TO RETURN TO THE THREAD OF MY NARRATIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE WANDERED
3664-178366-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SIX SIGHT SEEING GENERAL ORD COMMANDING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE PLATTE AT THE TIME AND WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE ALEXIS HUNT HAD SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AT FORT MC PHERSON
3664-178366-0001 AND I ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO RIDE OVER TO THE POST WITH HIM IN AN AMBULANCE ON THE WAY THITHER HE ASKED ME HOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY HE SAID THAT GENERAL SHERIDAN AND HIMSELF HAD HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MATTER
3664-178366-0002 AND IF I WANTED A COMMISSION ONE COULD EASILY BE PROCURED FOR ME I THANKED GENERAL ORD FOR HIS KINDNESS AND SAID THAT ALTHOUGH AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY WAS A TEMPTING PRIZE YET I PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN THE POSITION I WAS THEN HOLDING
3664-178366-0003 HAVING DETERMINED TO VISIT NEW YORK I ACTED UPON GENERAL SHERIDAN'S SUGGESTION AND WROTE TO GENERAL STAGER FROM WHOM IN A FEW DAYS I RECEIVED MY RAILROAD PASSES OBTAINING THIRTY DAYS LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT I STRUCK OUT FOR THE EAST
3664-178366-0004 ON ARRIVING IN CHICAGO IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY COLONEL M V SHERIDAN WHO SAID THAT HIS BROTHER THE GENERAL HAD NOT YET RETURNED
3664-178366-0005 BUT HAD SENT WORD THAT I WAS TO BE HIS AND THE COLONEL'S GUEST AT THEIR HOUSE WHILE I REMAINED IN CHICAGO I SPENT TWO OR THREE DAYS VERY PLEASANTLY IN THE GREAT CITY OF THE WEST MEETING SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SHERIDAN HUNT IN SEPTEMBER GENERAL STAGER
3664-178366-0006 COLONEL WILSON EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL MISTER SAM JOHNSON GENERAL RUCKER AND OTHERS BY ALL OF WHOM I WAS MOST CORDIALLY RECEIVED AND WELL ENTERTAINED I WAS INTRODUCED TO QUITE A NUMBER OF THE BEST PEOPLE OF THE CITY AND WAS INVITED TO SEVERAL SWELL DINNERS
3664-178366-0007 THAT IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FACE THE THRONG OF BEAUTIFUL LADIES
3664-178366-0008 I WAS TO STOP AT NIAGARA FALLS BUFFALO AND ROCHESTER ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK AND HE PROVIDED ME WITH ALL THE NECESSARY RAILROAD PASSES JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE CHICAGO I MET PROFESSOR HENRY A WARD OF ROCHESTER FOR WHOM DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR OR TWO
3664-178366-0009 I HAD COLLECTED A LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS OF WILD ANIMALS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO ROCHESTER AND KINDLY VOLUNTEERED TO ACT AS MY GUIDE UNTIL WE REACHED THAT POINT WE SPENT ONE DAY IN VIEWING THE WONDERS OF NIAGARA
3664-178366-0010 AND I HAD THE HONOR OF RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE MAYOR ON ARRIVING AT NEW YORK I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY MISTER J G HECKSHER WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED AS A COMMITTEE OF ONE TO ESCORT ME TO THE UNION CLUB
3664-178366-0011 WHERE JAMES GORDON BENNETT LEONARD W JEROME AND OTHERS WERE TO GIVE ME AN INFORMAL RECEPTION AND WHERE I WAS TO MAKE MY HEADQUARTERS DURING MY VISIT IN THE GREAT METROPOLIS I HAD AN ELEGANT DINNER AT THE CLUB ROOMS WITH THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SEPTEMBER HUNT AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLUB
3664-178366-0012 HE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE ME AND INSISTED ON MY BECOMING HIS GUEST HE WOULD LISTEN TO NO EXCUSES AND ON INTRODUCING ME TO MESSRS OVERTON AND BLAIR PROPRIETORS OF THE BREVOORT THEY ALSO GAVE ME A PRESSING INVITATION TO MAKE MY HOME AT THEIR HOUSE
3664-178366-0013 I FINALLY COMPROMISED THE MATTER BY AGREEING TO DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN THE UNION CLUB THE BREVOORT HOUSE AND NED BUNTLINE'S QUARTERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SPENT IN VIEWING THE SIGHTS OF NEW YORK EVERYTHING BEING NEW AND STARTLING
3664-178366-0014 CONVINCING ME THAT AS YET I HAD SEEN BUT A SMALL PORTION OF THE WORLD I RECEIVED NUMEROUS DINNER INVITATIONS AS WELL AS INVITATIONS TO VISIT DIFFERENT PLACES OF AMUSEMENT AND INTEREST BUT AS THEY CAME IN SO THICK AND FAST I SOON BECAME BADLY DEMORALIZED AND CONFUSED
3664-178366-0015 I FOUND I HAD ACCEPTED INVITATIONS TO DINE AT HALF A DOZEN OR MORE HOUSES ON THE SAME DAY AND AT THE SAME HOUR JAMES GORDON BENNETT HAD PREPARED A DINNER FOR ME AT WHICH QUITE A LARGE NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS WERE TO BE PRESENT
3664-178366-0016 BUT OWING TO MY CONFUSION ARISING FROM THE MANY OTHER INVITATIONS I HAD RECEIVED I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT AND DINED ELSEWHERE THIS WAS A BAD BREAK BUT I DID NOT LEARN OF MY MISTAKE UNTIL NEXT DAY WHEN AT THE UNION CLUB HOUSE SEVERAL GENTLEMEN AMONG THEM LAWRENCE JEROME
3664-178366-0017 AND WHY I HAD NOT PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT BENNETT'S DINNER THEY SAID THAT BENNETT HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO GIVE ME A SPLENDID RECEPTION THAT THE PARTY HAD WAITED TILL NINE O'CLOCK FOR ME AND THAT MY NON ARRIVAL CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
3664-178366-0018 I APOLOGIZED AS WELL AS I COULD BY SAYING THAT I HAD BEEN OUT ON A SCOUT AND HAD GOT LOST AND HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE DINNER AND EXPRESSED MY REGRET FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD CREATED BY MY FORGETFULNESS AUGUST BELMONT THE BANKER BEING NEAR SAID
3664-178366-0019 NEVER MIND GENTLEMEN I'LL GIVE CODY A DINNER AT MY HOUSE THANK YOU SIR SAID I I SEE YOU ARE DETERMINED THAT I SHALL NOT RUN SHORT OF RATIONS WHILE I AM IN THE CITY I'LL BE THERE SURE
3664-178366-0020 BOTH MISTER JEROME AND MISTER HECKSHER TOLD ME THAT I MUST NOT DISAPPOINT MISTER BELMONT FOR HIS DINNERS WERE SPLENDID AFFAIRS I MADE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME I WAS PROMPTLY AT MISTER BELMONT'S MANSION WHERE I SPENT A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENING
3664-178366-0021 MISTER BENNETT WHO WAS AMONG THE GUESTS HAVING FORGIVEN MY CARELESSNESS INVITED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE LIEDERKRANZ MASKED BALL WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN A FEW EVENINGS AND WOULD BE A GRAND SPECTACLE TOGETHER WE ATTENDED THE BALL AND DURING THE EVENING I WAS WELL ENTERTAINED
3664-178366-0022 THE DANCERS KEPT ON THEIR MASKS UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND THE MERRY AND MOTLEY THRONG PRESENTED A BRILLIANT SCENE MOVING GRACEFULLY BENEATH THE BRIGHT GAS LIGHT TO THE INSPIRITING MUSIC TO ME IT WAS A NOVEL AND ENTERTAINING SIGHT
3664-178366-0023 AND EXHIBITED SOME OF MY BACKWOODS STEPS WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT AS GRACEFUL AS SOME WERE A GREAT DEAL MORE EMPHATIC BUT WHEN I UNDERTOOK TO DO ARTISTIC DANCING I FOUND I WAS DECIDEDLY OUT OF PLACE IN THAT CROWD AND I ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW FROM THE FLOOR
3664-178366-0024 I OCCASIONALLY PASSED AN EVENING AT NIBLO'S GARDEN VIEWING THE MANY BEAUTIES OF THE BLACK CROOK WHICH WAS THEN HAVING ITS LONG RUN UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF JARRETT AND PALMER WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE I HAD MADE AND WHO EXTENDED TO ME THE FREEDOM OF THE THEATER
3664-178366-0025 NED BUNTLINE AND FRED MAEDER HAD DRAMATIZED ONE OF THE STORIES WHICH THE FORMER HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ME FOR THE NEW YORK WEEKLY THE DRAMA WAS CALLED BUFFALO BILL THE KING OF BORDER MEN WHILE I WAS IN NEW YORK IT WAS PRODUCED AT THE BOWERY THEATER
3664-178366-0026 AND OF COURSE I WAS PRESENT ON THE OPENING NIGHT A PRIVATE BOX HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR ME THE THEATER WAS PACKED EVERY SEAT BEING OCCUPIED AS WELL AS THE STANDING ROOM THE DRAMA WAS PLAYED SMOOTHLY AND CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0027 THE AUDIENCE UPON LEARNING THAT THE REAL BUFFALO BILL WAS PRESENT GAVE SEVERAL CHEERS BETWEEN THE ACTS AND I WAS CALLED ON TO COME OUT ON THE STAGE AND MAKE A SPEECH
3664-178366-0028 AND THAT I SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO MISTER STUDLEY I FINALLY CONSENTED AND THE NEXT MOMENT I FOUND MYSELF STANDING BEHIND THE FOOTLIGHTS AND IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I LOOKED UP THEN DOWN THEN ON EACH SIDE AND EVERYWHERE I SAW A SEA OF HUMAN FACES
3664-178366-0029 BUT WHAT THEY WERE I COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME TELL NOR COULD ANY ONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE MY UTTERANCES WERE INAUDIBLE EVEN TO THE LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA MISTER DEAN WHO WAS SITTING ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF ME BOWING TO THE AUDIENCE I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO ONE OF THE CANONS OF THE STAGE
3664-178366-0030 I NEVER FELT MORE RELIEVED IN MY LIFE THAN WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE VIEW OF THAT IMMENSE CROWD THAT EVENING MISTER FRELEIGH OFFERED TO GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK TO PLAY THE PART OF BUFFALO BILL MYSELF
3664-178366-0031 AND THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO MAKE AN ACTOR OUT OF A GOVERNMENT MULE I THANKED HIM FOR THE GENEROUS OFFER WHICH I HAD TO DECLINE OWING TO A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF OR AS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EXPRESS IT I DIDN'T HAVE THE REQUISITE CHEEK TO UNDERTAKE A THING OF THAT SORT
3664-178366-0032 THE PLAY OF BUFFALO BILL HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL RUN OF SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AND WAS AFTERWARDS PRODUCED IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE BEING RECEIVED WITH GENUINE ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0033 I MET HIM SOON AFTER HE GOT INTO TOWN IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION HOW I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF I REPLIED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE BEST CAMP I HAD EVER SEEN AND IF HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ABOUT TEN DAYS
3664-178366-0034 THIS HE WILLINGLY DID AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT MY SERVICES WOULD SOON BE REQUIRED AT FORT MC PHERSON AS THERE WAS TO BE AN EXPEDITION SENT OUT FROM THAT POINT AT WESTCHESTER PENNSYLVANIA I HAD SOME RELATIVES LIVING WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN
3664-178366-0035 AND NOW BEING SO NEAR I DETERMINED TO MAKE THEM A VISIT UPON MENTIONING THE MATTER TO BUNTLINE HE SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD TOGETHER TAKE A TRIP TO PHILADELPHIA AND THENCE RUN OUT TO WESTCHESTER
3664-178366-0036 AMONG THEM AN ELDERLY LADY WHO WAS MY GRANDMOTHER AS HE INFORMED ME HE TOLD ME THAT MY AUNT ELIZA HIS FIRST WIFE WAS DEAD AND THAT HE HAD MARRIED A SECOND TIME LIZZIE GUSS MY COUSIN I THOUGHT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL I HAD EVER SEEN
3664-178366-0037 THEY WERE ALL VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE US REMAIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT AS I HAD SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO IN NEW YORK I WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN THAT DAY ASSURING THEM HOWEVER THAT I WOULD VISIT THEM AGAIN SOON I BADE THEM ADIEU AND WITH BUNTLINE TOOK THE TRAIN FOR NEW YORK
298-126791-0000 THE MORNING FOUND THEM ALL RESTORED IN SOME MEASURE TO THEIR FORMER EASE OF BODY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS WHO HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY REGRETTED BY DUNWOODIE THE WOUND OF THIS OFFICER WAS SEVERE THOUGH THE SURGEON PERSEVERED IN SAYING THAT IT WAS WITHOUT DANGER
298-126791-0001 AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
298-126791-0002 HE BREAKFASTED IN HIS OWN ROOM AND NOTWITHSTANDING CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SMILES OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE
298-126791-0003 AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE

298-126791-0009 HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
298-126791-0010 IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES

298-126791-0015 THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
298-126791-0016 FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
298-126791-0017 AT THE TIME OF OUR TALE WE WERE A DIVIDED PEOPLE AND SARAH THOUGHT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HER DUTY TO CHERISH THE INSTITUTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY TO WHICH SHE YET CLUNG AS THE LAND OF HER FOREFATHERS BUT THERE WERE OTHER AND MORE COGENT REASONS FOR THE SILENT PREFERENCE SHE WAS GIVING TO THE ENGLISHMAN

298-126791-0021 HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
298-126791-0022 AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
298-126791-0023 THE SISTERS THEN SOUGHT THE FRESH AIR ON THE PIAZZA AND AS THEY PURSUED THEIR WALK ARM IN ARM THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TOOK PLACE THERE IS SOMETHING DISAGREEABLE ABOUT THIS SURGEON OF DUNWOODIE SAID SARAH THAT CAUSES ME TO WISH HIM AWAY MOST HEARTILY
298-126791-0024 FRANCES FIXED HER LAUGHING EYES ON HER SISTER BUT FORBEARING TO SPEAK THE OTHER READILY CONSTRUED THEIR EXPRESSION AND HASTILY ADDED BUT I FORGET HE IS ONE OF YOUR RENOWNED CORPS OF VIRGINIANS AND MUST BE SPOKEN OF REVERENTLY AS RESPECTFULLY AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SISTER
298-126791-0025 THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
298-126791-0026 BUT I THINK MISTER DUNWOODIE HAS TAKEN A LIBERTY THAT EXCEEDS THE RIGHTS OF CONSANGUINITY HE HAS MADE OUR FATHER'S HOUSE A HOSPITAL WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF THE PATIENTS IT CONTAINS ARE DEARER TO US YOUR BROTHER IS ONE TRUE TRUE INTERRUPTED FRANCES BLUSHING TO THE EYES
298-126791-0027 BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
298-126791-0028 A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
298-126791-0029 HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
298-126791-0030 AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
298-126791-0031 THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE
298-126791-0032 IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
298-126791-0033 STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
298-126791-0034 AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
298-126791-0035 DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
298-126791-0036 FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
298-126791-0037 THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
298-126791-0038 AND HAVING GAINED THE ROOM WHERE THE LATTER CONDUCTED HER WEPT IN SILENCE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE OBSERVANT AND SOOTHING GIRL UNTIL FRANCES THOUGHT HER TEARS EXCEEDED THE EMOTION NATURAL TO THE OCCASION
298-126791-0039 THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
298-126791-0040 MORE COMPOSED THAN HER PREVIOUS AGITATION HAD GIVEN REASON TO EXPECT ISABELLA FOUND HER BROTHER LOOKING BETTER AND IN LESS DANGER THAN HER SENSITIVE IMAGINATION HAD LED HER TO SUPPOSE HER SPIRITS ROSE IN PROPORTION FROM DESPONDENCY SHE PASSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GAYETY
298-126791-0041 HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
298-126791-0042 IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
298-126791-0043 WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
298-126791-0044 HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN BRINGING ME A NURSE WHOSE PRESENCE ALONE IS ABLE TO RAISE ME FROM MY COUCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE LADY'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED
298-126791-0045 BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
298-126791-0046 DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
298-126791-0047 ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
298-126791-0048 HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
298-126791-0049 FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
298-126791-0050 THE EYE OF THE SISTER WAS NOW BENT ON THE FACE OF THE TROOPER WHO MADE HIS SALUTATIONS TO THE LADY WITH EASE BLENDED WITH THE FRANKNESS OF A SOLDIER HIS MAN HAS BEEN HERE TWICE HE SAID TO INQUIRE HOW WE FARED IN THE LAZARETTO AND WHY NOT HIMSELF
298-126791-0051 THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
298-126791-0052 MY SWORD ARM IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION AND ROANOKE HAS BUT A SHAMBLING GAIT THIS MORNING BESIDES THERE IS ANOTHER REASON I COULD MENTION IF IT WERE NOT THAT MISS WHARTON WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
298-126791-0053 SPEAK I BEG WITHOUT DREAD OF MY DISPLEASURE SAID FRANCES RETURNING THE GOOD HUMORED SMILE OF THE TROOPER WITH THE ARCHNESS NATURAL TO HER OWN SWEET FACE THE ODORS OF YOUR KITCHEN THEN CRIED LAWTON BLUNTLY FORBID MY QUITTING THE DOMAINS UNTIL I QUALIFY MYSELF TO SPEAK WITH MORE CERTAINTY CONCERNING THE FATNESS OF THE LAND
298-126791-0054 OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
298-126791-0055 FRANCES WITHDREW TO SEEK HER AUNT MUSING DEEPLY ON THE CHARACTER AND EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE CHANCE HAD BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE THE WOUNDED OFFICER FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE MOVED WITH INFANTILE GRACE THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS APARTMENT AND AS SHE VANISHED FROM HIS VIEW HE OBSERVED
298-126791-0056 A GOOD MOTHERLY LADY BUT AS TO LOVE THAT IS A MATTER OF TASTE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER WITH DEFERENCE TO HER PRUDENCE AND EXPERIENCE WOULD ACCORD BETTER WITH MY FANCY SHE MUST BE UNDER TWENTY SAID THE OTHER QUICKLY IT DEPENDS ON THE WAY YOU COUNT IF YOU BEGIN AT THE HEEL OF LIFE WELL
298-126791-0057 BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
298-126791-0058 THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
298-126791-0059 TO HIS GREAT JOY HIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE STEED TO BE EQUALLY CONVALESCENT WITH THE MASTER AND LAWTON FOUND THAT BY DINT OF RUBBING THE ANIMAL'S LIMBS SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT CEASING HE WAS ENABLED TO PLACE HIS FEET IN WHAT HE CALLED SYSTEMATIC MOTION
298-126791-0060 ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
298-126791-0061 AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
298-126791-0062 WHARTON KNEW THAT THEIR MISFORTUNE AS THEY BOTH TERMED THEIR DEFEAT WAS OWING TO THE OTHER'S RASHNESS BUT HE FORBORE TO SPEAK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT WHICH HAD DEPRIVED THE ENGLISH OF THEIR LEADER AND TO WHICH HE GOOD NATUREDLY ASCRIBED THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISCOMFITURE
298-126791-0063 IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
298-126791-0064 HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
298-126791-0065 YES SAID THE OTHER SENDING THE SECOND SLIPPER AFTER THE FIRST AND THIS MAJOR DUNWOODIE NEVER OVERLOOKS AN ADVANTAGE I THINK IF WE HAD THE THING TO DO OVER AGAIN CONTINUED THE COLONEL RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS FEET WE MIGHT ALTER THE CASE VERY MATERIALLY THOUGH THE CHIEF THING THE REBELS HAVE NOW TO BOAST OF IS MY CAPTURE
298-126791-0066 THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
298-126791-0067 TRUE TRUE CRIED THE COLONEL WITH ANIMATION HAD I BEEN THERE TO HAVE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE TABLE ON THE YANKEES SAYING WHICH HE DISPLAYED STILL GREATER ANIMATION IN COMPLETING HIS TOILET AND HE WAS SOON PREPARED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE FULLY RESTORED TO HIS OWN GOOD OPINION AND FAIRLY PERSUADED THAT HIS CAPTURE WAS OWING TO CASUALTIES ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MAN
3214-167606-0000 WHEN PIERRE RETURNED HOME HE WAS HANDED TWO OF ROSTOPCHIN'S BROADSHEETS THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT THAT DAY
3214-167606-0001 ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS GLAD THAT LADIES AND TRADESMEN'S WIVES WERE LEAVING THE CITY THERE WILL BE LESS PANIC AND LESS GOSSIP RAN THE BROADSHEET
3214-167606-0002 THAT THE FRENCH WOULD ENTER MOSCOW THE SECOND BROADSHEET STATED THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE AT VYAZMA THAT COUNT WITTGENSTEIN HAD DEFEATED THE FRENCH BUT THAT AS MANY OF THE INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW WISHED TO BE ARMED WEAPONS WERE READY FOR THEM AT THE ARSENAL
3214-167606-0003 WITH THE WHOLE STRENGTH OF HIS SOUL BUT WHICH YET AROUSED INVOLUNTARY HORROR IN HIM WAS DRAWING NEAR SHALL I JOIN THE ARMY AND ENTER THE SERVICE
3214-167606-0004 IF THIS PATIENCE COMES OUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF AFTER SHUFFLING THE CARDS HOLDING THEM IN HIS HAND AND LIFTING HIS HEAD IF IT COMES OUT IT MEANS WHAT DOES IT MEAN HE HAD NOT DECIDED WHAT IT SHOULD MEAN WHEN HE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE ELDEST PRINCESS
3214-167606-0005 AT THE DOOR ASKING WHETHER SHE MIGHT COME IN THEN IT WILL MEAN THAT I MUST GO TO THE ARMY SAID PIERRE TO HIMSELF COME IN COME IN HE ADDED TO THE PRINCESS ONLY THE ELDEST PRINCESS THE ONE WITH THE STONY FACE AND LONG WAIST WAS STILL LIVING IN PIERRE'S HOUSE
3214-167606-0006 EVERYONE HAS LEFT MOSCOW AND THE PEOPLE ARE RIOTING HOW IS IT THAT WE ARE STAYING ON ON THE CONTRARY THINGS SEEM SATISFACTORY MA COUSINE SAID PIERRE IN THE BANTERING TONE HE HABITUALLY ADOPTED TOWARD HER ALWAYS FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE ROLE OF HER BENEFACTOR
3214-167606-0007 SATISFACTORY INDEED VERY SATISFACTORY BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME TODAY HOW OUR TROOPS ARE DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES IT CERTAINLY DOES THEM CREDIT AND THE PEOPLE TOO ARE QUITE MUTINOUS
3214-167606-0008 THEY NO LONGER OBEY EVEN MY MAID HAS TAKEN TO BEING RUDE AT THIS RATE THEY WILL SOON BEGIN BEATING US ONE CAN'T WALK IN THE STREETS BUT ABOVE ALL THE FRENCH WILL BE HERE ANY DAY NOW SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR I ASK JUST ONE THING OF YOU COUSIN SHE WENT ON
3214-167606-0009 ARRANGE FOR ME TO BE TAKEN TO PETERSBURG WHATEVER I MAY BE I CAN'T LIVE UNDER BONAPARTE'S RULE OH COME MA COUSINE WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION FROM ON THE CONTRARY
3214-167606-0010 I WON'T SUBMIT TO YOUR NAPOLEON OTHERS MAY IF THEY PLEASE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS BUT I WILL I'LL GIVE THE ORDER AT ONCE THE PRINCESS WAS APPARENTLY VEXED AT NOT HAVING ANYONE TO BE ANGRY WITH MUTTERING TO HERSELF SHE SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR
3214-167606-0011 BUT YOU HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED SAID PIERRE EVERYTHING IS QUIET IN THE CITY AND THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DANGER SEE I'VE JUST BEEN READING HE SHOWED HER THE BROADSHEET
3214-167606-0012 OH THAT COUNT OF YOURS SAID THE PRINCESS MALEVOLENTLY HE IS A HYPOCRITE A RASCAL WHO HAS HIMSELF ROUSED THE PEOPLE TO RIOT DIDN'T HE WRITE IN THOSE IDIOTIC BROADSHEETS THAT ANYONE WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE SHOULD BE DRAGGED TO THE LOCKUP BY HIS HAIR HOW SILLY
3214-167606-0013 AND HONOR AND GLORY TO WHOEVER CAPTURES HIM HE SAYS THIS IS WHAT HIS CAJOLERY HAS BROUGHT US TO BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME THE MOB NEAR KILLED HER BECAUSE SHE SAID SOMETHING IN FRENCH OH BUT IT'S SO YOU
3214-167606-0014 TAKE EVERYTHING SO TO HEART SAID PIERRE AND BEGAN LAYING OUT HIS CARDS FOR PATIENCE ALTHOUGH THAT PATIENCE DID COME OUT PIERRE DID NOT JOIN THE ARMY BUT REMAINED IN DESERTED MOSCOW EVER IN THE SAME STATE OF AGITATION
3214-167606-0015 IRRESOLUTION AND ALARM YET AT THE SAME TIME JOYFULLY EXPECTING SOMETHING TERRIBLE NEXT DAY TOWARD EVENING THE PRINCESS SET OFF AND PIERRE'S HEAD STEWARD CAME TO INFORM HIM THAT THE MONEY NEEDED FOR THE EQUIPMENT OF HIS REGIMENT
3214-167606-0016 COULD NOT BE FOUND WITHOUT SELLING ONE OF THE ESTATES IN GENERAL THE HEAD STEWARD MADE OUT TO PIERRE THAT HIS PROJECT OF RAISING A REGIMENT WOULD RUIN HIM PIERRE LISTENED TO HIM SCARCELY ABLE TO REPRESS A SMILE
3214-167606-0017 WELL THEN SELL IT SAID HE WHAT'S TO BE DONE I CAN'T DRAW BACK NOW THE WORSE EVERYTHING BECAME ESPECIALLY HIS OWN AFFAIRS THE BETTER WAS PIERRE PLEASED AND THE MORE EVIDENT WAS IT THAT THE CATASTROPHE HE EXPECTED WAS APPROACHING
3214-167606-0018 HARDLY ANYONE HE KNEW WAS LEFT IN TOWN JULIE HAD GONE AND SO HAD PRINCESS MARY OF HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS ONLY THE ROSTOVS REMAINED BUT HE DID NOT GO TO SEE THEM TO DISTRACT HIS THOUGHTS HE DROVE THAT DAY TO THE VILLAGE OF
3214-167606-0019 VORONTSOVO TO SEE THE GREAT BALLOON LEPPICH WAS CONSTRUCTING TO DESTROY THE FOE AND A TRIAL BALLOON THAT WAS TO GO UP NEXT DAY THE BALLOON WAS NOT YET READY BUT PIERRE LEARNED THAT IT WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED BY THE EMPEROR'S DESIRE
3214-167606-0020 GET TOGETHER A CREW OF RELIABLE AND INTELLIGENT MEN FOR HIS CAR AND SEND A COURIER TO GENERAL KUTUZOV TO LET HIM KNOW I HAVE INFORMED HIM OF THE MATTER PLEASE IMPRESS UPON LEPPICH TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHERE HE DESCENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME
3214-167606-0021 THAT HE MAY NOT MAKE A MISTAKE AND FALL INTO THE ENEMY'S HANDS IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR HIM TO COMBINE HIS MOVEMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON HIS WAY HOME FROM VORONTSOVO
3214-167606-0022 STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF HIS TRAP A FRENCH COOK ACCUSED OF BEING A SPY WAS BEING FLOGGED THE FLOGGING WAS ONLY JUST OVER AND THE EXECUTIONER WAS RELEASING FROM THE FLOGGING BENCH A STOUT MAN WITH RED WHISKERS IN BLUE STOCKINGS AND A GREEN JACKET
3214-167606-0023 WHO WAS MOANING PITEOUSLY ANOTHER CRIMINAL THIN AND PALE STOOD NEAR JUDGING BY THEIR FACES THEY WERE BOTH FRENCHMEN WITH A FRIGHTENED AND SUFFERING LOOK RESEMBLING THAT ON THE THIN FRENCHMAN'S FACE PIERRE PUSHED HIS WAY IN THROUGH THE CROWD
3214-167606-0024 WHAT IS IT WHO IS IT WHAT IS IT FOR HE KEPT ASKING BUT THE ATTENTION OF THE CROWD OFFICIALS BURGHERS SHOPKEEPERS PEASANTS AND WOMEN IN CLOAKS AND IN PELISSES
3214-167606-0025 THAT NO ONE ANSWERED HIM THE STOUT MAN ROSE FROWNED SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND EVIDENTLY TRYING TO APPEAR FIRM BEGAN TO PULL ON HIS JACKET WITHOUT LOOKING ABOUT HIM BUT SUDDENLY HIS LIPS TREMBLED AND HE BEGAN TO CRY
3214-167606-0026 RUSSIAN SAUCE SEEMS TO BE SOUR TO A FRENCHMAN SETS HIS TEETH ON EDGE SAID A WRINKLED CLERK WHO WAS STANDING BEHIND PIERRE WHEN THE FRENCHMAN BEGAN TO CRY THE CLERK GLANCED ROUND EVIDENTLY HOPING THAT HIS JOKE WOULD BE APPRECIATED
3214-167606-0027 SOME PEOPLE BEGAN TO LAUGH OTHERS CONTINUED TO WATCH IN DISMAY THE EXECUTIONER WHO WAS UNDRESSING THE OTHER MAN PIERRE CHOKED HIS FACE PUCKERED AND HE TURNED HASTILY AWAY WENT BACK TO HIS TRAP MUTTERING SOMETHING TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT AND TOOK HIS SEAT
3214-167606-0028 AS THEY DROVE ALONG HE SHUDDERED AND EXCLAIMED SEVERAL TIMES SO AUDIBLY THAT THE COACHMAN ASKED HIM WHAT IS YOUR PLEASURE WHERE ARE YOU GOING SHOUTED PIERRE TO THE MAN WHO WAS DRIVING TO LUBYANKA STREET
3214-167606-0029 AT THE SIGHT OF THE TORTURED FRENCHMAN AND THE CROWD SURROUNDING THE LOBNOE PLACE PIERRE HAD SO DEFINITELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE COULD NO LONGER REMAIN IN MOSCOW AND WOULD LEAVE FOR THE ARMY THAT VERY DAY THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT EITHER
3214-167606-0030 HE HAD TOLD THE COACHMAN THIS OR THAT THE MAN OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN IT FOR HIMSELF ON REACHING HOME PIERRE GAVE ORDERS TO EVSTAFEY HIS HEAD COACHMAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHING COULD DO ANYTHING AND WAS KNOWN TO ALL MOSCOW
3214-167606-0031 AND THAT HIS SADDLE HORSES SHOULD BE SENT THERE THIS COULD NOT ALL BE ARRANGED THAT DAY SO ON
3214-167606-0032 THIS WAS THE BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE IN PERKHUSHKOVO THE EARTH TREMBLED FROM THE FIRING BUT NOBODY COULD ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS AS TO WHO HAD WON AT DAWN NEXT DAY PIERRE WAS APPROACHING MOZHAYSK
3214-167606-0033 EVERY HOUSE IN MOZHAYSK HAD SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN IT AND AT THE HOSTEL WHERE PIERRE WAS MET BY HIS GROOM AND COACHMAN THERE WAS NO ROOM TO BE HAD IT WAS FULL OF OFFICERS
3214-167606-0034 EVERYWHERE IN MOZHAYSK AND BEYOND IT TROOPS WERE STATIONED OR ON THE MARCH COSSACKS FOOT AND HORSE SOLDIERS WAGONS CAISSONS AND CANNON WERE EVERYWHERE
3214-167606-0035 PIERRE PUSHED FORWARD AS FAST AS HE COULD AND THE FARTHER HE LEFT MOSCOW BEHIND AND THE DEEPER HE PLUNGED INTO THAT SEA OF TROOPS THE MORE WAS HE OVERCOME BY RESTLESS AGITATION AND A NEW AND JOYFUL FEELING HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE
3214-167606-0036 THE COMFORTS OF LIFE WEALTH EVEN LIFE ITSELF IS RUBBISH IT IS PLEASANT TO THROW AWAY COMPARED WITH SOMETHING WITH WHAT PIERRE COULD NOT SAY AND HE DID NOT TRY TO DETERMINE FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT HE FELT SUCH PARTICULAR DELIGHT IN SACRIFICING EVERYTHING
3214-167607-0000 WHY AND HOW WERE THE BATTLES OF SHEVARDINO AND BORODINO GIVEN AND ACCEPTED WHY WAS THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FOUGHT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SENSE IN IT FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT FOR THE RUSSIANS WAS AND WAS BOUND TO BE
3214-167607-0001 THAT WE WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOW WHICH WE FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD AND FOR THE FRENCH ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR WHOLE ARMY WHICH THEY FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
3214-167607-0002 WHAT THE RESULT MUST BE WAS QUITE OBVIOUS AND YET NAPOLEON OFFERED AND KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THAT BATTLE IF THE COMMANDERS HAD BEEN GUIDED BY REASON IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0003 THAT BY ADVANCING THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILES AND GIVING BATTLE WITH A PROBABILITY OF LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMY HE WAS ADVANCING TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN EQUALLY CLEAR TO KUTUZOV THAT BY ACCEPTING BATTLE
3214-167607-0004 AND GO ON EXCHANGING I SHALL CERTAINLY LOSE AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT EXCHANGE WHEN MY OPPONENT HAS SIXTEEN MEN AND I HAVE FOURTEEN I AM ONLY ONE EIGHTH WEAKER THAN HE BUT WHEN I HAVE EXCHANGED THIRTEEN MORE MEN
3214-167607-0005 HE WILL BE THREE TIMES AS STRONG AS I AM BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BORODINO OUR STRENGTH IN PROPORTION TO THE FRENCH WAS ABOUT AS FIVE TO SIX BUT AFTER THAT BATTLE IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN ONE TO TWO PREVIOUSLY
3214-167607-0006 WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND AFTERWARDS LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED THOUSAND YET THE SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THE BATTLE WHILE NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0007 AS HE HAD ENDED A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BY OCCUPYING VIENNA THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NAPOLEON'S HISTORIANS THEMSELVES TELL US THAT FROM SMOLENSK ONWARDS HE WISHED TO STOP
3214-167607-0008 TO HIS REPEATED ANNOUNCEMENTS OF HIS WISH TO NEGOTIATE IN GIVING AND ACCEPTING BATTLE AT BORODINO KUTUZOV ACTED INVOLUNTARILY AND IRRATIONALLY BUT LATER ON TO FIT WHAT HAD OCCURRED
3214-167607-0009 THE HISTORIANS PROVIDED CUNNINGLY DEVISED EVIDENCE
3214-167607-0010 OF ALL THE BLIND TOOLS OF HISTORY WERE THE MOST ENSLAVED AND INVOLUNTARY THE ANCIENTS HAVE LEFT US MODEL HEROIC POEMS IN WHICH THE HEROES FURNISH THE WHOLE INTEREST OF THE STORY
3214-167607-0011 AND WE ARE STILL UNABLE TO ACCUSTOM OURSELVES TO THE FACT THAT FOR OUR EPOCH HISTORIES OF THAT KIND ARE MEANINGLESS ON THE OTHER QUESTION HOW THE BATTLE OF BORODINO AND THE PRECEDING BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO WERE FOUGHT
3214-167607-0012 THERE ALSO EXISTS A DEFINITE AND WELL KNOWN BUT QUITE FALSE CONCEPTION ALL THE HISTORIANS DESCRIBE THE AFFAIR AS FOLLOWS THE RUSSIAN ARMY THEY SAY IN ITS RETREAT FROM SMOLENSK SOUGHT OUT FOR ITSELF THE BEST POSITION FOR A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT
3214-167607-0013 AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ON THE SHEVARDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH WE ARE TOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT
3214-167607-0014 AND ON THE TWENTY SIXTH ATTACKED THE WHOLE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WAS IN POSITION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO SO THE HISTORIES SAY AND IT IS ALL QUITE WRONG AS ANYONE WHO CARES TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER CAN EASILY CONVINCE HIMSELF
3214-167607-0015 THE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEK OUT THE BEST POSITION BUT ON THE CONTRARY DURING THE RETREAT PASSED MANY POSITIONS BETTER THAN BORODINO THEY DID NOT STOP AT ANY ONE OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE KUTUZOV DID NOT WISH TO OCCUPY A POSITION
3214-167607-0016 HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMAND FOR A BATTLE HAD NOT YET EXPRESSED ITSELF STRONGLY ENOUGH AND BECAUSE MILORADOVICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED WITH THE MILITIA AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
3214-167607-0017 THE FACT IS THAT OTHER POSITIONS THEY HAD PASSED WERE STRONGER AND THAT THE POSITION AT BORODINO THE ONE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT FAR FROM BEING STRONG WAS NO MORE A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER SPOT ONE MIGHT FIND IN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE
3214-167607-0018 BY STICKING A PIN INTO THE MAP AT HAZARD NOT ONLY DID THE RUSSIANS NOT FORTIFY THE POSITION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO TO THE LEFT OF AND AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE HIGHROAD
3214-167607-0019 THAT IS THE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE BUT NEVER TILL THE TWENTY FIFTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN TWELVE DID THEY THINK THAT A BATTLE MIGHT BE FOUGHT THERE THIS WAS SHOWN FIRST BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO ENTRENCHMENTS THERE BY THE TWENTY FIFTH
3214-167607-0020 AND THAT THOSE BEGUN ON THE TWENTY FIFTH AND TWENTY SIXTH WERE NOT COMPLETED AND SECONDLY BY THE POSITION OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT THAT REDOUBT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN FRONT OF THE POSITION WHERE THE BATTLE WAS ACCEPTED
3214-167607-0021 STRONGLY FORTIFIED THAN ANY OTHER POST AND WHY WERE ALL EFFORTS EXHAUSTED AND SIX THOUSAND MEN SACRIFICED TO DEFEND IT TILL LATE AT NIGHT ON THE TWENTY FOURTH A COSSACK PATROL WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY THIRDLY
3214-167607-0022 THAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS AN ADVANCED POST WHEREAS IN REALITY IT WAS SIMPLY A FORTIFIED POINT ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION PREVIOUSLY SELECTED WHERE
3214-167607-0023 WHICH CROSSES THE HIGHROAD NOT AT A RIGHT ANGLE BUT AT AN ACUTE ANGLE SO THAT THE LEFT FLANK WAS AT SHEVARDINO
3214-167607-0024 AND THE CENTER AT BORODINO AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE RIVERS KOLOCHA AND VOYNA TO ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT THE FIELD OF BORODINO WITHOUT THINKING OF HOW THE BATTLE WAS ACTUALLY FOUGHT THIS POSITION
3214-167607-0025 PROTECTED BY THE RIVER KOLOCHA PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLENSK ROAD TO MOSCOW NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0026 ON THE TWENTY FOURTH DID NOT SEE AS THE HISTORY BOOKS SAY HE DID THE POSITION OF THE RUSSIANS FROM UTITSA TO BORODINO HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT POSITION BECAUSE IT DID NOT EXIST NOR DID HE SEE AN ADVANCED POST OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY
3214-167607-0027 BUT WHILE PURSUING THE RUSSIAN REARGUARD HE CAME UPON THE LEFT FLANK OF THE RUSSIAN POSITION AT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT AND UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THE RUSSIANS MOVED HIS ARMY ACROSS THE KOLOCHA
3214-167607-0028 AND THE RUSSIANS NOT HAVING TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD INTENDED TO OCCUPY AND TOOK UP A NEW POSITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND WAS NOT FORTIFIED
3214-167607-0029 BY CROSSING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE KOLOCHA TO THE LEFT OF THE HIGHROAD NAPOLEON SHIFTED THE WHOLE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT LOOKING FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THE PLAIN BETWEEN UTITSA
3214-167607-0030 SEMENOVSK AND BORODINO A PLAIN NO MORE ADVANTAGEOUS AS A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER PLAIN IN RUSSIA AND THERE THE WHOLE BATTLE OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST TOOK PLACE
3214-167607-0031 HAD NAPOLEON NOT RIDDEN OUT ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH TO THE KOLOCHA AND HAD HE NOT THEN ORDERED AN IMMEDIATE ATTACK ON THE REDOUBT BUT HAD BEGUN THE ATTACK NEXT MORNING
3214-167607-0032 WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHERE WE EXPECTED IT IN THAT CASE WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE DEFENDED THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT OUR LEFT FLANK STILL MORE OBSTINATELY WE SHOULD HAVE ATTACKED NAPOLEON IN THE CENTER OR ON THE RIGHT
3214-167607-0033 AND THE ENGAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THE TWENTY FIFTH IN THE POSITION WE INTENDED AND HAD FORTIFIED BUT AS THE ATTACK ON OUR LEFT FLANK TOOK PLACE IN THE EVENING AFTER THE RETREAT OF OUR REAR GUARD THAT IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIGHT
3214-167607-0034 AT GRIDNEVA AND AS THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS DID NOT WISH OR WERE NOT IN TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT THEN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH THE FIRST AND CHIEF ACTION OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
3214-167607-0035 WAS ALREADY LOST ON THE TWENTY FOURTH AND OBVIOUSLY LED TO THE LOSS OF THE ONE FOUGHT ON THE TWENTY SIXTH AFTER THE LOSS OF THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT
3214-167607-0036 NOT ONLY WAS THE RUSSIAN ARMY ON THE TWENTY SIXTH DEFENDED BY WEAK UNFINISHED ENTRENCHMENTS BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT POSITION WAS INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS
3214-167607-0037 NAMELY THE LOSS OF OUR POSITION ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THE SHIFTING OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF THE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
3214-167607-0038 AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD TO MOVE THEIR FORCES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT DURING THE BATTLE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BATTLE THE RUSSIANS OPPOSED THE ENTIRE FRENCH ARMY LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR LEFT FLANK WITH BUT HALF AS MANY MEN
3214-167607-0039 PONIATOWSKI'S ACTION AGAINST UTITSA AND UVAROV'S ON THE RIGHT FLANK AGAINST THE FRENCH WERE ACTIONS DISTINCT FROM THE MAIN COURSE OF THE BATTLE SO THE BATTLE OF BORODINO DID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ALL AS
3214-167607-0040 IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL OUR COMMANDERS MISTAKES EVEN AT THE COST OF DIMINISHING THE GLORY DUE TO THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
1455-138263-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GRAVE QUESTIONS
1455-138263-0001 AND BARBICANE AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION THE BRILLIANT RAYS WHICH THE CELEBRATED MOUNTAIN SHED SO CURIOUSLY OVER THE HORIZON WHAT WAS THIS RADIANT GLORY WHAT
1455-138263-0002 SOME TWELVE MILES OTHERS THIRTY MILES BROAD
1455-138263-0003 AND SEEMED TO COVER PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE EAST THE NORTHEAST AND THE NORTH THE HALF OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE ONE OF THESE JETS EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE CIRCLE OF NEANDER SITUATED ON THE FORTIETH MERIDIAN
1455-138263-0004 ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
1455-138263-0005 WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
1455-138263-0006 THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
1455-138263-0007 BECAUSE THE REGULARITY OF THESE LUMINOUS LINES AND THE VIOLENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY VOLCANIC MATTER TO SUCH DISTANCES IS INEXPLICABLE
1455-138263-0008 BY JOVE REPLIED MICHEL ARDAN
1455-138263-0009 INDEED SAID BARBICANE INDEED CONTINUED MICHEL IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY
1455-138263-0010 WELL REPLIED BARBICANE SMILING AND WHAT HAND WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO THROW A BALL TO GIVE SUCH A SHOCK AS THAT THE HAND IS NOT NECESSARY ANSWERED NICHOLL NOT AT ALL CONFOUNDED
1455-138263-0011 THE SHOCK WHICH PRODUCED THAT RENT
1455-138263-0012 A CONTRACTION SOMETHING LIKE A LUNAR STOMACH ACHE SAID MICHEL ARDAN BESIDES ADDED BARBICANE THIS OPINION IS THAT OF AN ENGLISH SAVANT
1455-138263-0013 THAT NASMYTH WAS NO FOOL REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0014 THEIR PROJECTILE SATURATED WITH LUMINOUS GLEAMS IN THE DOUBLE IRRADIATION OF SUN AND MOON MUST HAVE APPEARED LIKE AN INCANDESCENT GLOBE
1455-138263-0015 TO INTENSE HEAT NATURE WAS THUS PREPARING THEM TO BECOME SELENITES BECOME SELENITES THAT IDEA BROUGHT UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON AFTER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN COULD THE TRAVELERS SOLVE IT
1455-138263-0016 WOULD THEY DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST IT MICHEL ARDAN PERSUADED HIS TWO FRIENDS TO FORM AN OPINION AND ASKED THEM DIRECTLY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE LUNAR WORLD
1455-138263-0017 I THINK THAT WE CAN ANSWER SAID BARBICANE BUT ACCORDING TO MY IDEA THE QUESTION OUGHT NOT TO BE PUT IN THAT FORM I ASK IT TO BE PUT DIFFERENTLY PUT IT YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0018 HERE IT IS CONTINUED BARBICANE THE PROBLEM IS A DOUBLE ONE AND REQUIRES A DOUBLE SOLUTION IS THE MOON HABITABLE HAS THE MOON EVER BEEN INHABITABLE GOOD
1455-138263-0019 REPLIED NICHOLL FIRST LET US SEE WHETHER THE MOON IS HABITABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT ANSWERED MICHEL AND I ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0020 IN HER ACTUAL STATE WITH HER SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE CERTAINLY VERY MUCH REDUCED HER SEAS FOR THE MOST PART DRIED UP HER INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF WATER RESTRICTED VEGETATION SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS OF COLD AND HEAT
1455-138263-0021 HER DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS THE MOON DOES NOT SEEM HABITABLE TO ME NOR DOES SHE SEEM PROPITIOUS TO ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT NOR SUFFICIENT FOR THE WANTS OF EXISTENCE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
1455-138263-0022 AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
1455-138263-0023 SEEMED TO US TO MOVE ON THE MOON'S SURFACE
1455-138263-0024 AND WHAT HAVE WE SEEN EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS THE GEOLOGICAL WORKS OF NATURE NEVER THE WORK OF MAN IF THEN THERE EXIST REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM ON THE MOON
1455-138263-0025 THEY MUST HAVE FLED TO THOSE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES WHICH THE EYE CANNOT REACH WHICH I CANNOT ADMIT FOR THEY MUST HAVE LEFT TRACES OF THEIR PASSAGE ON THOSE PLAINS WHICH THE ATMOSPHERE MUST COVER HOWEVER SLIGHTLY RAISED IT MAY BE
1455-138263-0026 THESE TRACES ARE NOWHERE VISIBLE THERE REMAINS BUT ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT OF A LIVING RACE TO WHICH MOTION WHICH IS LIFE IS FOREIGN ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY LIVING CREATURES WHICH DO NOT LIVE REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0027 THE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTILE OF THE GUN CLUB AFTER HAVING FOUNDED THEIR ARGUMENT ON FACTS RECENTLY OBSERVED DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY UPON THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON NO THE MOON
1455-138263-0028 SAID NICHOLL LET US ATTACK THE SECOND QUESTION AN INDISPENSABLE COMPLEMENT OF THE FIRST I ASK THE HONORABLE COMMISSION IF THE MOON IS NOT HABITABLE HAS SHE EVER BEEN INHABITED CITIZEN BARBICANE
1455-138263-0029 MY FRIENDS REPLIED BARBICANE I DID NOT UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY IN ORDER TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE PAST HABITABILITY OF OUR SATELLITE BUT I WILL ADD THAT OUR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ONLY CONFIRM ME IN THIS OPINION
1455-138263-0030 I BELIEVE INDEED I AFFIRM THAT THE MOON HAS BEEN INHABITED BY A HUMAN RACE ORGANIZED LIKE OUR OWN THAT SHE HAS PRODUCED ANIMALS ANATOMICALLY FORMED LIKE THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
1455-138263-0031 BUT I ADD THAT THESE RACES HUMAN AND ANIMAL HAVE HAD THEIR DAY AND ARE NOW FOREVER EXTINCT
1455-138263-0032 RELATIVELY THE ORGANIZING FORCE OF MATTER HAS BEEN MUCH MORE VIOLENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MOON THAN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THIS CRACKED TWISTED AND BURST DISC ABUNDANTLY PROVES THIS
1455-138263-0033 THE MOON AND THE EARTH WERE NOTHING BUT GASEOUS MASSES ORIGINALLY
1455-138263-0034 CONTINUED BARBICANE AN ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDED IT
1455-138263-0035 FOR EXAMPLE ITS DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AT THE TERRESTRIAL POLES THEY LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MICHEL AN ARGUMENT OF LITTLE VALUE SINCE THE POLES ARE NOT INHABITED LET US OBSERVE MY FRIENDS CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0036 THAT IF IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE MOON ITS LONG NIGHTS AND LONG DAYS CREATED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE INSUPPORTABLE TO ORGANIZATION IT WAS NOT SO AT THE HISTORICAL PERIOD OF TIME THE ATMOSPHERE ENVELOPED THE DISC WITH A FLUID MANTLE
1455-138263-0037 VAPOR DEPOSITED ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF CLOUDS THIS NATURAL SCREEN TEMPERED THE ARDOR OF THE SOLAR RAYS AND RETAINED THE NOCTURNAL RADIATION
1455-138263-0038 LIGHT LIKE HEAT CAN DIFFUSE ITSELF IN THE AIR HENCE AN EQUALITY BETWEEN THE INFLUENCES WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS NOW THAT ATMOSPHERE HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED AND NOW I AM GOING TO ASTONISH YOU
1455-138263-0039 ASTONISH US SAID MICHEL ARDAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE MOON WAS INHABITED THE NIGHTS AND DAYS DID NOT LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND WHY
1455-138263-0040 ASKED NICHOLL QUICKLY BECAUSE MOST PROBABLY THEN THE ROTARY MOTION OF THE MOON UPON HER AXIS WAS NOT EQUAL TO HER REVOLUTION AN EQUALITY WHICH PRESENTS EACH PART OF HER DISC DURING FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE ACTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS
1455-138263-0041 GRANTED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT WHY SHOULD NOT THESE TWO MOTIONS HAVE BEEN EQUAL AS THEY ARE REALLY SO BECAUSE THAT EQUALITY HAS ONLY BEEN DETERMINED BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION
1455-138263-0042 AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THIS ATTRACTION WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ALTER THE MOTION OF THE MOON AT THAT PERIOD WHEN THE EARTH WAS STILL FLUID JUST SO REPLIED NICHOLL AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THE MOON HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SATELLITE OF THE EARTH
1455-138263-0043 EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
1455-138263-0044 THOSE SPECULATIONS ARE TOO HIGH SAID HE PROBLEMS UTTERLY INSOLUBLE
1455-138263-0045 LET US ONLY ADMIT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMORDIAL ATTRACTION AND THEN BY THE INEQUALITY OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
1455-138263-0046 BESIDES EVEN WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS LIFE WAS POSSIBLE AND SO ASKED MICHEL ARDAN HUMANITY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOON YES REPLIED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0047 AFTER HAVING DOUBTLESS REMAINED PERSISTENTLY FOR MILLIONS OF CENTURIES
1455-138263-0048 AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
1455-138263-0049 AND THE INCANDESCENT MATTER CONCENTRATED ITSELF THE LUNAR CRUST COOLED BY DEGREES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PHENOMENA SHOWED THEMSELVES IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ORGANIZED BEINGS AND BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VEGETATION SOON THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RAREFIED
1455-138263-0050 PROBABLY WITHDRAWN BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION THEN AERIAL DEPARTURE OF RESPIRABLE AIR AND DISAPPEARANCE OF WATER BY MEANS OF EVAPORATION AT THIS PERIOD THE MOON BECOMING UNINHABITABLE WAS NO LONGER INHABITED IT WAS A DEAD WORLD
1455-138263-0051 AND HAVE THEY CALCULATED THE TIME WHICH OUR UNFORTUNATE SPHERE WILL TAKE TO COOL CERTAINLY AND YOU KNOW THESE CALCULATIONS PERFECTLY
1455-138263-0052 BUT SPEAK THEN MY CLUMSY SAVANT EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN FOR YOU MAKE ME BOIL WITH IMPATIENCE VERY WELL MY GOOD MICHEL REPLIED BARBICANE QUIETLY WE KNOW WHAT DIMINUTION OF TEMPERATURE THE EARTH UNDERGOES IN THE LAPSE OF A CENTURY
1455-138263-0053 BE BROUGHT DOWN TO ZERO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS EXCLAIMED MICHEL AH I BREATHE AGAIN REALLY I WAS FRIGHTENED TO HEAR YOU I IMAGINED THAT WE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS TO LIVE
1455-138263-0054 BARBICANE AND NICHOLL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THEIR COMPANION'S UNEASINESS
1455-138263-0055 WHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED AGAIN HAS THE MOON BEEN INHABITED HE ASKED THE ANSWER WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT DURING THIS DISCUSSION FRUITFUL IN SOMEWHAT HAZARDOUS THEORIES
1455-138263-0056 THE PROJECTILE WAS RAPIDLY LEAVING THE MOON THE LINEAMENTS FADED AWAY FROM THE TRAVELERS EYES MOUNTAINS WERE CONFUSED IN THE DISTANCE AND OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STRANGE AND FANTASTICAL FORM OF THE EARTH'S SATELLITE THERE SOON REMAINED NOTHING
8238-283452-0000 INTRODUCTION THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS DISTINCTLY A MODERN CHARACTER IN EARLY LITERATURE WRAITHS TOOK THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
8238-283452-0001 AND INSISTED ON A PROPER SHOW OF RESPECTFUL FEAR ON THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY HONORED BY HAUNTING A MORTAL WAS EXPECTED TO RISE WHEN A GHOST ENTERED THE ROOM AND IN CASE HE WAS SLOW ABOUT IT
8238-283452-0002 HIS SPINE GAVE NOTICE OF WHAT ETIQUETTE DEMANDED IN THE EVENT OF OUTDOOR APPARITION IF A MAN FAILED TO BARE HIS HEAD IN AWE THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR REMINDED HIM OF HIS REMISSNESS
8238-283452-0003 IN THAT HER LOCKS BEING LONG AND PINNED UP ARE LESS EASILY MOVED WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE FACT IF IT BE A FACT THAT IN FICTION WOMEN HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES MORE SELF POSSESSED
8238-283452-0004 WHILE THE FEMININE CAN BE SEEN THROUGH BY ANOTHER WOMAN AND THUS DISARMED THE MAJORITY OF THE COMIC APPARITIONS CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ARE MASCULINE YOU DON'T OFTEN FIND WOMEN WRAITHED IN SMILES
8238-283452-0005 AND HAVE CHIVALROUSLY SPARED THE GENTLER SHADES AND THERE ARE VERY FEW FUNNY CHILD GHOSTS YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY NONE IN COMPARISON WITH THE NUMBER OF GROWN UPS
8238-283452-0006 THE NUMBER OF GHOST CHILDREN OF ANY OR ALL TYPES IS SMALL PROPORTIONATELY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT SEEMS AN UNNATURAL THING FOR A CHILD TO DIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
8238-283452-0007 THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES AS IN THE CASE OF THE GHOST BABY MENTIONED LATER BUT VERY FEW ANCIENT GHOSTS WERE A LONG FACED LOT
8238-283452-0008 SINCE ANY LIVING PERSON HOWEVER SENILE WOULD BE THOUGHT JUVENILE COMPARED WITH A TIMELESS SPOOK BUT IN THESE DAYS OF INDIVIDUALISM AND RADICAL LIBERALISM SPOOKS AS WELL AS MORTALS ARE EXPANDING THEIR PERSONALITIES
8238-283452-0009 AND INDULGING IN GREATER FREEDOM A GHOST CAN CALL HIS SHADE HIS OWN NOW AND EXHIBIT ANY MOOD HE PLEASES EVEN YOUNG FEMALE WRAITHS DEMANDING LATCHKEYS REFUSE TO OBEY THE FROWNING FACE OF THE CLOCK
8238-283452-0010 TO MAKE THE GHOST OF MISSUS GRUNDY TURN A SHADE PALER IN HORROR NOWADAYS HAUNTERS HAVE MORE FUN AND FREEDOM THAN THE HAUNTED IN FACT IT'S MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET THESE DAYS TO BE DEAD FOR GHOSTS HAVE NO RENT PROBLEMS
8238-283452-0011 MANIFESTLY DEATH HAS COMPENSATIONS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION THE MARVEL IS THAT APPARITIONS WERE SO LONG IN REALIZING THEIR POSSIBILITIES IN IMPROVING THEIR ADVANTAGES
8238-283452-0012 THE SPECTERS IN CLASSIC AND MEDIEVAL LITERATURE WERE MALARIAL VAPOROUS BEINGS WITHOUT ENERGY TO DO ANYTHING BUT THREATEN
8238-283452-0013 AT BEST A REVENANT COULD ONLY RATTLE A RUSTY SKELETON OR SHAKE A MOLDY SHROUD OR CLANK A CHAIN BUT AS MORTALS COWERED BEFORE HIS DEMONSTRATIONS HE DIDN'T WORRY
8238-283452-0014 THE UP TO DATE GHOST KEEPS HIS SKELETON IN A GARAGE OR SOME PLACE WHERE IT IS CLEANED AND OILED AND KEPT IN GOOD WORKING ORDER THE MODERN WRAITH HAS SOLD HIS SHEET TO THE OLD CLO'ES MAN AND DRESSES AS IN LIFE
8238-283452-0015 HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO WEAPON NO THREAT IN HORROR TO BE COMPARED WITH RIDICULE THINK WHAT A SOLEMN CREATURE THE GOTHIC GHOST WAS
8238-283452-0016 HOW LITTLE ORIGINALITY AND INITIATIVE HE SHOWED AND HOW DEPENDENT HE WAS ON HIS OWN ATMOSPHERE FOR THRILLS HIS SOLE APPEAL WAS TO THE SPINAL COLUMN THE GHOST OF TO DAY TOUCHES THE FUNNY BONE AS WELL
8238-283452-0017 MANY AMERICANS THERE ARE TO DAY WHO WOULD COURT BEING HAUNTED BY THE CAPTAIN AND CREW OF RICHARD MIDDLETON'S GHOST SHIP THAT LANDED IN A TURNIP FIELD AND DISPENSED DRINK TILL THEY DEMORALIZED THE DENIZENS OF VILLAGE AND GRAVEYARD ALIKE
8238-283452-0018 AFTER THAT SHOW OF SPIRITS THE TURNIPS IN THAT FIELD TASTED OF RUM LONG AFTER THE GHOST SHIP HAD SAILED AWAY INTO THE BLUE THE MODERN SPOOK IS POSSESSED NOT ONLY OF HUMOR BUT OF A CAUSTIC SATIRE AS WELL
8238-283452-0019 HIS JEST IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE POINT TO IT AND HE CAN HAUNT SO INSIDIOUSLY CAN MAKE HIMSELF SO AT HOME IN HIS HOST'S STUDY OR BEDROOM THAT A MAN ACTUALLY WELCOMES A CHAT WITH HIM
8238-283452-0020 A GHOST MOREOVER THAT TOWERED AND SWELLED AT EVERY HACKNEYED PHRASE TILL FINALLY HE FILLED THE ROOM AND BURST AFTER THE YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO HIS ADMIRED ONE AND MADE SUBSEQUENT REMARKS
8238-283452-0021 GHOSTS NOT ONLY HAVE APPALLINGLY LONG MEMORIES BUT THEY POSSESS A MEAN ADVANTAGE OVER THE LIVING IN THAT THEY HAVE ONCE BEEN MORTAL
8238-283452-0022 THE MODERN HUMOROUS GHOST SATIRIZES EVERYTHING FROM THE OLD FASHIONED SPECTER HE'S VERY FOND OF TAKING POT SHOTS AT HIM TO THE LATEST PSYCHIC MANIFESTATIONS
8238-283452-0023 HE LAUGHS AT GHOSTS THAT AREN'T EXPERTS IN EFFICIENCY HAUNTING AND HE HAS A LOT OF FUN OUT OF MORTALS FOR BEING SCARED OF SPECTERS HE LOVES TO SHAKE THE LUGUBRIOUS TERRORS OF THE PAST BEFORE YOU
8238-283452-0024 AND USES THE OLD THRILLS ONLY TO SHOW WHAT DEAD BATTERIES THEY COME FROM HIS REALLY ELECTRICAL EFFECTS ARE HIS OWN INVENTIONS HE NEEDS NO DUNGEON KEEPS AND MONKISH CELLS TO PLAY ABOUT IN NOT HE
8238-283452-0025 HE DEMANDS NO RAG NOR BONE NOR CLANK OF CHAIN OF HIS OLD EQUIPMENT TO START ON HIS CAREER HE CAN START UP A MOVING PICTURE SHOW OF HIS OWN AS IN RUTH MC ENERY STUART'S THE HAUNTED PHOTOGRAPH
8238-283452-0026 AND DEMONSTRATE A NEW KIND OF APPARITION THE GHOST STORY OF TO DAY GIVES YOU SPINAL SENSATIONS WITH A DIFFERENCE AS IN THE IMMORTAL TRANSFERRED GHOST BY FRANK R STOCKTON
8238-283452-0027 WHERE THE SUITOR ON THE MOONLIT PORCH ATTEMPTING TO TELL HIS FAIR ONE THAT HE DOTES ON HER SEES THE GHOST OF HER FEROCIOUS UNCLE WHO ISN'T DEAD
8238-283452-0028 KICKING HIS HEELS AGAINST THE RAILING AND HEARS HIS ADMONITION THAT HE'D BETTER HURRY UP AS THE LIVE UNCLE IS COMING IN SIGHT
8238-283452-0029 HAS NEVER BEEN A GHOST NOR USED A WOODEN LEG BUT A TERRIFYING LEG ACY WHILE YOU DO BELIEVE IN IT THE NEW GHOST HAS A MORE NIMBLE AND VERSATILE TONGUE AS WELL AS WIT
8238-283452-0030 IN THE OLDER FICTION AND DRAMA APPARITIONS SPOKE SELDOM
8238-283452-0031 AND GHOSTS LIKE KINGS IN DRAMA WERE OF A DIGNITY AND MUST PRESERVE IT IN THEIR SPEECH OR PERHAPS THE AUTHORS WERE DOUBTFUL AS TO THE DIALOGUE OF SHADES
8238-283452-0032 AND COMPROMISED ON A FEW STATELY EJACULATIONS AS BEING SAFELY PHANTASMAL SPEAKING PARTS BUT COMPARE THAT USAGE WITH THE RUDE FREEDOM OF SOME MODERN SPOOKS
8238-283452-0033 THINK OF HAVING ALWAYS AND ALWAYS TO SPEAK A DEAD LANGUAGE THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS NOT ONLY MODERN BUT HE IS DISTINCTIVELY AMERICAN THERE ARE GHOSTS OF ALL NATIONALITIES NATURALLY
8238-283452-0034 BUT THE SPOOK THAT PROVIDES A JOKE ON HIS HOST OR ON HIMSELF IS YANKEE IN ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT THE DRY HUMOR THE COMIC SENSE OF THE INCONGRUOUS THE WILLINGNESS TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF AS AT OTHERS
8238-283452-0035 AND ARE PRESERVED IN THEIR TRUE FLAVOR I DON'T ASSERT OF COURSE
8238-283452-0036 THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH SELECTIONS IN THIS VOLUME ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE CONTRARY
8238-283452-0037 THERE ARE VARIOUS ENGLISH STORIES OF WHIMSICAL HAUNTING SOME OF ACTUAL SPOOKS AND SOME OF THE HOAX TYPE HOAX GHOSTS ARE FAIRLY NUMEROUS IN BRITISH AS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE
8238-283452-0038 OF THE EARLY SPECIMENS OF THE REALLY AMUSING GHOST THAT IS AN ACTUAL REVENANT IS THE GHOST BABY IN BLACKWOOD'S WHICH SHOWS ORIGINALITY AND HUMOR YET IS TOO DIFFUSE FOR PRINTING HERE
8238-283452-0039 IN THAT WE HAVE A CONVENTIONAL YOUNG BACHELOR ENGAGED TO A CHARMING GIRL WHO IS ENTANGLED IN SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS AND MADE TO SUFFER MENTAL TORMENT BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
8238-283452-0040 TILL THE PHANTOM COUPLE TAKE A LIKING TO EACH OTHER AND DECIDE TO LET THE LIVING BURY THEIR DEAD THIS IS SUGGESTIVE OF BRANDER MATTHEWS'S EARLIER AND CLEVERER STORY OF A SPECTRAL COURTSHIP IN THE RIVAL GHOSTS
8238-283452-0041 MEDIEVAL AND LATER LITERATURE GAVE US MANY INSTANCES OF A LOVE AFFAIR OR MARRIAGE BETWEEN ONE SPIRIT AND ONE MORTAL
8238-283452-0042 SHOW THE DIVERSITY OF THE ENGLISH HUMOR AS ASSOCIATED WITH APPARITIONS AND ARE ENTERTAINING IN THEMSELVES THE CANTERVILLE GHOST BY OSCAR WILDE IS ONE OF HIS BEST SHORT STORIES
8238-283452-0043 THIS TRAVESTY ON THE CONVENTIONAL TRADITIONS OF THE WRAITH IS PREPOSTEROUSLY DELIGHTFUL ONE OF THE CLEVEREST GHOST STORIES IN OUR LANGUAGE ZANGWILL HAS WRITTEN ENGAGINGLY OF SPOOKS
8238-283452-0044 FRANK R STOCKTON GAVE HIS TO FUNNY SPOOKS WITH A RIOTOUS AND LAUGHING PEN THE SPIRIT IN HIS TRANSFERRED GHOST IS IMPUDENTLY DEATHLESS AND HAS CALLED UP A TRAIN OF SUBSEQUENT HAUNTERS
8238-283452-0045 JOHN KENDRICK BANGS HAS MADE THE DARKER REGIONS SEEM COMFORTABLE AND HOMELIKE FOR US AND HAS CREATED GHOSTS SO HUMAN AND SO FUNNY THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ONE OR MORE
8238-283452-0046 WE FEEL DOWNRIGHT NEIGHBORLY TOWARD SUCH SPECTERS AS THE FUTILE LAST GHOST NELSON LLOYD EVOKES FOR US AS WE APPRECIATE THE SATIRE OF ROSE O'NEILL'S SOPHISTICATED WRAITH
8238-283452-0047 THE FIELD IS STILL COMPARATIVELY LIMITED BUT A NUMBER OF AMERICANS HAVE DONE DISTINCTIVE WORK IN IT THE SPECTER NOW WEARS MOTLEY INSTEAD OF A SHROUD
8123-275209-0000 THE BUTTERFLY'S CHILDREN BY MISSUS ALFRED GATTY LET ME HIRE YOU AS A NURSE FOR MY POOR CHILDREN SAID A BUTTERFLY TO A QUIET CATERPILLAR WHO WAS STROLLING ALONG A CABBAGE LEAF IN HER
8123-275209-0001 WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF MY BABY BUTTERFLIES WHEN I AM GONE WILL YOU KIND MILD GREEN CATERPILLAR BUT YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU GIVE THEM TO EAT CATERPILLAR THEY CANNOT OF COURSE LIVE ON YOUR ROUGH FOOD
8123-275209-0002 YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
8123-275209-0003 DEAR ME IT IS A SAD PITY YOU CANNOT FLY YOURSELF BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER NURSE NOW SO YOU WILL DO YOUR BEST I HOPE DEAR DEAR
8123-275209-0004 AND WITH THESE WORDS THE BUTTERFLY DROOPED HER WINGS AND DIED AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR WHO HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN SAYING YES OR NO TO THE REQUEST
8123-275209-0005 WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
8123-275209-0006 OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED A POOR CRAWLING CREATURE LIKE ME TO BRING UP HER DAINTY LITTLE ONES MUCH THEY'LL MIND ME TRULY WHEN THEY FEEL THE GAY WINGS ON THEIR BACKS AND CAN FLY AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT WHENEVER THEY CHOOSE
8123-275209-0007 HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
8123-275209-0008 SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
8123-275209-0009 WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
8123-275209-0010 SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR IN GREAT DISTRESS AND THEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF THE LARK AND SHE FANCIED THAT BECAUSE HE WENT UP SO HIGH AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WENT TO
8123-275209-0011 HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
8123-275209-0012 AND THE CATERPILLAR SENT A MESSAGE TO HIM TO BEG HIM TO COME AND TALK TO HER AND WHEN HE CAME SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER DIFFICULTIES AND ASKED HIM WHAT SHE WAS TO DO TO FEED AND REAR THE LITTLE CREATURES SO DIFFERENT FROM HERSELF
8123-275209-0013 PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
8123-275209-0014 SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
8123-275209-0015 SO SHE RESUMED HER WALK ROUND THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS NIBBLING A BIT OF THE CABBAGE LEAF NOW AND THEN AS SHE MOVED ALONG
8123-275209-0016 I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
8123-275209-0017 DEW AND THE HONEY OUT OF FLOWERS I AM AFRAID SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR NO SUCH THING OLD LADY SOMETHING SIMPLER THAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET AT QUITE EASILY
8123-275209-0018 NEVER SAID THE CATERPILLAR INDIGNANTLY IT WAS THEIR DYING MOTHER'S LAST REQUEST THAT I SHOULD DO NO SUCH THING THEIR DYING MOTHER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER PERSISTED THE LARK
8123-275209-0019 BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME AND THEN DISBELIEVE WHAT I SAY YOU HAVE NEITHER FAITH NOR TRUST OH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD SAID THE CATERPILLAR NAY BUT YOU DO NOT REPLIED THE LARK YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME EVEN ABOUT THE FOOD
8123-275209-0020 AND YET THAT IS BUT A BEGINNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY CATERPILLAR WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE LITTLE EGGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE BUTTERFLIES TO BE SURE SAID THE CATERPILLAR CATERPILLARS SANG THE LARK
8123-275209-0021 BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
8123-275209-0022 I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
8123-275209-0023 THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
8123-275209-0024 YOU JEST WITH MY INFERIORITY NOW YOU ARE CRUEL AS WELL AS FOOLISH
8123-275209-0025 I WILL ASK YOUR ADVICE NO MORE I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME CRIED THE LARK NETTLED IN HIS TURN I BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT I AM TOLD PERSISTED THE CATERPILLAR THAT IS
8123-275209-0026 I SEE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS I KNOW NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE MORE OH CATERPILLAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU CRAWL BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET BEYOND YOUR CABBAGE LEAF THAT YOU CALL ANY THING IMPOSSIBLE
8123-275209-0027 AS WELL AS YOU DO LOOK AT MY LONG GREEN BODY AND THESE ENDLESS LEGS AND THEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HAVING WINGS AND A PAINTED FEATHERY COAT FOOL AND FOOL YOU CRIED THE INDIGNANT LARK
8123-275209-0028 OH CATERPILLAR WHAT COMES TO YOU FROM THENCE RECEIVE AS I DO
8123-275209-0029 INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
8123-275209-0030 AND HAD ALREADY MADE A SHOW OF A HOLE IN THE CABBAGE LEAF THEY HAD BROKEN FROM THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS SHAME AND AMAZEMENT FILLED OUR GREEN FRIEND'S HEART BUT JOY SOON FOLLOWED
8123-275209-0031 FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
8123-275209-0032 AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
8123-275209-0033 AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
8123-275209-0034 AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID
8123-275216-0000 TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
8123-275216-0001 WE ARE ALL OAK TREES THEY SAID WE OWN THE LAND AND RULE OVER IT AND THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS THERE IN THOSE DAYS AND THOSE THAT THERE WERE WERE NOTHING BETTER THAN WILD ANIMALS
8123-275216-0002 THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
8123-275216-0003 ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
8123-275216-0004 SAID THE BEAR LICKING HIS PAWS THAT IS ALL THE SHADE YOU CAN GIVE AGAINST THE SUN IF YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH ME YOU CAN GO ANSWERED THE OAK PROUDLY
8123-275216-0005 I AM LORD IN THE LAND AND WHATEVER WAY YOU LOOK YOU FIND MY BROTHERS AND NOTHING ELSE TRUE MUTTERED THE BEAR THAT IS JUST WHAT IS SO SICKENING I HAVE BEEN FOR A LITTLE TOUR ABROAD I MAY TELL YOU AND AM JUST A LITTLE BIT SPOILT
8123-275216-0006 IT WAS IN A LAND DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE I TOOK A NAP UNDER THE BEECH TREES THEY ARE TALL SLIM TREES NOT CROOKED OLD THINGS LIKE YOU AND THEIR TOPS ARE SO DENSE THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP THROUGH THEM
8123-275216-0007 BUT I DON'T WANT TO CHATTER ANY MORE WITH YOU JUST NOW I HAVE HAD TO TROT A MILE ON ACCOUNT OF A CONFOUNDED HUNTER WHO STRUCK ME ON ONE OF MY HIND LEGS WITH AN ARROW NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SLEEP
8123-275216-0008 AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME AT PEACE SINCE YOU CANNOT GIVE ME SHADE THE BEAR STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT AND CLOSED HIS EYES BUT HE GOT NO SLEEP THAT TIME FOR THE OTHER TREES HAD HEARD HIS STORY
8123-275216-0009 WHAT KIND OF TREES CAN THEY BE WHOSE LEAVES SIT SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP BETWEEN THEM ASKED A LITTLE OAK WHO WAS LISTENING TO WHAT THE BIG ONES WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT BY HIS SIDE STOOD AN OLD GNARLED TREE
8123-275216-0010 WHO GAVE THE LITTLE OAK A CLOUT ON THE HEAD WITH ONE OF HIS LOWEST BOUGHS HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE SAID AND DON'T TALK TILL YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU NEED NONE OF YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF THE BEAR'S NONSENSE
8123-275216-0011 I WILL BRING SOME BEECH NUTS WITH ME AND I VOW YOU WILL ALL TURN YELLOW WITH JEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEE HOW PRETTY THE NEW TREES ARE THEN HE MADE OFF BUT THE OAKS TALKED THE WHOLE DAY LONG ONE TO ANOTHER ABOUT THE FUNNY TREES HE HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT
8123-275216-0012 IF THEY COME I WILL KILL THEM SAID THE LITTLE OAK TREE BUT DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS HE GOT ONE ON THE HEAD FROM THE OLD OAK IF THEY COME YOU SHALL TREAT THEM POLITELY YOU YOUNG DOG SAID HE BUT THEY WILL NOT COME
8123-275216-0013 BUT IN THIS THE OLD OAK WAS WRONG FOR THEY DID COME TOWARDS AUTUMN THE BEAR CAME BACK AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE OLD OAK MY FRIENDS DOWN THERE WISH ME TO PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS HE SAID
8123-275216-0014 AND HE PICKED SOME FUNNY THINGS OUT OF HIS SHAGGY COAT HERE YOU MAY SEE WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED THE OAK THAT IS BEECH ANSWERED THE BEAR THE BEECH NUTS WHICH I PROMISED YOU
8123-275216-0015 THEY KILLED MY WIFE AND ONE OF MY BROTHERS AND I MUST SEE ABOUT FINDING A PLACE WHERE I CAN LIVE IN PEACE THERE IS SCARCELY A SPOT LEFT WHERE A SELF RESPECTING BEAR CAN STAY GOODBYE YOU OLD GNARLED OAK TREES
8123-275216-0016 THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
8123-275216-0017 THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
8123-275216-0018 AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH
8123-275216-0019 THE SUN SHONE ON THEM AND THE RAIN FELL ON THEM SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY GREW TALL OH HOW PRETTY THEY ARE SAID THE GREAT OAK AND STOOPED HIS CROOKED BOUGHS STILL MORE SO THAT THEY COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF THEM
8123-275216-0020 YOU ARE WELCOME AMONG US SAID THE OLD OAK AND GRACIOUSLY INCLINED HIS HEAD TO THEM YOU SHALL BE MY FOSTER CHILDREN AND BE TREATED JUST AS WELL AS MY OWN THANKS SAID THE LITTLE BEECHES
8123-275216-0021 AND THEY SAID NO MORE BUT THE LITTLE OAK COULD NOT BEAR THE STRANGE TREES IT IS DREADFUL THE WAY YOU SHOOT UP INTO THE AIR HE SAID IN VEXATION YOU ARE ALREADY HALF AS TALL AS I AM BUT I BEG YOU TO TAKE NOTICE THAT I AM MUCH OLDER
8123-275216-0022 AND OF GOOD FAMILY BESIDES THE BEECHES LAUGHED WITH THEIR LITTLE TINY GREEN LEAVES BUT SAID NOTHING SHALL I BEND MY BRANCHES A LITTLE ASIDE SO THAT THE SUN CAN SHINE BETTER ON YOU THE OLD TREE ASKED POLITELY
8123-275216-0023 MANY THANKS ANSWERED THE BEECHES WE CAN GROW VERY NICELY IN THE SHADE AND THE WHOLE SUMMER PASSED BY AND ANOTHER SUMMER AFTER THAT AND STILL MORE SUMMERS THE BEECHES WENT ON GROWING
8123-275216-0024 AND AT LAST QUITE OVERTOPPED THE LITTLE OAK KEEP YOUR LEAVES TO YOURSELF CRIED THE OAK YOU OVERSHADOW ME AND THAT IS WHAT I CAN'T ENDURE I MUST HAVE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE
8123-275216-0025 THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
8123-275216-0026 A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
8123-275216-0027 YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING
8123-275216-0028 HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT WHEN A REGULAR STORM COMES I ASSURE YOU THE WIND GIVES ONE'S HEAD A GOOD SHAKING MY OLD BOUGHS HAVE CREAKED MANY A TIME AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BECOME OF THE FLIMSY FINERY THAT YOU STICK UP IN THE AIR
8123-275216-0029 EVERY ONE HAS HIS OWN MANNER OF GROWTH AND WE HAVE OURS ANSWERED THE YOUNG BEECHES THIS IS THE WAY IT'S DONE WHERE WE COME FROM AND WE ARE PERHAPS AS GOOD AS YOU ARE
8123-275216-0030 THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
8123-275216-0031 BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE YOUR LEAVES A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY BUDS ON MY LOWEST BRANCHES THIS YEAR YOU OVERSHADOW ME SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CONCERNS US ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8123-275216-0032 EVERY ONE HAS QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF IF HE IS EQUAL TO HIS WORK AND HAS LUCK IT TURNS OUT WELL FOR HIM IF NOT HE MUST BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE WALL THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD
8123-275216-0033 THEN THE OAK'S LOWEST BRANCH DIED AND HE BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED YOU ARE PRETTY THINGS HE SAID IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU REWARD ME FOR MY HOSPITALITY WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE I LET YOU GROW AT MY FEET
8123-275216-0034 AND SHELTERED YOU AGAINST THE STORM I LET THE SUN SHINE ON YOU AS MUCH AS EVER HE WOULD AND I TREATED YOU AS IF YOU WERE MY OWN CHILDREN AND IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS YOU STIFLE ME STUFF AND NONSENSE
8123-275216-0035 SAID THE BEECHES SO THEY PUT FORTH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND WHEN THE FRUIT WAS RIPE THE WIND SHOOK THE BOUGHS AND SCATTERED IT ROUND FAR AND WIDE YOU ARE QUICK PEOPLE LIKE ME SAID THE WIND I LIKE YOU FOR IT
8123-275216-0036 AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
8123-275216-0037 AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
8123-275216-0038 ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
8123-275216-0039 BUT THE OLD OAK GAZED SADLY OUT OVER THE WOOD THE LIGHT GREEN BEECH LEAVES WERE PEEPING OUT EVERYWHERE AND THE OAKS WERE SIGHING AND BEWAILING THEIR DISTRESS TO ONE ANOTHER
8123-275216-0040 THEY ARE TAKING OUR STRENGTH OUT OF US THEY SAID AND SHOOK AS MUCH AS THE BEECHES AROUND WOULD LET THEM THE LAND IS OURS NO LONGER ONE BOUGH DIED AFTER ANOTHER
8123-275216-0041 AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
8123-275216-0042 BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
8123-275216-0043 AT LAST WE GET A LITTLE APPRECIATION SAID THE OLD OAK BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR LIVES THEN HE SAID TO THE BEECH TREES WHAT WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I HELPED YOU ON IN YOUR YOUNG DAYS
8123-275216-0044 WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
8123-275216-0045 AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
3259-158083-0000 ADMINISTRATION TERRORISM THE ADMINISTRATION TRIED IN ANOTHER WAY TO STOP PICKETING
3259-158083-0001 THE AGITATION WOULD CERTAINLY WEAKEN SO THOUGHT THE ADMINISTRATION TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE HOWEVER IN THE FACE OF THAT RECKLESS AND EXTREME SENTENCE THE LONGEST PICKET LINE OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN FORMED AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER TENTH
3259-158083-0002 FORTY ONE WOMEN PICKETED IN PROTEST AGAINST THIS WANTON PERSECUTION OF THEIR LEADER AS WELL AS AGAINST THE DELAY IN PASSING THE AMENDMENT FACE TO FACE WITH AN EMBARRASSING NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE ADMINISTRATION USED ITS WITS AND DECIDED
3259-158083-0003 TO REDUCE THE NUMBER TO A MANAGEABLE SIZE BEFORE IMPRISONING THIS GROUP FAILING OF THAT THEY TRIED STILL ANOTHER WAY OUT THEY RESORTED TO IMPRISONMENT WITH TERRORISM
3259-158083-0004 IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW WIDELY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION THIS GROUP OF PICKETS WAS I GIVE ITS PERSONNEL COMPLETE FIRST GROUP NEW YORK MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN MISS BELLE SHEINBERG

3259-158083-0014 AS SHE SAID IN COURT WE TOOK THIS ACTION WITH GREAT CONSECRATION OF SPIRIT WITH WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE PERSONAL LIBERTY
3259-158083-0015 JUDGE MULLOWNY ADDRESSED THE PRISONERS WITH MANY HIGH SOUNDING WORDS ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND INADVERTENTLY SLIPPED INTO A DISCOURSE ON RUSSIA AND THE DANGERS OF REVOLUTION
3259-158083-0016 BUT THEIR MINDS WERE TOO FULL OF THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF OUR OFFENSE TO CONCEAL IT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN POWER TO MEET IT THE JUDGE LAMENTED IT IS VERY VERY PUZZLING I FIND YOU GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED
3259-158083-0017 BUT WILL TAKE THE MATTER OF SENTENCE UNDER ADVISEMENT AND SO THE GUILTY PICKETS WERE SUMMARILY RELEASED THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT RELISH THE INCARCERATION OF FORTY ONE WOMEN FOR ANOTHER REASON THAN LIMITED HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS
3259-158083-0018 FORTY ONE WOMEN REPRESENTING SIXTEEN STATES IN THE UNION MIGHT CREATE A CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL DISLOCATION BUT THESE SAME FORTY ONE WOMEN WERE DETERMINED TO FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE ITS CHOICE IT COULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR PEACEFUL AGITATION
3259-158083-0019 OR IT COULD STAND THE REACTION WHICH WAS BOUND TO COME FROM IMPRISONING THEM AND SO THE FORTY ONE WOMEN RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES TO RESUME THEIR PICKETING THEY STOOD GUARD SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THE POLICE TAKEN UNAWARES COULD SUMMON SUFFICIENT FORCE TO ARREST THEM
3259-158083-0020 COME BACK ON FRIDAY I AM NOT YET PREPARED TO TRY THE CASE LOGIC DICTATED THAT EITHER WE HAD A RIGHT TO STAND AT THE GATES WITH OUR BANNERS OR WE DID NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT
3259-158083-0021 IT HAD TO STOP PICKETING WHETHER THIS WAS DONE LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY LOGICALLY OR ILLOGICALLY CLUMSILY OR DEXTEROUSLY WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE PICKETING MUST BE STOPPED
3259-158083-0022 USING THEIR WELCOME RELEASE TO CONTINUE THEIR PROTEST THE WOMEN AGAIN MARCHED WITH THEIR BANNERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICKET AGAIN THEY WERE ARRESTED NO ONE WHO SAW THAT LINE WILL EVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION IT MADE NOT ONLY ON FRIENDS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
3259-158083-0023 BUT ON THE GENERAL POPULACE OF WASHINGTON TO SEE THESE WOMEN FORCE WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENT DEFIANCE THE HAND OF A WAVERING ADMINISTRATION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
3259-158083-0024 MISS BURNS RECEIVED SIX MONTHS IN PRONOUNCING THE LIGHTEST SENTENCE UPON MISSUS NOLAN THE JUDGE SAID THAT HE DID SO ON ACCOUNT OF HER AGE HE URGED HER HOWEVER TO PAY HER FINE HINTING THAT JAIL MIGHT BE TOO SEVERE ON HER AND MIGHT BRING ON DEATH
3259-158083-0025 AT THIS SUGGESTION TINY MISSUS NOLAN PULLED HERSELF UP ON HER TOES AND SAID WITH GREAT DIGNITY
3259-158083-0026 I HAVE A NEPHEW FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY IN FRANCE
3259-158083-0027 I SHOULD BE ASHAMED IF I DID NOT JOIN THESE BRAVE WOMEN IN THEIR FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA I SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE HONOR TO DIE IN PRISON

3259-158083-0074 EACH ONE WAS CALLED TO THE MAT AND INTERROGATED WILL YOU WORK WILL YOU PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WILL YOU EAT WILL YOU STOP PICKETING WILL YOU GO WITHOUT PAYING YOUR FINE AND PROMISE NEVER TO PICKET AGAIN
3259-158083-0075 HOW BAFFLED HE MUST HAVE BEEN THE ANSWER WAS DEFINITE AND FINAL THEIR RESISTANCE WAS SUPERB ONE OF THE FEW WARNING INCIDENTS DURING THE GRAY DAYS OF OUR IMPRISONMENT
3259-158083-0076 WAS THE UNEXPECTED SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT DOCTORS
3259-158083-0077 I HAVE SEEN WOMEN IN RUSSIA UNDERGO EXTREME SUFFERING FOR THEIR IDEALS BUT UNLESS I HAD SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES
3259-158083-0078 MY SISTER HUNGER STRUCK IN RUSSIA WHERE SHE WAS IMPRISONED FOR REFUSING TO REVEAL THE WHEREABOUTS OF TWO OF HER FRIENDS INDICTED FOR A GOVERNMENT OFFENSE SHE WAS FED AFTER THREE DAYS
3259-158083-0079 YOU GIRLS ARE ON YOUR NINTH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE AND YOUR CONDITION IS CRITICAL IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SUCH WOMEN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THIS TREATMENT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR POINT
3259-158083-0080 AND FORCE THE HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT
3259-158083-0081 TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRESIDENT AND ASK FOR A SPECIAL ORDER TO VISIT HER DAUGHTER FAILING TO SECURE THIS SHE WENT DAILY TO MISTER TUMULTY'S OFFICE ASKING IF HE HIMSELF WOULD NOT INTERCEDE FOR HER
3259-158083-0082 THE STORIES OF THE INHUMAN TREATMENT AT OCCOQUAN WERE FALSE AND THAT SHE MUST NOT BELIEVE THEM FINALLY MISSUS YOUNG PLEADED TO BE ALLOWED TO SEND ADDITIONAL WARM CLOTHING TO HER DAUGHTER WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE TOO LIGHTLY CLAD FOR THE VIGOROUS TEMPERATURE OF NOVEMBER
3259-158083-0083 MISTER TUMULTY ASSURED HER THAT THE WOMEN WERE PROPERLY CLOTHED AND REFUSED TO PERMIT THE CLOTHING TO BE SENT THE SUBSEQUENT STORIES OF THE WOMEN SHOWED WHAT AGONIES THEY HAD ENDURED BECAUSE THEY WERE INADEQUATELY CLAD FROM THE DAMPNESS OF THE CELLS INTO WHICH THEY WERE THROWN
3259-158083-0084 MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN WAS AMONG THE WOMEN WHO ENDURED THE NIGHT OF TERROR MISSUS BRANNAN IS THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLES A DANA FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK SUN AND THAT GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT OF LIBERTY WHO WAS A TRUSTED ASSOCIATE AND COUNSELOR
3259-158083-0085 OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN MISSUS BRANNAN LIFE LONG SUFFRAGIST IS AN ARISTOCRAT OF INTELLECT AND FEELING WHO HAS ALWAYS ALLIED HERSELF WITH LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENTS THIS WAS HER SECOND TERM OF IMPRISONMENT
3259-158083-0086 SHE WROTE A COMPREHENSIVE AFFIDAVIT OF HER EXPERIENCE AFTER NARRATING THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE ATTACK SHE CONTINUES SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER THEN SHOUTED OUT IN A LOUD TONE OF VOICE
3259-158083-0087 SEIZE THESE WOMEN TAKE THEM OFF THAT ONE THAT ONE TAKE HER OFF THE GUARDS RUSHED FORWARD AND AN ALMOST INDESCRIBABLE SCENE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION ENSUED I SAW ONE OF THE GUARDS SEIZE HER LUCY BURNS
3259-158083-0088 BY THE ARMS TWIST OR FORCE THEM BACK OF HER
3259-158083-0089 AND PUT IT ON IN ORDER TO PREPARE MYSELF IF ATTACKED I WAS TREMBLING AT THE TIME AND WAS STUNNED WITH TERROR AT THE SITUATION AS IT HAD DEVELOPED AND SAID TO THE SUPERINTENDENT I WILL GIVE MY NAME UNDER PROTEST AND STARTED TO WALK TOWARDS THE DESK WHEREON LAY THE BOOKS THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOUTED TO ME
3259-158083-0090 I SAW THE GUARDS SEIZING THE DIFFERENT WOMEN OF THE PARTY WITH THE UTMOST VIOLENCE THE FURNITURE BEING OVERTURNED AND THE ROOM A SCENE OF THE UTMOST DISTURBANCE
3259-158083-0091 I SAW MISS LINCOLN LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF HAVING JUST BEEN THROWN DOWN BY THE TWO GUARDS WHO WERE STANDING OVER HER IN A MENACING ATTITUDE SEEING THE GENERAL DISTURBANCE
3259-158083-0092 I GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF GIVING MY NAME AT THE DESK AND INSTINCTIVELY JOINED MY COMPANIONS TO GO WITH THEM AND SHARE WHATEVER WAS IN STORE FOR THEM THE WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN WERE THROWN DRAGGED OR HERDED OUT OF THE OFFICE ON TO THE PORCH DOWN THE STEPS TO THE GROUND AND FORCED TO CROSS THE ROAD
3259-158083-0093 TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING DURING ALL OF THIS TIME SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER WAS DIRECTING THE WHOLE ATTACK ALL OF US WERE THROWN INTO DIFFERENT CELLS IN THE MEN'S PRISON I BEING PUT IN ONE WITH FOUR OTHER WOMEN THE CELL CONTAINING A NARROW BED
3259-158083-0094 AND ONE CHAIR WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED DURING THE TIME THAT WE WERE BEING FORCED INTO THE CELLS THE GUARDS KEPT UP AN UPROAR SHOUTING BANGING THE IRON DOORS CLANGING BARS MAKING A TERRIFYING NOISE
3259-158083-0095 I AND ONE OF MY COMPANIONS WERE LYING DOWN ON THE NARROW BED ON WHICH WERE A BLANKET AND ONE PILLOW THE DOOR OF THE CELL WAS OPENED AND A MATTRESS AND A BLANKET BEING THROWN IN THE DOOR WAS VIOLENTLY BANGED TO
3259-158083-0096 AND LAY DOWN COVERING THEMSELVES WITH THE BLANKET I LOOKED ACROSS THE CORRIDOR AND SAW MISS LINCOLN AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WAS ALL RIGHT BEING ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN HURT BY THE TREATMENT IN THE OFFICE BUILDING INSTANTLY SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER RUSHED FORWARD SHOUTING AT ME
3259-158083-0097 GAG YOU AND PUT YOU IN A STRAITJACKET I WISH TO STATE AGAIN THAT THE CELLS INTO WHICH WE WERE PUT WERE SITUATED IN THE MEN'S PRISON
3259-158083-0098 AND WHO COULD AT ANY MOMENT LOOK AT US FURTHERMORE THE WATER CLOSETS WERE IN FULL VIEW OF THE CORRIDOR WHERE SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER AND THE GUARDS WERE MOVING ABOUT THE FLUSHING OF THESE CLOSETS COULD ONLY BE DONE FROM THE CORRIDOR AND WE WERE FORCED TO ASK THE GUARDS TO DO THIS FOR US
3259-158083-0099 THE MEN WHO HAD SHORTLY BEFORE ATTACKED US
3259-158083-0100 I WAS EXHAUSTED BY WHAT I HAD SEEN AND BEEN THROUGH AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN ABSOLUTE TERROR OF FURTHER ATTACK AND OF WHAT MIGHT STILL BE IN STORE FOR US I THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE WITH US AND FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY THE GUARDS ACTED BRUTAL IN THE EXTREME
3259-158083-0101 INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED
3259-158083-0102 AND THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT THE MATRON AND GUARDS WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO ACT TOWARDS US AS THEY HAD ACTED UNLESS THEY RELIED UPON THE SUPPORT OF HIGHER AUTHORITIES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE FROM THE TIME WE REACHED THE WORKHOUSE TO TERRORIZE US AND MY FEAR
3259-158083-0103 LEST THE EXTREME OF OUTRAGE WOULD BE WORKED UPON THE YOUNG GIRLS OF OUR PARTY BECAME INTENSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE TERROR OF THAT NIGHT
3259-158083-0104 THE AFFIDAVIT THEN CONTINUES WITH THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS BRANNAN WAS COMPELLED THE FOLLOWING MORNING TO PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WAS GIVEN A CUP OF SKIMMED MILK AND A SLICE OF TOAST
3259-158083-0105 AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO LIE DOWN FEELING SO ILL I COULD NOT SLEEP HAVING A SENSE OF CONSTANT DANGER I WAS ALMOST PARALYZED AND IN WRETCHED PHYSICAL CONDITION
3259-158083-0106 SEVEN OF US BEING IN THE PARTY WE WERE SO EXHAUSTED AND WEARY THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO STOP CONSTANTLY TO REST ON OUR WAY BACK FROM THE WALK WE HEARD THE BAYING OF HOUNDS VERY NEAR US IN THE WOODS THE MATRON SAID
3259-158083-0107 ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
3259-158083-0108 AND THIS WENT ON UNTIL WE REACHED THE SEWING ROOM THE EFFECT OF THIS UPON OUR NERVES CAN BETTER BE IMAGINED THAN DESCRIBED EVERY CONCEIVABLE LIE WAS TRIED IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE THE WOMEN TO ABANDON THEIR VARIOUS FORM OF RESISTANCE
3259-158083-0109 THEY WERE TOLD THAT NO EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO REACH THEM AND THAT THEIR ATTORNEY HAD BEEN CALLED OFF THE CASE EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HUNGER STRIKING EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT ALL THE OTHERS HAD PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES AND WERE WORKING
3259-158083-0110 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SUSPECTED THE LIES AND REMAINED STRONG IN THEIR RESISTANCE AFTER MISTER O'BRIEN'S ONE VISIT AND THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS IN THE PRESS HE WAS THEREAFTER REFUSED ADMISSION TO THE WORKHOUSE
3259-158083-0111 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP THIS GROUP AWAY FROM ALICE PAUL AND HER COMPANIONS AS THEY COUNTED ON HANDLING THE REBELLION MORE EASILY IN TWO GROUPS THAN ONE MEANWHILE THE CONDITION OF THE PRISONERS IN THE WORKHOUSE GREW STEADILY WORSE
3259-158083-0112 WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE ONLY COURSE OPEN TO OBTAIN A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS A HURRIED JOURNEY BY COUNSEL TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE WADDILL OF NORFOLK VIRGINIA BROUGHT THE WRIT
3259-158083-0113 IT COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING THE PRISONERS INTO COURT AND SHOW CAUSE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL THIS CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN JUDGE SAID OF THE PETITION FOR THE WRIT
3259-158083-0114 THERE FOLLOWED A WEEK MORE MELODRAMATIC THAN THE MOST STIRRING MOVING PICTURE FILM ALTHOUGH THE WRIT HAD BEEN APPLIED FOR IN THE GREATEST SECRECY
3259-158083-0115 A DETECTIVE SUDDENLY APPEARED TO ACCOMPANY MISTER O'BRIEN FROM WASHINGTON TO NORFOLK DURING HIS STAY IN NORFOLK AND BACK TO WASHINGTON TELEPHONE WIRES AT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE TAPPED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS COGNIZANT OF EVERY MOVE IN THIS PROCEDURE BEFORE IT WAS EXECUTED
3259-158083-0116 NO SOONER WAS OUR PLAN DECIDED UPON THAN FRIENDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BESOUGHT US TO ABANDON THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS ONE MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION SENT AN EMISSARY TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WITH THE FOLLOWING APPEAL
3259-158083-0117 IF YOU WILL ONLY DROP THESE PROCEEDINGS I CAN ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE PRISONERS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE WORKHOUSE TO THE JAIL IN A WEEK IN A WEEK THEY MAY BE DEAD BY THAT TIME WE ANSWERED WE CANNOT WAIT
3259-158083-0118 AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HOPED TO INCREASE THEIR FACILITIES FOR FORCIBLE FEEDING AT THE WORKHOUSE THEY ALSO WISHED TO CONCEAL THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN THE EXPOSURE OF WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS AND LASTLY
3259-158083-0119 THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID OPENING UP THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE WORKHOUSE IN VIRGINIA PERSONS CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN VIOLATION OF DISTRICT LAW WERE TRANSPORTED TO VIRGINIA ALIEN TERRITORY TO SERVE THEIR TERMS
3259-158083-0120 IT WAS A MOOT POINT WHETHER PRISONERS WERE SO TREATED WITH SUFFICIENT WARRANT IN LAW EMINENT JURISTS HELD THAT THE DISTRICT HAD NO RIGHT TO CONVICT A PERSON UNDER ITS LAWS AND COMMIT THAT PERSON TO CONFINEMENT IN ANOTHER STATE THEY CONTENDED THAT SENTENCE IMPOSED UPON A PERSON FOR UNLAWFUL ACTS IN THE DISTRICT
3259-158083-0121 SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN THE DISTRICT HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND WHO HAD SERVED THEIR SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA HAD BEEN WITHOUT MONEY OR INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO CONTEST THIS DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS THE ADMINISTRATION
3259-158083-0122 WAS ALARMED WE QUICKENED OUR PACE A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUSHED HIS ATTORNEY AS COURIER TO THE WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TO IMPLORE THEM NOT TO CONSENT TO THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS EASILY ADMITTED AND TRIED TO EXTORT FROM ONE PRISONER AT A TIME A PROMISE TO REJECT THE PLAN
3259-158083-0123 THE WOMEN SUSPECTED HIS SOLICITUDE AND REFUSED TO MAKE ANY PROMISE WHATSOEVER WITHOUT FIRST BEING ALLOWED TO SEE THEIR OWN ATTORNEY WE BEGAN AT ONCE TO SERVE THE WRIT ORDINARILY THIS WOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO BUT FOR US IT DEVELOPED INTO A VERY DIFFICULT TASK
3259-158083-0124 A DEPUTY MARSHAL MUST SERVE THE WRIT COUNSEL SOUGHT A DEPUTY FOR MILES AROUND WASHINGTON NOT ONE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS HOME OR LODGINGS NONE COULD BE REACHED BY TELEPHONE
3259-158083-0125 WHERE HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCREETLY HIDDEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHEN A DEPUTY WAS FOUND SIX ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SERVE THE WRIT ALL FAILED FINALLY BY A RUSE MISTER WHITTAKER WAS CAUGHT AT HIS HOME LATE AT NIGHT
2002-139469-0000 SOME DISORDER HAD SURELY CREPT INTO THE COURSE OF THE ELEMENTS DESTROYING THEIR BENIGNANT INFLUENCE THE WIND PRINCE OF AIR RAGED THROUGH HIS KINGDOM LASHING THE SEA INTO FURY
2002-139469-0001 AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
2002-139469-0002 ON THEIR GREAT HOSTS AND BREAKS THEIR TOTTERING WALLS ARRESTS THEIR NAVIES ON THE OCEAN'S PLAIN AND WHELMS THEIR STRENGTH WITH MOUNTAINS OF THE MAIN
2002-139469-0003 THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
2002-139469-0004 THAT FABLE IS UNJUST WHICH GIVES THE SUPERIORITY TO THE SUN OVER THE WIND WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE LIGHTSOME EARTH THE BALMY ATMOSPHERE AND BASKING NATURE BECOME DARK COLD
2002-139469-0005 AND UNGENIAL WHEN THE SLEEPING WIND HAS AWOKE IN THE EAST OR WHEN THE DUN CLOUDS THICKLY VEIL THE SKY
2002-139469-0006 UNTIL THE DANK EARTH REFUSING TO IMBIBE THE SUPERABUNDANT MOISTURE IT LIES IN POOLS ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE TORCH OF DAY SEEMS LIKE A METEOR TO BE QUENCHED
2002-139469-0007 WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE CLOUD STIRRING NORTH ARISE THE STREAKED BLUE APPEAR AND SOON AN OPENING MADE IN THE VAPOURS IN THE EYE OF THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT AZURE SHINES
2002-139469-0008 THE CLOUDS BECOME THIN AN ARCH IS FORMED FOR EVER RISING UPWARDS TILL THE UNIVERSAL COPE BEING UNVEILED THE SUN POURS FORTH ITS RAYS RE ANIMATED AND FED BY THE BREEZE
2002-139469-0009 THEN MIGHTY ART THOU O WIND TO BE THRONED ABOVE ALL
2002-139469-0010 WHETHER THOU COMEST DESTROYING FROM THE EAST OR PREGNANT WITH ELEMENTARY LIFE FROM THE WEST THEE THE CLOUDS OBEY THE SUN IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEE THE SHORELESS
2002-139469-0011 OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
2002-139469-0012 THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
2002-139469-0013 THEY FLOURISH NURSED BY THEE WHY DOST THOU HOWL THUS O WIND BY DAY AND BY NIGHT FOR FOUR LONG MONTHS THY ROARINGS HAVE NOT CEASED THE SHORES OF THE SEA ARE STREWN WITH WRECKS
2002-139469-0014 THE EARTH HAS SHED HER BEAUTY IN OBEDIENCE TO THY COMMAND THE FRAIL BALLOON DARES NO LONGER SAIL ON THE AGITATED AIR THY MINISTERS THE CLOUDS DELUGE THE LAND WITH RAIN
2002-139469-0015 RIVERS FORSAKE THEIR BANKS THE WILD TORRENT TEARS UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH PLAIN AND WOOD AND VERDANT DELL ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR LOVELINESS
2002-139469-0016 OUR VERY CITIES ARE WASTED BY THEE ALAS WHAT WILL BECOME OF US IT SEEMS AS IF THE GIANT WAVES OF OCEAN AND VAST ARMS OF THE SEA WERE ABOUT TO WRENCH THE DEEP ROOTED ISLAND FROM ITS CENTRE AND CAST IT
2002-139469-0017 A RUIN AND A WRECK UPON THE FIELDS OF THE ATLANTIC WHAT ARE WE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS GLOBE LEAST AMONG THE MANY THAT PEOPLE INFINITE SPACE OUR MINDS EMBRACE INFINITY
2002-139469-0018 OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
2002-139469-0019 HAD THE SAME POWERS AS I I
2002-139469-0020 IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS WE CALL OURSELVES LORDS OF THE CREATION WIELDERS OF THE ELEMENTS MASTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH AND WE ALLEGE IN EXCUSE OF THIS ARROGANCE THAT THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DESTROYED
2002-139469-0021 MAN CONTINUES FOR EVER THUS LOSING OUR IDENTITY THAT OF WHICH WE ARE CHIEFLY CONSCIOUS WE GLORY IN THE CONTINUITY OF OUR SPECIES AND LEARN TO REGARD DEATH WITHOUT TERROR
2002-139469-0022 BUT WHEN ANY WHOLE NATION BECOMES THE VICTIM OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWERS OF EXTERIOR AGENTS THEN INDEED MAN SHRINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE HE FEELS HIS TENURE OF LIFE INSECURE
2002-139469-0023 HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
2002-139469-0024 THE MOUNTING FLAMES HAD CURLED ROUND THE BUILDING AS IT FELL AND WAS DESTROYED THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO THE SUBSTANCES ABOUT THEM
2002-139469-0025 AND THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR PROGRESS YIELDED AT THEIR TOUCH COULD WE TAKE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS POWER AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO ITS OPERATION COULD WE DOMESTICATE A CUB OF THIS WILD BEAST
2002-139469-0026 AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
2002-139469-0027 AND ABOVE ALL WITH REGARD TO THE PLAGUE WE FEARED THE COMING SUMMER NATIONS BORDERING ON THE ALREADY INFECTED COUNTRIES BEGAN TO ENTER UPON SERIOUS PLANS FOR THE BETTER KEEPING OUT OF THE ENEMY
2002-139469-0028 WE A COMMERCIAL PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO BRING SUCH SCHEMES UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE QUESTION OF CONTAGION BECAME MATTER OF EARNEST DISQUISITION
2002-139469-0029 THAT THE PLAGUE WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED CONTAGIOUS LIKE THE SCARLET FEVER OR EXTINCT SMALL POX WAS PROVED IT WAS CALLED AN EPIDEMIC BUT THE GRAND QUESTION
2002-139469-0030 WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
2002-139469-0031 HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY SHIPS TO ONE SEA PORT TOWN YET THE VERY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT THERE WERE INCAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING IT IN A TOWN MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED BUT HOW ARE WE TO JUDGE OF AIRS
2002-139469-0032 AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
2002-139469-0033 IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
2002-139469-0034 THESE REFLECTIONS MADE OUR LEGISLATORS PAUSE BEFORE THEY COULD DECIDE ON THE LAWS TO BE PUT IN FORCE THE EVIL WAS SO WIDE SPREADING SO VIOLENT AND IMMEDICABLE THAT NO CARE NO PREVENTION COULD BE JUDGED SUPERFLUOUS
2002-139469-0035 WHICH EVEN ADDED A CHANCE TO OUR ESCAPE THESE WERE QUESTIONS OF PRUDENCE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN EARNEST CAUTION ENGLAND WAS STILL SECURE FRANCE
2002-139469-0036 GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
2002-139469-0037 BROBDIGNAGIANS BUT WE ON OUR STABLE ABODE COULD NOT BE HURT IN LIFE OR LIMB BY THESE ERUPTIONS OF NATURE WE COULD NOT FEAR WE DID NOT YET A FEELING OF AWE
2002-139469-0038 A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
2002-139469-0039 DEGRADATION OF HUMANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO EVERY HEART NATURE OUR MOTHER AND OUR FRIEND HAD TURNED ON US A BROW OF MENACE SHE SHEWED US PLAINLY THAT THOUGH SHE PERMITTED US TO ASSIGN HER LAWS AND SUBDUE HER APPARENT POWERS
2002-139469-0040 WE MUST QUAKE SHE COULD TAKE OUR GLOBE
2002-139469-0041 AND ALL THAT MAN'S MIND COULD INVENT OR HIS FORCE ACHIEVE SHE COULD TAKE THE BALL IN HER HAND AND CAST IT INTO SPACE WHERE LIFE WOULD BE DRUNK UP AND MAN AND ALL HIS EFFORTS FOR EVER ANNIHILATED
2002-139469-0042 THESE SPECULATIONS WERE RIFE AMONG US YET NOT THE LESS WE PROCEEDED IN OUR DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND OUR PLANS WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT DEMANDED THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS NO VOICE WAS HEARD TELLING US TO HOLD
2002-139469-0043 WHEN FOREIGN DISTRESSES CAME TO BE FELT BY US THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WE SET OURSELVES TO APPLY REMEDIES SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE EMIGRANTS AND MERCHANTS BANKRUPT BY THE FAILURE OF TRADE
2002-139469-0044 THE ENGLISH SPIRIT AWOKE TO ITS FULL ACTIVITY AND AS IT HAD EVER DONE SET ITSELF TO RESIST THE EVIL AND TO STAND IN THE BREACH WHICH DISEASED NATURE HAD SUFFERED CHAOS AND DEATH TO MAKE
2002-139469-0045 IN THE BOUNDS AND BANKS WHICH HAD HITHERTO KEPT THEM OUT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF SUMMER WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WAS GREATER THAN WE HAD AT FIRST SUSPECTED
2002-139469-0046 QUITO WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE MEXICO LAID WASTE BY THE UNITED EFFECTS OF STORM PESTILENCE AND FAMINE CROWDS OF EMIGRANTS INUNDATED THE WEST OF EUROPE
2002-139469-0047 AND OUR ISLAND HAD BECOME THE REFUGE OF THOUSANDS IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0048 HE HAD SOUGHT THIS OFFICE WITH EAGERNESS UNDER THE IDEA OF TURNING HIS WHOLE FORCES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
2002-139469-0049 AT LENGTH FORBADE A RECOURSE TO THE USUAL MODES OF RELIEF TRADE WAS STOPPED BY THE FAILURE OF THE INTERCHANGE OF CARGOES USUAL BETWEEN US AND AMERICA INDIA EGYPT AND GREECE
2002-139469-0050 IN VAIN OUR PROTECTOR AND HIS PARTIZANS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH IN VAIN DAY AFTER DAY HE APPOINTED A PERIOD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEW LAWS CONCERNING HEREDITARY RANK AND PRIVILEGE
2002-139469-0051 IN VAIN HE ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT THE EVIL AS PARTIAL AND TEMPORARY THESE DISASTERS CAME HOME TO SO MANY BOSOMS AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WERE CARRIED SO
2002-139469-0052 ENTIRELY INTO EVERY CLASS AND DIVISION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT OF NECESSITY THEY BECAME THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE STATE THE CHIEF SUBJECTS TO WHICH WE MUST TURN OUR ATTENTION
2002-139469-0053 CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
2002-139469-0054 HINDOSTAN THE CROWDED ABODES OF THE CHINESE ARE MENACED WITH UTTER RUIN WHERE LATE THE BUSY MULTITUDES ASSEMBLED FOR PLEASURE OR PROFIT
2002-139469-0055 NOW ONLY THE SOUND OF WAILING AND MISERY IS HEARD THE AIR IS EMPOISONED AND EACH HUMAN BEING INHALES DEATH EVEN WHILE IN YOUTH AND HEALTH THEIR HOPES ARE IN THE FLOWER
2002-139469-0056 WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
2002-139469-0057 O YES IT WOULD COUNTRYMEN FEAR NOT IN THE STILL UNCULTIVATED WILDS OF AMERICA WHAT WONDER THAT AMONG ITS OTHER GIANT DESTROYERS PLAGUE SHOULD BE NUMBERED
2002-139469-0058 IT WOULD EXPIRE IN THESE CLIMES IT DRINKS THE DARK BLOOD OF THE INHABITANT OF THE SOUTH BUT IT NEVER FEASTS ON THE PALE FACED CELT IF
2002-139469-0059 PERCHANCE SOME STRICKEN ASIATIC
2002-139469-0060 PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
2002-139469-0061 LET US LAMENT OVER AND ASSIST THE CHILDREN OF THE GARDEN OF THE EARTH LATE WE ENVIED THEIR ABODES THEIR SPICY GROVES FERTILE PLAINS AND ABUNDANT LOVELINESS BUT IN THIS MORTAL LIFE EXTREMES ARE ALWAYS MATCHED
2002-139469-0062 THE THORN GROWS WITH THE ROSE THE POISON TREE AND THE CINNAMON MINGLE THEIR BOUGHS
2002-139469-0063 MARBLE HALLS AND INFINITE WEALTH IS NOW A TOMB THE TENT OF THE ARAB IS FALLEN IN THE SANDS AND HIS HORSE SPURNS THE GROUND UNBRIDLED AND UNSADDLED THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION FILLS THE VALLEY OF CASHMERE
2002-139469-0064 ITS DELLS AND WOODS ITS COOL FOUNTAINS AND GARDENS OF ROSES ARE POLLUTED BY THE DEAD IN CIRCASSIA AND GEORGIA THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY WEEPS OVER THE RUIN OF ITS FAVOURITE TEMPLE THE FORM OF WOMAN
2002-139469-0065 OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
2002-139469-0066 WHOSE TRADE DEPENDED ON EXPORTS AND INTERCHANGE OF WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT SUCH THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN SINGLY AFFECT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE NATION WAS NOW SHAKEN BY FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE LOSSES
2002-139469-0067 FAMILIES BRED IN OPULENCE AND LUXURY WERE REDUCED TO BEGGARY THE VERY STATE OF PEACE IN WHICH WE GLORIED WAS INJURIOUS THERE WERE NO MEANS OF EMPLOYING THE IDLE
2002-139469-0068 EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
2002-139469-0069 AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PLAGUE RAGED
2002-139469-0070 AND BRING BACK THE EARTH TO ITS ACCUSTOMED HEALTH
2002-139469-0071 AT THE MULTITUDE OF EVILS THAT GATHERED ROUND US MUST HE TAX THE LANDED INTEREST TO ASSIST OUR COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO DO THIS HE MUST GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE CHIEF LAND HOLDERS THE NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0072 AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
2002-139469-0073 HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
2002-139469-0074 THROWING HIS ARMS ASIDE HE MUST FOR PRESENT ENDS GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF HIS ENDEAVOURS HE CAME TO WINDSOR TO CONSULT WITH US EVERY DAY ADDED TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
2002-139469-0075 THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
2002-139469-0076 THE BLOW WAS STRUCK THE ARISTOCRACY OBTAINED ALL THEY WISHED AND THEY SUBSCRIBED TO A TWELVEMONTHS BILL WHICH LEVIED TWENTY PER CENT ON ALL THE RENT ROLLS OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0077 CALM WAS NOW RESTORED TO THE METROPOLIS AND TO THE POPULOUS CITIES BEFORE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION AND WE RETURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DISTANT CALAMITIES WONDERING IF THE FUTURE WOULD BRING ANY ALLEVIATION
2002-139469-0078 TO THEIR EXCESS IT WAS AUGUST SO THERE COULD BE SMALL HOPE OF RELIEF DURING THE HEATS ON THE CONTRARY
2002-139469-0079 WHILE STARVATION DID ITS ACCUSTOMED WORK THOUSANDS DIED UNLAMENTED FOR BESIDE THE YET WARM CORPSE THE MOURNER WAS STRETCHED MADE MUTE BY DEATH
2002-139469-0080 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
2002-139469-0081 WHEN ANY ONE MET A FRIEND IN THE STREET HE ONLY CRIED AS HE HURRIED ON YOU KNOW WHILE THE OTHER WITH AN EJACULATION OF FEAR AND HORROR WOULD ANSWER
2002-139469-0082 WHAT WILL BECOME OF US AT LENGTH IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE PARAGRAPH WAS INSERTED IN AN OBSCURE PART WE REGRET TO STATE
2002-139469-0083 THAT THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF THE PLAGUE HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED AT LEGHORN GENOA AND MARSEILLES NO WORD OF COMMENT FOLLOWED
2002-139469-0084 WE WERE AS A MAN WHO HEARS THAT HIS HOUSE IS BURNING AND YET HURRIES THROUGH THE STREETS BORNE ALONG BY A LURKING HOPE OF A MISTAKE
2002-139469-0085 AND SEES HIS SHELTERING ROOF ENVELOPED IN A FLAME BEFORE IT HAD BEEN A RUMOUR BUT NOW IN WORDS UNERASEABLE IN DEFINITE AND UNDENIABLE PRINT THE KNOWLEDGE WENT FORTH
2002-139469-0086 ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
2002-139469-0087 WITH A PEN OF IRON IMPRESSED BY FIRE WOVEN IN THE CLOUDS STAMPED ON THE VERY FRONT OF THE UNIVERSE THE ENGLISH
2002-139469-0088 WHETHER TRAVELLERS OR RESIDENTS CAME POURING IN ONE GREAT REVULSIVE STREAM BACK ON THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WITH THEM CROWDS OF ITALIANS AND SPANIARDS
2002-139469-0089 OUR LITTLE ISLAND WAS FILLED EVEN TO BURSTING AT FIRST AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF SPECIE MADE ITS APPEARANCE WITH THE EMIGRANTS BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO MEANS OF RECEIVING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT THEY SPENT AMONG US
2002-139469-0090 RENTS WERE UNPAID AND THEIR REMITTANCES FAILED THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THESE CROWDS OF WRETCHED PERISHING CREATURES LATE NURSLINGS OF LUXURY
2002-139469-0091 AND NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO SAVE THEM AS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ENGLISH UNLOCKED THEIR HOSPITABLE STORE FOR THE RELIEF OF THOSE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY POLITICAL REVOLUTION
2002-139469-0092 SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
2002-139469-0093 OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE
2002-139469-0094 WAS NOW ATTENDED TO MORE PARSIMONIOUSLY THAT IT MIGHT EMBRACE A WIDER PORTION OF UTILITY IT WAS NOT HOWEVER MONEY EXCEPT PARTIALLY BUT THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
2002-139469-0095 THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH
2002-139469-0096 OUR PLEASURE GROUNDS AND PARKS LIVE STOCK DIMINISHED SENSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE GREAT DEMAND IN THE MARKET EVEN THE POOR DEER OUR ANTLERED PROTEGES
2002-139469-0097 WERE OBLIGED TO FALL FOR THE SAKE OF WORTHIER PENSIONERS THE LABOUR NECESSARY TO BRING THE LANDS TO THIS SORT OF CULTURE EMPLOYED AND FED THE OFFCASTS OF THE DIMINISHED MANUFACTORIES
2002-139469-0098 ADRIAN DID NOT REST ONLY WITH THE EXERTIONS HE COULD MAKE WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN POSSESSIONS HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WEALTHY OF THE LAND HE MADE PROPOSALS IN PARLIAMENT LITTLE ADAPTED TO PLEASE THE RICH
2002-139469-0099 EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0100 YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
2002-139469-0101 MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
2002-139469-0102 THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED
2002-139469-0103 IF THEY HAD NOW ENJOYED WHAT THEY BEFORE CALLED A NECESSARY THE EASE OF A CARRIAGE CHAIRS AS IN OLDEN TIME AND INDIAN PALANQUINS WERE INTRODUCED FOR THE INFIRM
2002-139469-0104 BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
2002-139469-0105 ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS
2002-139469-0106 TO NECESSITOUS FAMILIES MANY OF THESE OF HIGH RANK IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES NOW WITH HOE IN HAND TURNED UP THE SOIL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY AT LAST
2002-139469-0107 TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
2002-139469-0108 SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0109 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED OUR FINE BREEDS OF HORSES OR HAVE UTTERLY CHANGED THE FACE OF THE ORNAMENTED PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0110 THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
2002-139469-0111 AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
2002-139469-0112 CONCOMITANTS WINTER WAS HAILED A GENERAL AND NEVER FAILING PHYSICIAN
2002-139469-0113 WERE WELCOMED WITH GRATITUDE THE EFFECTS OF PURIFYING COLD WERE IMMEDIATELY FELT AND THE LISTS OF MORTALITY ABROAD WERE
2002-139469-0114 MANY OF OUR VISITORS LEFT US THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE FAR IN THE SOUTH FLED DELIGHTEDLY FROM OUR NORTHERN WINTER AND SOUGHT THEIR NATIVE LAND SECURE OF PLENTY EVEN AFTER THEIR FEARFUL
2002-139469-0115 VISITATION WE BREATHED AGAIN
5390-30102-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN LOUISE SCENTS A MYSTERY LOUISE MERRICK WAS THE ELDEST OF UNCLE JOHN'S NIECES HAVING JUST PASSED HER EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY
5390-30102-0001 LED A MERE BUTTERFLY EXISTENCE HER TWO COUSINS FRANKLY AGREED THAT LOUISE WAS SHALLOW INSINCERE AND INCLINED TO BE AFFECTED BUT OF THE THREE GIRLS
5390-30102-0002 AND MEN USUALLY ADMIRED HER GRACEFUL FIGURE AND HER PIQUANT PRETTY FACE WITH ITS CROWN OF FLUFFY BLONDE HAIR AND WINNING EXPRESSION THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ARTHUR WELDON
5390-30102-0003 A YOUNG MAN OF POSITION IN THE CITY BUT UNCLE JOHN IGNORED THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING ONE OF HIS CHERISHED NIECES AND DECLARED THAT LOUISE WAS STILL TOO YOUNG TO THINK OF MARRIAGE WHEN AWAY FROM HER FRIVOLOUS MOTHER
5390-30102-0004 AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
5390-30102-0005 LOUISE MERRICK WAS A CLEVER GIRL POSSESSING A QUICK INTELLECT AND A KEEN INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF OTHERS HER APPARENT SHALLOWNESS WAS A BLIND OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS HER ASSUMED GRACIOUSNESS
5390-30102-0006 AND WHILE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LOVABLE WITHOUT ANY PRETENCE OR SHAM SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LOUISE MERRICK AND ALLOW OTHERS TO READ HER AS SHE ACTUALLY WAS PATSY AND BETH THOUGHT THEY KNEW HER
5390-30102-0007 AND ADMIRED OR LIKED RATHER THAN LOVED THEIR COUSIN UNCLE JOHN THOUGHT HE KNEW HER TOO AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS ELDEST NIECE IN SPITE OF SOME DISCOVERED QUALITIES THAT WERE NOT WHOLLY ADMIRABLE
5390-30102-0008 AN EXTENSIVE COURSE OF LIGHT LITERATURE NOT VOID OF DETECTIVE STORIES HAD AT THIS MOMENT PRIMED LOUISE WITH ITS INFLUENCE TO THE EXTENT OF INDUCING HER TO SCENT A MYSTERY IN THE HISTORY OF CAPTAIN WEGG
5390-30102-0009 THE PLAIN FOLKS AROUND MILLVILLE MIGHT SPECULATE LISTLESSLY UPON THE QUEER DOIN'S AT THE FARM AND NEVER GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE TRUTH INDEED THE STRANGE OCCURRENCES SHE HAD JUST HEARD
5390-30102-0010 WERE NEARLY FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOON WOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER UNLESS THE QUICK EAR OF A YOUNG GIRL HAD CAUGHT THE CLUE SO LONG IGNORED AT FIRST SHE SCARCELY APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
5390-30102-0011 IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT AN EFFORT TO READ TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA CAPTAIN'S ROMANCE WOULD BE A CHARMING DIVERSION WHILE SHE RESIDED AT MILLVILLE AND IN UNDERTAKING THE TASK SHE LAUGHINGLY ACCUSED HERSELF OF BECOMING AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE
5390-30102-0012 AN OCCUPATION THAT PROMISED TO BE THRILLING AND DELIGHTFUL WARNED HOWEVER BY THE REBUFF SHE HAD MET WITH FROM UNCLE JOHN THE GIRL DECIDED NOT TO CONFIDE EITHER HER SUSPICIONS OR HER PROPOSED INVESTIGATION TO ANYONE FOR THE PRESENT
5390-30102-0013 LOUISE SET TO WORK TO TABULATE THE INFORMATION SHE HAD RECEIVED THUS FAR NOTING THE ELEMENT OF MYSTERY EACH FACT EVOLVED FIRST CAPTAIN WEGG MUST HAVE BEEN A RICH MAN IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS HOUSE
5390-30102-0014 SECONDLY THE CAPTAIN A SURLY AND SILENT MAN HAD BROUGHT HITHER PERHAPS BY FORCE A YOUNG WOMAN AS HIS WIFE WHO WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT SHE PINED AWAY AND DIED WHO WAS THIS WOMAN
5390-30102-0015 WHAT HAD RENDERED HER SO UNHAPPY AND DESPAIRING THIRDLY THE CAPTAIN'S ONLY FRIEND HAD BEEN A CRAZY MAN NAMED WILL THOMPSON WAS HE CRAZY BEFORE THE CAPTAIN'S DEATH OR HAD HE BECOME CRAZED AT THAT TIME
5390-30102-0016 THE BOY FLED AND LEFT HIS SWEETHEART WITHOUT A WORD WHY UNLESS SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THAT RENDERED THEIR MARRIAGE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE FIFTH PLACE THERE WAS OLD HUCKS AND HIS BLIND WIFE TO BE CONSIDERED
5390-30102-0017 WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR OLD MASTER'S SECRET HISTORY WHAT TRAGIC MEMORIES LURKED BENEATH THE MAN'S PERPETUAL SMILE AND THE WOMAN'S COMPOSED AND SIGHTLESS FACE SURELY THERE WAS ENOUGH HERE TO EXCITE THE CURIOSITY
5390-30102-0018 AND WARRANT AN EFFORT TO UNTANGLE THE MYSTERY AND AS INSTRUMENTS TO THE END THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE AVAILABLE WHO COULD BE OF USE TO HER MC NUTT THE AGENT WHO EVIDENTLY KNEW MORE THAN HE HAD CARED TO TELL OLD HUCKS AND HIS WIFE
5390-30102-0019 AND ETHEL THOMPSON THE SCHOOL TEACHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT ONE OR ANOTHER OF THESE FOUR MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WOULD BE HER PLEASANT DUTY TO OBTAIN A FULL DISCLOSURE SO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HER INVESTIGATIONS AT ONCE
5390-30102-0020 WHEN HER UNCLE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO THE PIGS LOUISE SAID TO HIM I'VE BEEN THINKING DEAR THAT WE OUGHT TO CALL UPON THAT YOUNG LADY WHO ARRANGED OUR ROOMS AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS THAT'S TRUE HE REPLIED

5390-30102-0023 BUT HE TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO HARNESS THE HORSE LOUISE STOOD WATCHING HIM YOUR FINGERS ARE QUITE NIMBLE THOMAS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ONCE A SAILOR SHE SAID BUT SAILORS HAVE TO BE NIMBLE MISS HE RETURNED
5390-30102-0024 BUCKLING A STRAP UNMOVED WHO TOL YE I WERE ONCE A SEA FARIN MAN I GUESSED IT AS HE APPEARED INDISPOSED TO SAY MORE ON THE SUBJECT SHE ASKED DID YOU SAIL WITH CAPTAIN WEGG PARTLY MISS DAN'S ALREADY NOW

5390-30102-0028 OR WHY SOMEONE DON'T KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD DAN TURNED HIS LONG LEAN FACE AS IF TO GIVE THE SPEAKER A REPROACHFUL LOOK THEN HE GROANED AGAIN LEANED FORWARD AND DREW THE BUGGY SLOWLY INTO THE STONY LANE
5390-30102-0029 DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE THOMPSONS LIVE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN NO WHOA DAN THAT WAS THE BEST THING THE NAG DID HE KNEW HOW TO WHOA THOMAS CALLED UNCLE JOHN TURNING IN HIS SEAT

5390-30096-0000 CHAPTER ONE UNCLE JOHN'S FARM HOW DID I HAPPEN TO OWN A FARM ASKED UNCLE JOHN INTERRUPTING HIS SOUP LONG ENOUGH TO FIX AN INQUIRING GLANCE UPON MAJOR DOYLE WHO SAT OPPOSITE
5390-30096-0001 REPLIED THE MAJOR COMPOSEDLY IT'S A PART OF MY DUTY IN ATTENDING TO THOSE AFFAIRS YOU WON'T LOOK AFTHER YOURSELF TO LEND CERTAIN SUMS OF YOUR MONEY TO NEEDY AND AMBITIOUS YOUNG MEN WHO WANT A START IN LIFE OH UNCLE
5390-30096-0002 DO YOU DO THAT EXCLAIMED MISS PATRICIA DOYLE WHO SAT BETWEEN HER UNCLE AND FATHER AND KEPT AN ACTIVE EYE UPON BOTH SO THE MAJOR SAYS ANSWERED UNCLE JOHN DRYLY AND IT'S TRUE
5390-30096-0003 ASSERTED THE OTHER HE'S ASSISTED THREE OR FOUR SCORE YOUNG MEN TO START IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BY LENDING THEM SUMS RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
5390-30096-0004 AND IT'S THE MOST WASTEFUL AND EXTRAVAGANT CHARITY I EVER HEARD OF BUT I'M SO GLAD CRIED PATSY CLAPPING HER HANDS WITH A DELIGHTED GESTURE IT'S A SPLENDID WAY TO DO GOOD
5390-30096-0005 WITHOUT CAPITAL YOU KNOW MANY A YOUNG FELLOW WOULD NEVER GET HIS FOOT ON THE FIRST ROUND OF THE LADDER AND MANY WILL NEVER GET IT THERE IN ANY EVENT DECLARED THE MAJOR WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
5390-30096-0006 AND HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DESARVING OR NOT RETORTED MAJOR DOYLE FIERCELY DO YE WANT ME TO BECOME A SLEUTH OR ENGAGE DETECTIVES TO TRACK THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ERRONEOUS PHILANTHROPY
5390-30096-0007 I JUST HAVE TO FORM A JUDGMENT AN TAKE ME CHANCES AND WHIN A POOR DEVIL GOES WRONG
5390-30096-0008 BUT SOME OF THEM MUST SUCCEED VENTURED PATSY IN A CONCILIATORY TONE SOME DO SAID JOHN MERRICK AND THAT REPAYS ME FOR ALL MY TROUBLE
5390-30096-0009 QUERIED THE MAJOR YOU MANE ALL MY THROUBLE WELL AND YOUR MONEY
5390-30096-0010 WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER WHAT OF IT RETORTED THE LITTLE ROUND FACED MILLIONAIRE LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARING FIXEDLY AT THE OTHER THAT'S WHAT I EMPLOY YOU FOR NOW NOW GENTLEMEN CRIED PATSY EARNESTLY
5390-30096-0011 OF HIS FALLING DOWN AND WORSHIPING HIM JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE TO BE SURE BUT THERE WERE PALLIATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALMOST EXCUSED HIM HE HAD BEEN SO BUSILY OCCUPIED IN INDUSTRY
5390-30096-0012 THAT HE NEVER NOTICED HOW HIS WEALTH WAS PILING UP UNTIL HE DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT THEN HE PROMPTLY RETIRED TO GIVE THE OTHER FELLOWS A CHANCE AND HE NOW DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SIMPLE ACTS OF CHARITY
5390-30096-0013 AND THE WELFARE AND ENTERTAINMENT OF HIS THREE NIECES HE HAD RESCUED MAJOR DOYLE AND HIS DAUGHTER FROM A LOWLY CONDITION AND PLACED THE FORMER IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE OF ISHAM MARVIN AND COMPANY
5390-30096-0014 SIMPLE IN HIS TASTES MODEST AND RETIRING LACKING THE EDUCATION AND REFINEMENTS OF POLITE SOCIETY BUT SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD THE LITTLE MAN FOUND HIS GREATEST ENJOYMENT IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE
5390-30096-0015 THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN FOUNDING BEING NO LONGER ABSORBED IN BUSINESS HE HAD COME TO DETEST ITS EVERY DETAIL AND SO ALLOWED HIS BANKERS TO CARE FOR HIS FORTUNE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW TO DISBURSE HIS INCOME
5390-30096-0016 WHILE HE HIMSELF STROVE TO ENJOY LIFE IN A SHY AND BOYISH FASHION THAT WAS AS UNUSUAL IN A MAN OF HIS WEALTH AS IT WAS ADMIRABLE HE HAD NEVER MARRIED
5390-30096-0017 PATRICIA WAS THE APPLE OF UNCLE JOHN'S EYE AND THE ONE GODDESS ENSHRINED IN HER DOTING FATHER'S HEART GLANCING AT HER
5390-30096-0018 IN HER PLAIN MUSLIN GOWN A STRANGER WOULD BE TEMPTED TO WONDER WHY SHE WAS RED HAIRED FRECKLED AS A ROBIN'S EGG PUG NOSED AND WIDE MOUTHED BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE BEAUTIFUL
5390-30096-0019 AND THEY SPARKLED WITH A COMBINATION OF SAUCY MISCHIEF AND KINDLY CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS THAT LENT HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE CHARM EVERYONE LOVED PATSY DOYLE
5390-30096-0020 AND PEOPLE WOULD GAZE LONGER AT HER SMILING LIPS AND DANCING EYES THAN UPON MANY A MORE HANDSOME BUT LESS ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE WAS NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD NOT VERY TALL AND HER FORM TO SPEAK CHARITABLY
5390-30096-0021 HE WANTED CAPITAL TO PATENT THE PUMP AND PUT IT ON THE MARKET THE THING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD JOHN SO I LENT HIM A THOUSAND OF YOUR MONEY QUITE RIGHT RETURNED UNCLE JOHN NODDING BUT PRETTY SOON HE CAME BACK WITH A SAD TALE
5390-30096-0022 HE WAS IN A BAD FIX ANOTHER FELLOW WAS CONTESTING HIS PATENT AND FIGHTING HARD TO HEAD HIM OFF IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY TO FIGHT BACK THREE THOUSAND AT LEAST
5390-30096-0023 BUT HE WAS DECENT ABOUT IT AFTER ALL HIS FATHER HAD LEFT HIM A LITTLE FARM AT MILLVILLE HE COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS WORTH BUT THERE WERE SIXTY ACRES AND SOME GOOD BUILDINGS AND HE WOULD DEED IT TO YOU AS SECURITY
5390-30096-0024 IF YOU WOULD LET HIM HAVE THREE THOUSAND MORE SO YOU TOOK THE FARM AND GAVE HIM THE MONEY I DID SIR PERHAPS I AM TO BLAME
5390-30096-0025 MAKING FIVE THOUSAND IN ALL WELL IT'S GONE JOHN AND YOU'VE GOT THE FARM THE OTHER FELLOWS WERE TOO CLEVER FOR MY YOUNG FRIEND JOSEPH WEGG AND KNOCKED OUT HIS PATENT I'M SO SORRY SAID PATSY SYMPATHETICALLY

5390-30096-0027 HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED THE FARM AT ALL I LOOKED UP A REAL ESTATE DEALER LIVING AT MILLVILLE AND WROTE HIM ABOUT THE WEGG FARM HE SAID IF ANY ONE WANTED THE PLACE VERY BADLY IT MIGHT SELL FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HUMPH
5390-30096-0028 BUT HIS BEST INFORMATION WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT NO ONE WANTED IT AT ALL PATSY LAUGHED POOR UNCLE JOHN SHE SAID THE LITTLE MAN HOWEVER WAS SERIOUS
5390-30096-0029 FOR A TIME HE ATE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND REVOLVED AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IN HIS MIND YEARS AGO
5390-30096-0030 BETH IS STILL WITH LOUISE YOU KNOW AND THEY MUST FIND THE CITY DEADLY DULL JUST NOW THE FARM'S THE THING AND THE MAJOR CAN RUN UP TO SEE US FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE HOT WEATHER AND WE'LL ALL HAVE A GLORIOUS LAZY TIME

5390-30096-0033 IT'S GONE TO RUIN AND DECAY THE LAST FEW YEARS
887-123291-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
887-123291-0001 IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
887-123291-0002 NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
887-123291-0003 WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
887-123291-0004 SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE
887-123291-0005 THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
887-123291-0006 AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
887-123291-0007 WE KNEW ALL THESE DETAILS BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE THAT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE QUESTION HAD ADVANCED TO FARTHER STAGES OTHER SIMILAR MAXILLARIES THOUGH BELONGING TO INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE LOOSE GREY SOIL
887-123291-0008 OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
887-123291-0009 NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
887-123291-0010 BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
887-123291-0011 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0012 SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
887-123291-0013 TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
887-123291-0014 PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
887-123291-0015 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0016 WAS STRUCK DUMB LIKEWISE WE RAISED THE BODY WE STOOD IT UP AGAINST A ROCK IT SEEMED TO STARE AT US OUT OF ITS EMPTY ORBITS WE SOUNDED WITH OUR KNUCKLES HIS HOLLOW FRAME AFTER SOME MOMENTS SILENCE THE PROFESSOR WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
887-123291-0017 OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
887-123291-0018 HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
887-123291-0019 EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT THE SAINT THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
887-123291-0020 I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX
887-123291-0021 THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
887-123291-0022 I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
887-123291-0023 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
887-123291-0024 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
887-123291-0025 HERE MY UNCLE'S UNFORTUNATE INFIRMITY MET HIM THAT OF BEING UNABLE IN PUBLIC TO PRONOUNCE HARD WORDS
887-123291-0026 HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
887-123291-0027 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0028 HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
887-123291-0029 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
887-123291-0030 I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
887-123291-0031 BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THAT VALUABLE SOLVENT YET SUCH AS IT IS THE BODY SHALL TELL US ITS OWN WONDERFUL STORY HERE THE PROFESSOR LAID HOLD OF THE FOSSIL SKELETON AND HANDLED IT WITH THE SKILL OF A DEXTEROUS SHOWMAN
887-123291-0032 YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
887-123291-0033 IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
887-123291-0034 IT PRESENTS NO APPEARANCE OF THAT PROGNATHISM
887-123291-0035 IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
887-123291-0036 BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
887-123291-0037 HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
887-123291-0038 CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
887-123291-0039 BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
887-123291-0040 THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
887-123291-0041 IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
887-123291-0042 HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
887-123290-0000 WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
887-123290-0001 SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
887-123290-0002 ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
887-123290-0003 JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
887-123290-0004 WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
887-123290-0005 I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
887-123290-0006 TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
887-123290-0007 HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
887-123290-0008 A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
887-123290-0009 THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND THE NORTH WEST WIND BLEW STEADILY WHAT COULD I DO COULD I STAND AGAINST THE TWO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF HANS HAD BUT TAKEN MY SIDE BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE
887-123290-0010 THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
887-123290-0011 I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
887-123290-0012 I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT
887-123290-0013 WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
887-123290-0014 THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
887-123290-0015 I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
887-123290-0016 AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS
887-123290-0017 THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
887-123290-0018 THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
887-123290-0019 IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
887-123290-0020 AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
887-123290-0021 FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
887-123290-0022 WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
887-123290-0023 WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT
887-123290-0024 HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
887-123290-0025 BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
887-123290-0026 A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
887-123290-0027 HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
887-123290-0028 LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
887-123290-0029 FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
887-123290-0030 BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN
887-123290-0031 HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT AXEL AXEL A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
441-128988-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0001 THAT HE HAD COME BACK A COMPARATIVE PAUPER SURPRISED NO ONE FOR THIS WAS A COMMON THING TO HAPPEN TO A PIRATE BUT THE WONDER WAS THAT HE GOT BACK AT ALL HE HAD NO MONEY BUT BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS CRAFTY ABILITIES
441-128988-0002 HE MANAGED TO GET POSSESSION OF A SHIP WHICH HE MANNED WITH A CREW OF ABOUT A SCORE OF IMPECUNIOUS DARE DEVILS WHO WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING TO MEND THEIR FORTUNES HAVING NOW BECOME VERY FOND OF LAND FIGHTING
441-128988-0003 HE DID NOT GO OUT IN SEARCH OF SHIPS BUT DIRECTED HIS VESSEL TO A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED DE LOS CAYOS ON THE COAST OF CUBA FOR HERE HE THOUGHT WAS A CHANCE FOR A GOOD AND EASY STROKE OF BUSINESS
441-128988-0004 SO THAT LARGE SHIPS COULD NOT APPROACH VERY NEAR AND THUS THE VILLAGERS WERE KEPT BUSY CARRYING GOODS AND SUPPLIES IN SMALL BOATS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM THE TOWN TO THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
441-128988-0005 HERE WAS A NICE LITTLE PRIZE THAT COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM AND L'OLONNOIS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS TO SEIZE IT AS HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP DIRECTLY UP TO THE TOWN
441-128988-0006 HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
441-128988-0007 INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
441-128988-0008 IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BELIEVE IT THE GOOD NEWS OF THE DEATH OF L'OLONNOIS HAD COME FROM CAMPEACHY TO HAVANA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LATTER TOWN ALSO REJOICED GREATLY TO BE NOW TOLD THAT THIS SCOURGE OF THE WEST INDIES WAS ALIVE
441-128988-0009 AND WAS ABOUT TO FALL UPON A PEACEFUL LITTLE VILLAGE ON THE ISLAND OVER WHICH HE RULED FILLED THE GOVERNOR WITH RAGE AS WELL AS AMAZEMENT AND HE ORDERED A WELL ARMED SHIP WITH A LARGE CREW OF FIGHTING MEN TO SAIL IMMEDIATELY FOR DE LOS CAYOS
441-128988-0010 BY THE TIME THE WAR VESSEL HAD ARRIVED AT DE LOS CAYOS L'OLONNOIS HAD MADE HIS PREPARATION TO ATTACK THE PLACE HE HAD PROCURED TWO LARGE CANOES AND IN THESE HE HAD INTENDED TO ROW UP TO THE TOWN AND LAND WITH HIS MEN
441-128988-0011 BUT NOW THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER HIS PLANS THE ORDINARY PERSON IN COMMAND OF TWO SMALL BOATS WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT A VILLAGE WHICH HE SUPPOSED ALMOST DEFENCELESS WAS PROTECTED BY A LARGE MAN OF WAR
441-128988-0012 WITH CANNON AND A WELL ARMED CREW WOULD HAVE ALTERED HIS PLANS SO COMPLETELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COAST OF CUBA WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION BUT THE PIRATES OF THAT DAY SEEMED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE ELEMENT OF ODDS
441-128988-0013 IF THEY MET AN ENEMY WHO WAS WEAK THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM AND IF THEY MET WITH ONE WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL STRONGER THAN THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM ALL THE SAME WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FIGHT THEY FOUGHT
441-128988-0014 BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
441-128988-0015 AND HE ALSO NEEDED A LARGER FORCE THAN HE HAD WITH HIM AND HE THEREFORE CAPTURED SOME MEN WHO WERE FISHING ALONG THE COAST AND PUT THEM INTO HIS CANOES TO HELP WORK THE OARS THEN BY NIGHT HE PROCEEDED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPANISH VESSEL
441-128988-0016 THE MAN OF WAR WAS ANCHORED NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TOWN AND WHEN ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WATCH ON DECK SAW SOME CANOES APPROACHING THEY SUPPOSED THEM TO BE BOATS FROM SHORE
441-128988-0017 FOR AS HAS BEEN SAID SUCH VESSELS WERE CONTINUALLY PLYING ABOUT THOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE CANOES WERE HAILED AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIRATE SHIP UPON THE COAST
441-128988-0018 BUT THEIR WAY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM ANY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THEY ROWED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE TOWN AND WAITED UNTIL NEARLY DAYBREAK THEN THEY BOLDLY MADE FOR THE MAN OF WAR
441-128988-0019 ONE CANOE ATTACKING HER ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER BEFORE THE SPANISH COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY PIRATES UPON THEIR DECKS THE DREADED L'OLONNOIS AT THEIR HEAD
441-128988-0020 AND THEY FOUGHT EACH SCOUNDREL OF THEM LIKE THREE MEN AND THE SAVAGE FIGHT ENDED BY EVERY SPANISH SAILOR OR OFFICER WHO WAS NOT KILLED OR WOUNDED BEING FORCED TO STAY BELOW DECKS WHERE THE HATCHES WERE SECURELY FASTENED DOWN UPON THEM
441-128988-0021 L'OLONNOIS NOW STOOD A PROUD VICTOR ON THE DECK OF HIS PRIZE AND BEING A MAN OF PRINCIPLE HE DETERMINED TO LIVE UP TO THE DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
441-128988-0022 BARING HIS MUSCULAR AND HAIRY RIGHT ARM HE CLUTCHED THE HANDLE OF HIS SHARP AND HEAVY CUTLASS AND ORDERED THE PRISONERS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM BELOW ONE AT A TIME AND CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD
441-128988-0023 HE WISHED TO GIVE SPAIN A LESSON WHICH WOULD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE INTERFERED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HE DETERMINED TO ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF PERSONALLY TEACHING THIS LESSON
441-128988-0024 THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT A SOLDIER WAS DESPERATELY FRIGHTENED AND BEGGED PITEOUSLY FOR HIS LIFE L'OLONNOIS FINDING THAT THE MAN WAS WILLING TO TELL EVERYTHING HE KNEW QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE SENDING OF THIS VESSEL FROM HAVANA
441-128988-0025 AND WHEN THE POOR FELLOW HAD FINISHED BY TELLING THAT HE HAD COME THERE NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBEYING HIS MASTER TO HANG ALL THE PIRATES EXCEPT THEIR LEADER THAT GREAT BUCCANEER LAUGHED AND FINDING HE COULD GET NOTHING MORE FROM THE NEGRO
441-128988-0026 CUT OFF HIS HEAD LIKEWISE AND HIS BODY WAS TUMBLED INTO THE SEA AFTER THOSE OF HIS COMPANIONS NOW THERE WAS NOT A SPANIARD LEFT ON BOARD THE GREAT SHIP EXCEPT ONE MAN
441-128988-0027 WHO HAD BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE FATE OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE L'OLONNOIS HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE TO ATTEND TO AND HE NEEDED A MESSENGER TO CARRY A LETTER THE PIRATE CAPTAIN WENT INTO THE CABIN WHERE HE FOUND WRITING MATERIALS READY TO HIS HAND
441-128988-0028 AND THERE HE COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA A PART OF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS I SHALL NEVER HENCEFORWARD GIVE QUARTER UNTO ANY SPANIARD WHATSOEVER
441-128988-0029 WHEN THIS MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED BY THE DIGNIFIED OFFICIAL WHO FILLED THE POST OF GOVERNOR OF CUBA HE STORMED AND FAIRLY FOAMED AT THE MOUTH TO BE UTTERLY FOILED AND DISCOMFITED BY THIS RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0030 AND TO BE AFTERWARDS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF SUCH UNHEARD OF INSOLENCE AND ABUSE WAS MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY OF HIS OFFICIALS AND ATTENDANTS HE SWORE A TERRIBLE OATH THAT AFTER THAT HOUR HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN GIVE QUARTER TO ANY BUCCANEER
441-128988-0031 BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF HAVANA AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HEARD OF THIS TERRIBLE RESOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNOR THEY WERE VERY MUCH DISTURBED THEY LIVED IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ATTACK ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN FISHING OR MARITIME PURSUITS
441-128988-0032 AND THEY FEARED THAT WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT NO BUCCANEER WAS TO RECEIVE QUARTER THE SPANISH COLONISTS WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHERE THEY MIGHT BE FOUND AND TAKEN
441-128988-0033 CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS REPRESENTED TO THE GOVERNOR THAT HIS PLAN OF VENGEANCE WOULD WORK MOST DISASTROUSLY FOR THE SPANISH SETTLERS FOR THE BUCCANEERS COULD DO FAR MORE DAMAGE TO THEM THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO THESE DREADFUL BRETHREN OF THE COAST
441-128988-0034 AND THAT UNLESS HE WISHED TO BRING UPON THEM TROUBLES GREATER THAN THOSE OF FAMINE OR PESTILENCE THEY BEGGED THAT HE WOULD RETRACT HIS OATH WHEN THE HIGH DIGNITARY HAD COOLED DOWN A LITTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE IN WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM
441-128988-0035 AND HE ALSO DISCOVERED MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PROVISIONS ON BOARD FOR WHEN THE VESSEL WAS SENT FROM HAVANA IT WAS SUPPOSED SHE WOULD MAKE BUT A VERY SHORT CRUISE
441-130108-0000 A SPUTTERING OF MUSKETRY WAS ALWAYS TO BE HEARD LATER THE CANNON HAD ENTERED THE DISPUTE IN THE FOG FILLED AIR THEIR VOICES MADE A THUDDING SOUND THE REVERBERATIONS WERE CONTINUAL
441-130108-0001 THIS PART OF THE WORLD LED A STRANGE BATTLEFUL EXISTENCE THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT WAS MARCHED TO RELIEVE A COMMAND THAT HAD LAIN LONG IN SOME DAMP TRENCHES THE MEN TOOK POSITIONS BEHIND A CURVING LINE OF RIFLE PITS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP LIKE A LARGE FURROW
441-130108-0002 HE COULD SEE THE LOW LINE OF TRENCHES BUT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE A FEW IDLE FLAGS WERE PERCHED ON THE DIRT HILLS
441-130108-0003 ALWAYS THE NOISE OF SKIRMISHERS CAME FROM THE WOODS ON THE FRONT AND LEFT AND THE DIN ON THE RIGHT HAD GROWN TO FRIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS THE GUNS WERE ROARING WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE FOR BREATH
441-130108-0004 IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
441-130108-0005 ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
441-130108-0006 LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
441-130108-0007 STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
441-130108-0008 AND IT COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN THAT THEY WERE BEWILDERED BY THE ALLEGED NEWS AND COULD NOT FULLY COMPREHEND A DEFEAT BEFORE THE GRAY MISTS HAD BEEN TOTALLY OBLITERATED BY THE SUN RAYS THE REGIMENT WAS MARCHING IN A SPREAD COLUMN THAT WAS RETIRING CAREFULLY THROUGH THE WOODS
441-130108-0009 THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
441-130108-0010 OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED
441-130108-0011 HE REMARKED SADLY THE YOUTH HAD A THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HANDSOME FOR HIM TO FREELY CONDEMN OTHER MEN HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF BUT THE WORDS UPON HIS TONGUE WERE TOO BITTER
441-130108-0012 HE PRESENTLY BEGAN A LONG AND INTRICATE DENUNCIATION OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES MEBBE IT WA'N'T ALL HIS FAULT NOT ALL TOGETHER
441-130108-0013 IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
441-130108-0014 DON'T WE DO ALL THAT MEN CAN DEMANDED THE YOUTH LOUDLY HE WAS SECRETLY DUMFOUNDED AT THIS SENTIMENT WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS LIPS FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE LOST ITS VALOR AND HE LOOKED GUILTILY ABOUT HIM
441-130108-0015 BUT NO ONE QUESTIONED HIS RIGHT TO DEAL IN SUCH WORDS AND PRESENTLY HE RECOVERED HIS AIR OF COURAGE HE WENT ON TO REPEAT A STATEMENT HE HAD HEARD GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP AT THE CAMP THAT MORNING THE BRIGADIER SAID HE NEVER SAW A NEW REG'MENT FIGHT THE WAY WE FOUGHT YESTIRDAY DIDN'T HE
441-130108-0016 IN HIS REPLY THE FRIEND'S VOICE WAS STERN A COURSE NOT HE SAID
441-130108-0017 BUT STILL STILL WE DON'T HAVE NO LUCK WELL THEN IF WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL AN DON'T EVER WHIP IT MUST BE THE GENERAL'S FAULT SAID THE YOUTH GRANDLY AND DECISIVELY
441-130108-0018 AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
441-130108-0019 THE SPEECH PIERCED THE YOUTH INWARDLY HE WAS REDUCED TO AN ABJECT PULP BY THESE CHANCE WORDS HIS LEGS QUAKED PRIVATELY HE CAST A FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT THE SARCASTIC MAN WHY NO HE HASTENED TO SAY IN A CONCILIATING VOICE
441-130108-0020 I DON'T THINK I FOUGHT THE WHOLE BATTLE YESTERDAY BUT THE OTHER SEEMED INNOCENT OF ANY DEEPER MEANING APPARENTLY HE HAD NO INFORMATION IT WAS MERELY HIS HABIT OH HE REPLIED IN THE SAME TONE OF CALM DERISION
441-130108-0021 THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
441-130108-0022 HE BECAME SUDDENLY A MODEST PERSON THERE WAS LOW TONED TALK AMONG THE TROOPS THE OFFICERS WERE IMPATIENT AND SNAPPY THEIR COUNTENANCES CLOUDED WITH THE TALES OF MISFORTUNE
441-130108-0023 THE TROOPS SIFTING THROUGH THE FOREST WERE SULLEN IN THE YOUTH'S COMPANY ONCE A MAN'S LAUGH RANG OUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS TURNED THEIR FACES QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND FROWNED WITH VAGUE DISPLEASURE
441-130108-0024 THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
441-130108-0025 IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
441-130108-0026 INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
441-130108-0027 SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
441-130108-0028 WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
441-130108-0029 AWAITED THE MOMENT WHEN THE GRAY SHADOWS OF THE WOODS BEFORE THEM SHOULD BE SLASHED BY THE LINES OF FLAME THERE WAS MUCH GROWLING AND SWEARING GOOD GAWD THE YOUTH GRUMBLED WE'RE ALWAYS BEING CHASED AROUND LIKE RATS IT MAKES ME SICK
441-130108-0030 NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
441-130108-0031 NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ETERNAL THUNDERS WE WAS MARCHED INTO THESE WOODS FOR ANYHOW UNLESS IT WAS TO GIVE THE REBS A REGULAR POT SHOT AT US WE CAME IN HERE AND GOT OUR LEGS ALL TANGLED UP IN THESE CUSSED BRIERS
441-130108-0032 AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
441-130108-0033 OH THE DEVIL IT WILL YOU ALWAYS TALK LIKE A DOG HANGED PARSON DON'T TELL ME I KNOW
441-130108-0034 AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP
441-130108-0035 YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
441-130108-0036 LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
441-130108-0037 THE DAY HAD GROWN MORE WHITE UNTIL THE SUN SHED HIS FULL RADIANCE UPON THE THRONGED FOREST A SORT OF A GUST OF BATTLE CAME SWEEPING TOWARD THAT PART OF THE LINE WHERE LAY THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT THE FRONT SHIFTED A TRIFLE TO MEET IT SQUARELY
441-130108-0038 THERE WAS A WAIT IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD THERE PASSED SLOWLY THE INTENSE MOMENTS THAT PRECEDE THE TEMPEST A SINGLE RIFLE FLASHED IN A THICKET BEFORE THE REGIMENT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS JOINED BY MANY OTHERS
441-130108-0039 THERE WAS A MIGHTY SONG OF CLASHES AND CRASHES THAT WENT SWEEPING THROUGH THE WOODS THE GUNS IN THE REAR AROUSED AND ENRAGED BY SHELLS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN BURR LIKE AT THEM SUDDENLY INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN A HIDEOUS ALTERCATION WITH ANOTHER BAND OF GUNS
441-130108-0040 THE BATTLE ROAR SETTLED TO A ROLLING THUNDER WHICH WAS A SINGLE LONG EXPLOSION IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS A PECULIAR KIND OF HESITATION DENOTED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE MEN
441-130108-0041 THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
6385-34669-0000 CHAPTER ONE A WATCH DOG MAY BE A GUARDIAN ANGEL GWYNPLAINE UTTERED A CRY IS THAT YOU WOLF HOMO WAGGED HIS TAIL HIS EYES SPARKLED IN THE DARKNESS HE WAS LOOKING EARNESTLY AT GWYNPLAINE
6385-34669-0001 THEN HE BEGAN TO LICK HIS HANDS AGAIN FOR A MOMENT GWYNPLAINE WAS LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN SO GREAT IS THE SHOCK OF HOPE'S MIGHTY RETURN HOMO
6385-34669-0002 OR AT LEAST THE LIGHT WHICH LEADS TO IT REGAINED THE SUDDEN INTERVENTION OF SOME MYSTERIOUS CLEMENCY POSSESSED PERHAPS BY DESTINY LIFE SAYING BEHOLD ME IN THE DARKEST RECESS OF THE GRAVE
6385-34669-0003 THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH ALL EXPECTATION HAS CEASED BRINGING BACK HEALTH AND DELIVERANCE A PLACE OF SAFETY DISCOVERED AT THE MOST CRITICAL INSTANT IN THE MIDST OF CRUMBLING RUINS HOMO WAS ALL THIS TO GWYNPLAINE THE WOLF APPEARED TO HIM
6385-34669-0004 IN A HALO OF LIGHT MEANWHILE HOMO HAD TURNED ROUND HE ADVANCED A FEW STEPS AND THEN LOOKED BACK TO SEE IF GWYNPLAINE WAS FOLLOWING HIM GWYNPLAINE WAS DOING SO HOMO WAGGED HIS TAIL AND WENT ON
6385-34669-0005 AND GWYNPLAINE GUIDED BY HOMO DESCENDED IT HOMO TURNED HIS HEAD NOW AND THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT GWYNPLAINE WAS BEHIND HIM IN SOME SITUATIONS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE NOTHING APPROACHES SO NEAR AN OMNISCIENT INTELLIGENCE
6385-34669-0006 AS THE SIMPLE INSTINCT OF A FAITHFUL ANIMAL AN ANIMAL IS A LUCID SOMNAMBULIST THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH THE DOG FEELS THAT HE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS MASTER OTHERS IN WHICH HE SHOULD PRECEDE HIM THEN THE ANIMAL TAKES THE DIRECTION OF SENSE
6385-34669-0007 HIS IMPERTURBABLE SCENT IS A CONFUSED POWER OF VISION IN WHAT IS TWILIGHT TO US HE FEELS A VAGUE OBLIGATION TO BECOME A GUIDE DOES HE KNOW THAT THERE IS A DANGEROUS PASS AND THAT HE CAN HELP HIS MASTER TO SURMOUNT IT
6385-34669-0008 PROBABLY NOT PERHAPS HE DOES IN ANY CASE SOME ONE KNOWS IT FOR HIM AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN LIFE THAT SOME MIGHTY HELP
6385-34669-0009 WHICH WE HAVE HELD TO HAVE COME FROM BELOW HAS IN REALITY COME FROM ABOVE WHO KNOWS ALL THE MYSTERIOUS FORMS ASSUMED BY GOD WHAT WAS THIS ANIMAL PROVIDENCE HAVING REACHED THE RIVER
6385-34669-0010 WITHOUT NOISE OR BARK HE PUSHED FORWARD ON HIS SILENT WAY HOMO ALWAYS FOLLOWED HIS INSTINCT AND DID HIS DUTY BUT WITH THE PENSIVE RESERVE OF AN OUTLAW SOME FIFTY PACES MORE AND HE STOPPED
6385-34669-0011 A WOODEN PLATFORM APPEARED ON THE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PLATFORM WHICH WAS A KIND OF WHARF ON PILES
6385-34669-0012 A BLACK MASS COULD BE MADE OUT WHICH WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE VESSEL ON THE DECK OF THE VESSEL NEAR THE PROW WAS A GLIMMER LIKE THE LAST FLICKER OF A NIGHT LIGHT
6385-34669-0013 WAS A DUTCH VESSEL OF THE JAPANESE BUILD WITH TWO DECKS FORE AND AFT AND BETWEEN THEM AN OPEN HOLD REACHED BY AN UPRIGHT LADDER IN WHICH THE CARGO WAS LADEN
6385-34669-0014 THERE WAS THUS A FORECASTLE AND AN AFTERDECK AS IN OUR OLD RIVER BOATS AND A SPACE BETWEEN THEM BALLASTED BY THE FREIGHT THE PAPER BOATS MADE BY CHILDREN ARE OF A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR SHAPE UNDER THE DECKS WERE THE CABINS
6385-34669-0015 THE DOORS OF WHICH OPENED INTO THE HOLD AND WERE LIGHTED BY GLAZED PORTHOLES IN STOWING THE CARGO A PASSAGE WAS LEFT BETWEEN THE PACKAGES OF WHICH IT CONSISTED THESE VESSELS HAD A MAST ON EACH DECK THE FOREMAST WAS CALLED PAUL
6385-34669-0016 BOTH FLAPS OF THE GANGWAY WERE LOWERED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT ON HINGES THUS MAKING A ROOF OVER THE HOLD SO THAT THE SHIP IN HEAVY SEAS WAS HERMETICALLY CLOSED THESE SLOOPS BEING OF VERY MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION HAD A BEAM FOR A TILLER
6385-34669-0017 THE STRENGTH OF THE RUDDER BEING NECESSARILY PROPORTIONED TO THE HEIGHT OF THE VESSEL THREE MEN THE SKIPPER AND TWO SAILORS WITH A CABIN BOY SUFFICED TO NAVIGATE THESE PONDEROUS SEA GOING MACHINES THE DECKS FORE AND AFT
6385-34669-0018 THE GREAT LUMBERING HULL OF THIS PARTICULAR VESSEL WAS PAINTED BLACK AND ON IT VISIBLE EVEN IN THE NIGHT STOOD OUT IN WHITE LETTERS THE WORDS VOGRAAT ROTTERDAM
6385-34669-0019 ABOUT THAT TIME MANY EVENTS HAD OCCURRED AT SEA AND AMONGST OTHERS THE DEFEAT OF THE BARON DE POINTI'S EIGHT SHIPS OFF CAPE CARNERO WHICH HAD DRIVEN THE WHOLE FRENCH FLEET INTO REFUGE AT GIBRALTAR SO THAT THE CHANNEL WAS SWEPT OF EVERY MAN OF WAR
6385-34669-0020 AND MERCHANT VESSELS WERE ABLE TO SAIL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN LONDON AND ROTTERDAM WITHOUT A CONVOY THE VESSEL ON WHICH WAS TO BE READ THE WORD VOGRAAT AND WHICH GWYNPLAINE WAS NOW CLOSE TO LAY WITH HER MAIN DECK ALMOST LEVEL WITH THE WHARF
6385-34669-0021 BUT ONE STEP TO DESCEND AND HOMO IN A BOUND AND GWYNPLAINE IN A STRIDE WERE ON BOARD THE DECK WAS CLEAR AND NO STIR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE PASSENGERS IF AS WAS LIKELY THERE WERE ANY WERE ALREADY ON BOARD
6385-34669-0022 THE VESSEL BEING READY TO SAIL AND THE CARGO STOWED AS WAS APPARENT FROM THE STATE OF THE HOLD WHICH WAS FULL OF BALES AND CASES BUT THEY WERE DOUBTLESS LYING ASLEEP IN THE CABINS BELOW AS THE PASSAGE WAS TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE NIGHT
6385-34669-0023 IN SUCH CASES THE PASSENGERS DO NOT APPEAR ON DECK TILL THEY AWAKE THE FOLLOWING MORNING AS FOR THE CREW THEY WERE PROBABLY HAVING THEIR SUPPER IN THE MEN'S CABIN WHILST AWAITING THE HOUR FIXED FOR SAILING WHICH WAS NOW RAPIDLY APPROACHING HENCE
6385-34669-0024 THE SILENCE ON THE TWO DECKS CONNECTED BY THE GANGWAY THE WOLF HAD ALMOST RUN ACROSS THE WHARF ONCE ON BOARD HE SLACKENED HIS PACE INTO A DISCREET WALK HE STILL WAGGED HIS TAIL NO LONGER JOYFULLY HOWEVER
6385-34669-0025 THIS POOR WOODEN TENEMENT CART AND HUT COMBINED IN WHICH HIS CHILDHOOD HAD ROLLED ALONG WAS FASTENED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MAST BY THICK ROPES OF WHICH THE KNOTS WERE VISIBLE AT THE WHEELS HAVING BEEN SO LONG OUT OF SERVICE IT HAD BECOME DREADFULLY RICKETY
6385-34669-0026 IT LEANT OVER FEEBLY ON ONE SIDE IT HAD BECOME QUITE PARALYTIC FROM DISUSE AND MOREOVER IT WAS SUFFERING FROM THAT INCURABLE MALADY OLD AGE MOULDY AND OUT OF SHAPE IT TOTTERED IN DECAY
6385-34669-0027 THE IRON WAS RUSTY THE LEATHER TORN THE WOOD WORK WORM EATEN THERE WERE LINES OF CRACKS ACROSS THE WINDOW IN FRONT THROUGH WHICH SHONE A RAY FROM THE LANTERN THE WHEELS WERE WARPED THE LINING THE FLOOR
6385-34669-0028 AND THE AXLETREES SEEMED WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE ALTOGETHER IT PRESENTED AN INDESCRIBABLE APPEARANCE OF BEGGARY AND PROSTRATION THE SHAFTS STUCK UP LOOKED LIKE TWO ARMS RAISED TO HEAVEN
6385-34669-0029 THE WHOLE THING WAS IN A STATE OF DISLOCATION BENEATH IT WAS HANGING HOMO'S CHAIN
6385-34669-0030 DOES IT NOT SEEM THAT THE LAW AND THE WILL OF NATURE WOULD HAVE DICTATED GWYNPLAINE'S HEADLONG RUSH TO THROW HIMSELF UPON LIFE HAPPINESS LOVE REGAINED SO THEY WOULD
6385-34669-0031 HESITATES LEST HE SHOULD BEAR THE FATALITY OF WHICH HE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM TO THOSE WHOM HE LOVES FEELS THAT SOME EVIL CONTAGION MAY STILL HANG ABOUT HIM AND ADVANCES TOWARDS HAPPINESS WITH WARY STEPS
6385-34669-0032 THE GATES OF PARADISE REOPEN BUT BEFORE HE ENTERS HE EXAMINES HIS GROUND
6385-34655-0000 THE RESEMBLANCE OF A PALACE TO A WOOD IN PALACES AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION AND CORLEONE LODGE WAS ONE THERE WERE VERY FEW DOORS BUT ABUNDANCE OF TAPESTRY SCREENS AND CURTAINED DOORWAYS
6385-34655-0001 IN EVERY PALACE OF THAT DATE THERE WAS A WONDERFUL LABYRINTH OF CHAMBERS AND CORRIDORS WHERE LUXURY RAN RIOT GILDING MARBLE CARVED WAINSCOTING
6385-34655-0002 EASTERN SILKS NOOKS AND CORNERS SOME SECRET AND DARK AS NIGHT OTHERS LIGHT AND PLEASANT AS THE DAY THERE WERE ATTICS RICHLY AND BRIGHTLY FURNISHED BURNISHED RECESSES SHINING WITH DUTCH TILES AND PORTUGUESE AZULEJOS
6385-34655-0003 THE TOPS OF THE HIGH WINDOWS WERE CONVERTED INTO SMALL ROOMS AND GLASS ATTICS FORMING PRETTY HABITABLE LANTERNS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WAS SUCH THAT THERE WERE ROOMS WITHIN THEM HERE AND THERE WERE CLOSETS
6385-34655-0004 NOMINALLY WARDROBES THEY WERE CALLED THE LITTLE ROOMS IT WAS WITHIN THEM THAT EVIL DEEDS WERE HATCHED
6385-34655-0005 OR THE CRIES OF LITTLE GIRLS BROUGHT THITHER BY LEBEL SMOTHERED SUCH PLACES WERE CONVENIENT FOR THE PURPOSE THEY WERE LABYRINTHINE CHAMBERS IMPRACTICABLE TO A STRANGER SCENES OF ABDUCTIONS UNKNOWN DEPTHS
6385-34655-0006 RECEPTACLES OF MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES IN THOSE ELEGANT CAVERNS PRINCES AND LORDS STORED THEIR PLUNDER IN SUCH A PLACE THE COUNT DE CHAROLAIS HID MADAME COURCHAMP THE WIFE OF THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL
6385-34655-0007 THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM POOR PENNYWELL ET CETERA THE DEEDS DONE THERE WERE SUCH AS WERE DESIGNATED BY THE ROMAN LAW AS COMMITTED VI CLAM ET PRECARIO BY FORCE IN SECRET AND FOR A SHORT TIME
6385-34655-0008 ONCE IN AN OCCUPANT REMAINED THERE TILL THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE DECREED HIS OR HER RELEASE THEY WERE GILDED OUBLIETTES SAVOURING BOTH OF THE CLOISTER AND THE HAREM THEIR STAIRCASES TWISTED TURNED
6385-34655-0009 LED BACK TO THE STARTING POINT
6385-34655-0010 PERHAPS THE ARCHITECTS OF THE LITTLE ROOMS BUILDING FOR ROYALTY AND ARISTOCRACY TOOK AS MODELS THE RAMIFICATIONS OF CORAL BEDS AND THE OPENINGS IN A SPONGE THE BRANCHES BECAME A LABYRINTH PICTURES
6385-34655-0011 TURNING ON FALSE PANELS WERE EXITS AND ENTRANCES THEY WERE FULL OF STAGE CONTRIVANCES AND NO WONDER CONSIDERING THE DRAMAS THAT WERE PLAYED THERE THE FLOORS OF THESE HIVES REACHED FROM THE CELLARS TO THE ATTICS
6385-34655-0012 FROM VERSAILLES DOWNWARDS LIKE CELLS OF PYGMIES IN DWELLING PLACES OF TITANS PASSAGES NICHES ALCOVES AND SECRET RECESSES
6385-34655-0013 THESE WINDING AND NARROW PASSAGES RECALLED GAMES BLINDFOLDED EYES HANDS FEELING IN THE DARK SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER BLIND MAN'S BUFF HIDE AND SEEK WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SUGGESTED MEMORIES
6385-34655-0014 THE BRUTAL KNIGHTS OF ELTZ OF RIZZIO OF MONALDESCHI OF NAKED SWORDS PURSUING THE FUGITIVE FLYING FROM ROOM TO ROOM THE ANCIENTS TOO HAD MYSTERIOUS RETREATS OF THE SAME KIND IN WHICH LUXURY WAS ADAPTED TO ENORMITIES
6385-34655-0015 THE MAZE OF PASSAGES AND ALCOVES WITH SECRET AND BEWILDERING DOORS CHECKED AND RETARDED HIS PROGRESS HE STROVE TO RUN HE WAS OBLIGED TO WANDER HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BUT ONE DOOR TO THRUST OPEN WHILE HE HAD A SKEIN OF DOORS TO UNRAVEL
6385-34655-0016 TO ONE ROOM SUCCEEDED ANOTHER THEN A CROSSWAY WITH ROOMS ON EVERY SIDE NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN HE LISTENED NOT A SOUND
6385-34655-0017 AT TIMES HE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BE RETURNING TOWARDS HIS STARTING POINT THEN THAT HE SAW SOME ONE APPROACHING IT WAS NO ONE IT WAS ONLY THE REFLECTION OF HIMSELF IN A MIRROR DRESSED AS A NOBLEMAN THAT HE IMPOSSIBLE
6385-34655-0018 THEN HE RECOGNIZED HIMSELF BUT NOT AT ONCE HE EXPLORED EVERY PASSAGE THAT HE CAME TO HE EXAMINED THE QUAINT ARRANGEMENTS OF THE RAMBLING BUILDING AND THEIR YET QUAINTER FITTINGS HERE A CABINET
6385-34655-0019 PAINTED AND CARVED IN A SENTIMENTAL BUT VICIOUS STYLE THERE AN EQUIVOCAL LOOKING CHAPEL STUDDED WITH ENAMELS AND MOTHER OF PEARL WITH MINIATURES ON IVORY WROUGHT OUT IN RELIEF LIKE THOSE ON OLD FASHIONED SNUFF BOXES THERE
6385-34655-0020 ONE OF THOSE PRETTY FLORENTINE RETREATS ADAPTED TO THE HYPOCHONDRIASIS OF WOMEN AND EVEN THEN CALLED BOUDOIRS EVERYWHERE ON THE CEILINGS ON THE WALLS AND ON THE VERY FLOORS WERE REPRESENTATIONS
6385-34655-0021 IN VELVET OR IN METAL OF BIRDS OF TREES OF LUXURIANT VEGETATION PICKED OUT IN RELIEFS OF LACEWORK TABLES COVERED WITH JET CARVINGS
6385-34655-0022 REPRESENTING WARRIORS QUEENS AND TRITONS ARMED WITH THE SCALY TERMINATIONS OF A HYDRA CUT CRYSTALS COMBINING PRISMATIC EFFECTS WITH THOSE OF REFLECTION MIRRORS REPEATED THE LIGHT OF PRECIOUS STONES AND SPARKLES GLITTERED IN THE DARKEST CORNERS
6385-34655-0023 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS WHETHER THOSE MANY SIDED SHINING SURFACES WHERE EMERALD GREEN MINGLED WITH THE GOLDEN HUES OF THE RISING SUN WHERE FLOATED A GLIMMER OF EVER VARYING COLOURS LIKE THOSE ON A PIGEON'S NECK WERE MINIATURE MIRRORS OR ENORMOUS BERYLS
6385-34655-0024 EVERYWHERE WAS MAGNIFICENCE AT ONCE REFINED AND STUPENDOUS IF IT WAS NOT THE MOST DIMINUTIVE OF PALACES IT WAS THE MOST GIGANTIC OF JEWEL CASES A HOUSE FOR MAB OR A JEWEL FOR GEO
6385-34655-0025 GWYNPLAINE SOUGHT AN EXIT HE COULD NOT FIND ONE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE OUT HIS WAY THERE IS NOTHING SO CONFUSING AS WEALTH SEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME MOREOVER
6385-34655-0026 THIS WAS A LABYRINTH AT EACH STEP HE WAS STOPPED BY SOME MAGNIFICENT OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO RETARD HIS EXIT AND TO BE UNWILLING TO LET HIM PASS HE WAS ENCOMPASSED BY A NET OF WONDERS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AND HELD BACK
6385-34655-0027 WHAT A HORRIBLE PALACE HE THOUGHT RESTLESS HE WANDERED THROUGH THE MAZE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT IT ALL MEANT
6385-34655-0028 AND MUST BE HELD UNBROKEN TO GUIDE HIM OUT OF IT NOW AND THEN HE SHOUTED HO ANY ONE THERE NO ONE ANSWERED THE ROOMS NEVER CAME TO AN END ALL WAS DESERTED SILENT SPLENDID SINISTER
6385-34655-0029 IT REALIZED THE FABLES OF ENCHANTED CASTLES HIDDEN PIPES OF HOT AIR MAINTAINED A SUMMER TEMPERATURE IN THE BUILDING IT WAS AS IF SOME MAGICIAN HAD CAUGHT UP THE MONTH OF JUNE AND IMPRISONED IT IN A LABYRINTH THERE WERE PLEASANT ODOURS NOW AND THEN
6385-34655-0030 AND HE CROSSED CURRENTS OF PERFUME AS THOUGH PASSING BY INVISIBLE FLOWERS IT WAS WARM CARPETS EVERYWHERE ONE MIGHT HAVE WALKED ABOUT THERE UNCLOTHED GWYNPLAINE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS THE VIEW FROM EACH ONE WAS DIFFERENT
6385-34655-0031 FROM ONE HE BEHELD GARDENS SPARKLING WITH THE FRESHNESS OF A SPRING MORNING FROM ANOTHER A PLOT DECKED WITH STATUES FROM A THIRD A PATIO IN THE SPANISH STYLE A LITTLE SQUARE
6385-34655-0032 HE STOOD STILL AND LISTENED OH I WILL GET OUT OF THIS PLACE SAID HE
6385-34655-0033 THEY SHALL NOT KEEP ME HERE BY FORCE WOE TO HIM WHO BARS MY EXIT WHAT IS THAT GREAT TOWER YONDER IF THERE WAS A GIANT A HELL HOUND A MINOTAUR TO KEEP THE GATE OF THIS ENCHANTED PALACE I WOULD ANNIHILATE HIM IF AN ARMY I WOULD EXTERMINATE IT
6385-34655-0034 SUDDENLY HE HEARD A GENTLE NOISE VERY FAINT IT WAS LIKE DROPPING WATER HE WAS IN A DARK NARROW PASSAGE CLOSED SOME FEW PACES FURTHER ON BY A CURTAIN HE ADVANCED TO THE CURTAIN
6385-34655-0035 PUSHED IT ASIDE ENTERED
3947-13262-0000 HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
3947-13262-0001 SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
3947-13262-0002 WE LOOKED OVER A GOOD MANY IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME WHERE VIRGINIA HAS MANAGED TO GET ALL HER IDEAS ABOUT THIS WORK VIRGINIA KNOWS MORE NOW ABOUT ARNOLD TOYNBEE AND EAST END LONDON AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN AMERICA
3947-13262-0003 THAN A GOOD MANY PROFESSIONAL SLUM WORKERS SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING NEARLY ALL SUMMER IN GETTING INFORMATION ROLLIN WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE AT EASE AS THEY TALKED OVER THIS COMING WORK OF HUMANITY IT WAS SAFE COMMON GROUND
3947-13262-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
3947-13262-0005 I HAVE BEEN BUSY REPLIED ROLLIN BRIEFLY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT PERSISTED RACHEL YOU SAY SO LITTLE
3947-13262-0006 SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
3947-13262-0007 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
3947-13262-0008 I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SAME COMPANY TO WHICH YOU AND VIRGINIA BELONG CONTINUED ROLLIN BEGINNING AGAIN I HAVE MADE THE PLEDGE TO DO AS I BELIEVE JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0009 AND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MEN
3947-13262-0010 YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
3947-13262-0011 WHAT PURPOSE I COULD NOW HAVE IN MY LIFE TO REDEEM IT TO SATISFY MY THOUGHT OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP AND THE MORE I THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE I WAS DRIVEN TO A PLACE WHERE I KNEW I MUST TAKE UP THE CROSS
3947-13262-0012 DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
3947-13262-0013 THE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHEN
3947-13262-0014 BUT THE FASHIONABLE DISSIPATED YOUNG MEN AROUND TOWN THE CLUB MEN ARE LEFT OUT OF ALL PLANS FOR REACHING AND CHRISTIANIZING AND YET NO CLASS OF PEOPLE NEED IT MORE I SAID TO MYSELF I KNOW THESE MEN THEIR GOOD AND THEIR BAD QUALITIES I HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEM
3947-13262-0015 I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
3947-13262-0016 WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
3947-13262-0017 ROLLIN'S VOICE WAS SO LOW ON THIS LAST SENTENCE THAT RACHEL HAD DIFFICULTY IN HEARING HIM ABOVE THE NOISE AROUND THEM BUT SHE KNEW WHAT HE HAD SAID SHE WANTED TO ASK WHAT HIS METHODS WERE BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO ASK HIM
3947-13262-0018 HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
3947-13262-0019 THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
3947-13262-0020 RACHEL HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT DAY AND ROLLIN COULD NOT SHE FINALLY BROKE A LONG SILENCE BY ASKING WHAT SHE HAD NOT FOUND WORDS FOR BEFORE
3947-13262-0021 IN YOUR WORK WITH THE CLUB MEN WITH YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO THEY GIVE YOU HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM WHAT DO THEY SAY ROLLIN WAS RELIEVED WHEN RACHEL SPOKE HE ANSWERED QUICKLY OH IT DEPENDS ON THE MAN
3947-13262-0022 A GOOD MANY OF THEM THINK I AM A CRANK I HAVE KEPT MY MEMBERSHIP UP AND AM IN GOOD STANDING IN THAT WAY I TRY TO BE WISE AND NOT PROVOKE ANY UNNECESSARY CRITICISM BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE MEN HAVE RESPONDED TO MY APPEAL
3947-13262-0023 I COULD HARDLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT ONLY A FEW NIGHTS AGO A DOZEN MEN BECAME HONESTLY AND EARNESTLY ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION OVER RELIGIOUS MATTERS I HAVE HAD THE GREAT JOY OF SEEING SOME OF THE MEN GIVE UP BAD HABITS AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0024 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO I KEEP ASKING IT THE ANSWER COMES SLOWLY FOR I AM FEELING MY WAY SLOWLY ONE THING I HAVE FOUND OUT THE MEN ARE NOT FIGHTING SHY OF ME I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGN
3947-13262-0025 ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
3947-13262-0026 ROLLIN SPOKE WITH ENTHUSIASM HIS FACE WAS TRANSFORMED BY HIS INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A PART OF HIS REAL LIFE RACHEL AGAIN NOTED THE STRONG MANLY TONE OF HIS SPEECH
3947-13262-0027 WITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0028 DO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAY
3947-13262-0029 I FEEL THE NEED OF SAYING IN JUSTICE TO YOU NOW THAT I HONOR YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND YOUR OBEDIENCE TO THE PROMISE YOU HAVE MADE AS YOU INTERPRET THE PROMISE THE LIFE YOU ARE LIVING IS A NOBLE ONE ROLLIN TREMBLED HIS AGITATION WAS GREATER THAN HE COULD CONTROL
3947-13262-0030 RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
3947-13262-0031 SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
3947-13262-0032 I AM BEGINNING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE LOVED BY A NOBLE MAN I SHALL LOVE ROLLIN PAGE AFTER ALL WHAT AM I SAYING RACHEL WINSLOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN SHE ROSE AND WALKED BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
3947-13262-0033 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
3947-13262-0034 IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
3947-13262-0035 AND ROLLIN AS HE WENT BACK TREASURED A HOPE THAT HAD BEEN A STRANGER TO HIM SINCE RACHEL HAD SAID NO THAT DAY
3947-13262-0036 IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
3947-13262-0037 THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
3947-13262-0038 BUT THE BUILDING OF HOUSES IN THE FIELD THE TRANSFORMING OF ITS BLEAK BARE ASPECT INTO AN ATTRACTIVE PARK ALL OF WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN HER PLAN WAS A WORK TOO LARGE TO BE COMPLETED THAT FALL AFTER SHE HAD SECURED THE PROPERTY
3947-13262-0039 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
3947-13262-0040 OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLY
3947-13262-0041 YET HE WALKED HOME THOUGHTFULLY AND ON HIS WAY HE COULD NOT AVOID THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUAL PROBLEM THRUST UPON HIS NOTICE BY THE SALOON HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE FOR THE RECTANGLE AFTER ALL
3947-13262-0042 EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
3947-13262-0043 OF COURSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE REDEMPTIVE WORK BEGUN AND CARRIED ON BY THE HOLY SPIRIT IN HIS WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF POWER IN THE FIRST CHURCH AND IN THE TENT MEETINGS HAD HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE LIFE OF RAYMOND
3947-13262-0044 BUT AS HE WALKED PAST SALOON AFTER SALOON AND NOTED THE CROWDS GOING IN AND COMING OUT OF THEM AS HE SAW THE WRETCHED DENS AS MANY AS EVER APPARENTLY
3947-13262-0045 HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
3947-13262-0046 WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
3947-13262-0047 WAS IT NOT A PRACTICAL WASTE OF BEAUTIFUL LIVES FOR THESE YOUNG WOMEN TO THROW THEMSELVES INTO THIS EARTHLY HELL WHEN FOR EVERY SOUL RESCUED BY THEIR SACRIFICE THE SALOON MADE TWO MORE THAT NEEDED RESCUE HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE QUESTION
3947-13262-0048 IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
3947-13262-0049 HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0050 HENRY MAXWELL STANDING AT THE VERY CENTRE OF THE MOVEMENT WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO JUDGE OF ITS POWER AS SOME ONE FROM THE OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE DONE BUT RAYMOND ITSELF FELT THE TOUCH IN VERY MANY WAYS NOT KNOWING ALL THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGE
3947-13262-0051 THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW
6531-61334-0000 THE SLEEPERS OPEN THEIR EYES AND RAISE THEMSELVES ON THEIR ELBOWS THEN THE SHEPHERD HEARS A WARNING VOICE WHICH COMES AND GOES LIKE THE WIND SAYING IF THE HORN IS BLOWN ONCE AGAIN THE WORLD WILL BE UPSET ALTOGETHER
6531-61334-0001 TERRIFIED BY THE VOICE AND THE FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE OF THE HEROES THE SHEPHERD RETREATS HURRIEDLY LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
6531-61334-0002 SHALMANESER SHAMASH ADAD ASHUR DAN
6531-61334-0003 THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES HAD GROWN ONCE AGAIN POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS BUT NO GREAT LEADER LIKE SUBBILULIUMA AROSE TO WELD THE VARIOUS STATES INTO AN EMPIRE
6531-61334-0004 SO AS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE MINGLED PEOPLES FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THE AGGRESSIVE AND AMBITIOUS WAR LORDS OF ASSYRIA ONE KINGDOM HAD ITS CAPITAL AT HAMATH AND ANOTHER AT CARCHEMISH ON THE EUPHRATES THE KINGDOM OF TABAL FLOURISHED IN CILICIA KHILAKKU
6531-61334-0005 IT INCLUDED SEVERAL CITY STATES LIKE TARSUS TIANA AND COMANA KAMMANU FARTHER WEST WAS THE DOMINION OF THE THRACO PHRYGIAN MUSKI THE TRIBES ROUND THE SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0006 HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0007 THE NORTHERN FRONTIER OF ASSYRIA WAS CONTINUALLY MENACED BY GROUPS OF INDEPENDENT HILL STATES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE HAD THEY OPERATED TOGETHER AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY BUT WERE LIABLE TO BE EXTINGUISHED WHEN ATTACKED IN DETAIL
6531-61334-0008 A NUMBER OF ARAMAEAN KINGDOMS HAD COME INTO EXISTENCE IN MESOPOTAMIA AND THROUGHOUT SYRIA
6531-61334-0009 WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0010 GROUPS OF THE ARAMAEANS HAD ACQUIRED A HIGH DEGREE OF CULTURE AND BECOME TRADERS AND ARTISANS
6531-61334-0011 ACCUSTOMED FOR GENERATIONS TO DESERT WARFARE THEY WERE FEARLESS WARRIORS THEIR ARMIES HAD GREAT MOBILITY BEING COMPOSED MOSTLY OF MOUNTED INFANTRY AND WERE NOT EASILY OVERPOWERED BY THE ASSYRIAN FORCES OF FOOTMEN
6531-61334-0012 THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
6531-61334-0013 OPERATED IN SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0014 IN THE NORTH HE HAD TO DRIVE BACK INVADING BANDS OF THE MUSKI
6531-61334-0015 A SURE INDICATION THAT ASSYRIA WAS ONCE AGAIN BECOMING POWERFUL IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE REGIONS TOWARDS ARMENIA ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0016 INAUGURATED A VERITABLE REIGN OF TERROR IN MESOPOTAMIA AND NORTHERN SYRIA HIS METHODS OF DEALING WITH REVOLTING TRIBES WERE OF A MOST SAVAGE CHARACTER CHIEFS WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND WHEN HE SACKED THEIR CITIES
6531-61334-0017 NOT ONLY FIGHTING MEN BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EITHER SLAUGHTERED OR BURNED AT THE STAKE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEREFORE THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE KINGS OF PETTY STATES MADE SUBMISSION TO HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS SOON AS HE INVADED THEIR DOMAINS
6531-61334-0018 IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE OVERRAN THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT BETWEEN LAKE VAN AND THE UPPER SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS BUBU THE REBEL SON OF THE GOVERNOR OF NISHTUN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARBELA WHERE HE WAS SKINNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0019 LIKE HIS FATHER ASHUR NATSIR PAL FOUGHT AGAINST THE MUSKI WHOSE POWER WAS DECLINING THEN HE TURNED SOUTHWARD FROM THE BORDERS OF ASIA MINOR AND DEALT WITH A REBELLION IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AN ARAMAEAN PRETENDER NAMED AKHIABABA
6531-61334-0020 HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AT SURU IN THE REGION TO THE EAST OF THE EUPHRATES ENCLOSED BY ITS TRIBUTARIES THE KHABAR AND THE BALIKH HE HAD COME FROM THE NEIGHBOURING ARAMAEAN STATE OF BIT ADINI AND WAS PREPARING IT WOULD APPEAR
6531-61334-0021 TO FORM A POWERFUL CONFEDERACY AGAINST THE ASSYRIANS WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL APPROACHED SURU A PART OF ITS POPULATION WELCOMED HIM HE ENTERED THE CITY SEIZED THE PRETENDER AND MANY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
6531-61334-0022 THESE HE DISPOSED OF WITH CHARACTERISTIC BARBARITY SOME WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND SOME IMPALED ON STAKES WHILE OTHERS WERE ENCLOSED IN A PILLAR WHICH THE KING HAD ERECTED TO REMIND THE ARAMAEANS OF HIS DETERMINATION TO BROOK NO OPPOSITION
6531-61334-0023 AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN FLAYED THEIR SKINS WERE NAILED UPON THE CITY WALLS ANOTHER REVOLT BROKE OUT IN THE KIRKHI DISTRICT BETWEEN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE TIGRIS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0024 IT WAS PROMOTED BY THE NAIRI TRIBES AND EVEN SUPPORTED BY SOME ASSYRIAN OFFICIALS TERRIBLE REPRISALS WERE METED OUT TO THE REBELS WHEN THE CITY OF KINABU WAS CAPTURED NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND PRISONERS WERE BURNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0025 THE UNFAITHFUL GOVERNOR BEING FLAYED THE CITY OF DAMDAMUSA WAS SET ON FIRE THEN TELA WAS ATTACKED ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE OPERATIONS RUNS AS FOLLOWS
6531-61334-0026 THE CITY OF TELLO WAS VERY STRONG
6531-61334-0027 THEY DID NOT COME DOWN OR EMBRACE MY FEET WITH BATTLE AND SLAUGHTER I ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE CITY THREE THOUSAND WARRIORS I SLEW IN BATTLE THEIR BOOTY AND POSSESSIONS CATTLE SHEEP I CARRIED AWAY
6531-61334-0028 MANY CAPTIVES I BURNED WITH FIRE MANY OF THEIR SOLDIERS I TOOK ALIVE OF SOME I CUT OFF HANDS AND LIMBS OF OTHERS THE NOSES EARS AND ARMS OF MANY SOLDIERS I PUT OUT THE EYES
6531-61334-0029 I REARED A COLUMN OF THE LIVING AND A COLUMN OF HEADS I HUNG ON HIGH THEIR HEADS ON TREES IN THE VICINITY OF THEIR CITY THEIR BOYS AND GIRLS I BURNED UP IN FLAMES I DEVASTATED THE CITY DUG IT UP IN FIRE BURNED IT
6531-61334-0030 HE WAS SO GREATLY FEARED BY THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THEIR TERRITORY THEY SENT HIM TRIBUTE YIELDING WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
6531-61334-0031 FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE GREAT CONQUEROR ENGAGED HIMSELF IN THUS SUBDUING REBELLIOUS TRIBES AND EXTENDING HIS TERRITORY HIS MILITARY HEADQUARTERS WERE AT KALKHI TO WHICH CITY THE COURT HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED
6531-61334-0032 THITHER HE DRAFTED THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHOM HE INCORPORATED IN THE ASSYRIAN ARMY ASSYRIAN COLONIES WERE ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS FOR STRATEGICAL PURPOSES AND OFFICIALS SUPPLANTED THE PETTY KINGS IN CERTAIN OF THE NORTHERN CITY STATES
6531-61334-0033 THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA GAVE MUCH TROUBLE TO ASHUR NATSIR PAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD LAID A HEAVY HAND ON SURU THE SOUTHERN TRIBES THE SUKHI STIRRED UP REVOLTS IN MESOPOTAMIA AS THE ALLIES OF THE BABYLONIANS
6531-61334-0034 ON ONE OCCASION ASHUR NATSIR PAL SWEPT SOUTHWARD THROUGH THIS REGION AND ATTACKED A COMBINED FORCE OF SUKHI ARAMAEANS AND BABYLONIANS THE BABYLONIANS WERE COMMANDED BY ZABDANU
6531-61334-0035 WHO WAS EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE WESTERN TRADE ROUTE THE ASSYRIAN WAR LORD HOWEVER PROVED TO BE TOO POWERFUL A RIVAL HE ACHIEVED SO COMPLETE A VICTORY
6531-61334-0036 THE PEOPLE OF KASHSHI BABYLONIA AND KALDU CHALDAEA WERE STRICKEN WITH TERROR AND HAD TO AGREE TO PAY INCREASED TRIBUTE
6531-61334-0037 REIGNED FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
6531-61334-0038 HAVING ACCUMULATED GREAT BOOTY HE ENGAGED HIMSELF AS SOON AS PEACE WAS SECURED THROUGHOUT HIS EMPIRE IN REBUILDING THE CITY OF KALKHI WHERE HE ERECTED A GREAT PALACE AND MADE RECORDS OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
6531-61334-0039 HE ALSO EXTENDED AND REDECORATED THE ROYAL PALACE AT NINEVEH AND DEVOTED MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TEMPLES TRIBUTE POURED IN FROM THE SUBJECT STATES THE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY TRIBES IN THE NORTH FURNISHED IN ABUNDANCE WINE AND CORN
6531-61334-0040 SHEEP AND CATTLE AND HORSES AND FROM THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA AND THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES CAME MUCH SILVER AND GOLD COPPER AND LEAD JEWELS AND IVORY AS WELL AS RICHLY DECORATED FURNITURE ARMOUR AND WEAPONS
6531-61334-0041 ARTISTS AND ARTISANS WERE ALSO PROVIDED BY THE VASSALS OF ASSYRIA THERE ARE TRACES OF PHOENICIAN INFLUENCE IN THE ART OF THIS PERIOD ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S GREAT PALACE AT KALKHI WAS EXCAVATED BY LAYARD
6531-61334-0042 WHO HAS GIVEN A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE VERDANT PLAIN ON WHICH THE ANCIENT CITY WAS SITUATED AS IT APPEARED IN SPRING ITS PASTURE LANDS KNOWN AS THE JAIF ARE RENOWNED HE WROTE
6531-61334-0043 IN THE EVENING AFTER THE LABOUR OF THE DAY I OFTEN SAT AT THE DOOR OF MY TENT GIVING MYSELF UP TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF THAT CALM AND REPOSE WHICH ARE IMPARTED TO THE SENSES BY SUCH SCENES AS THESE
6531-61334-0044 AS THE SUN WENT DOWN BEHIND THE LOW HILLS WHICH SEPARATE THE RIVER FROM THE DESERT EVEN THEIR ROCKY SIDES HAD STRUGGLED TO EMULATE THE VERDANT CLOTHING OF THE PLAIN ITS RECEDING RAYS WERE GRADUALLY WITHDRAWN
6531-61334-0045 LIKE A TRANSPARENT VEIL OF LIGHT FROM THE LANDSCAPE OVER THE PURE CLOUDLESS SKY WAS THE GLOW OF THE LAST LIGHT
6531-61334-0046 KESHAF ANOTHER VENERABLE RUIN ROSE INDISTINCTLY INTO THE EVENING MIST STILL MORE DISTANT AND STILL MORE INDISTINCT WAS A SOLITARY HILL OVERLOOKING THE ANCIENT CITY OF ARBELA
6531-61334-0047 THE KURDISH MOUNTAINS WHOSE SNOWY SUMMITS CHERISHED THE DYING SUNBEAMS YET STRUGGLED WITH THE TWILIGHT THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND LOWING OF CATTLE
6531-61334-0048 AT FIRST FAINT BECAME LOUDER AS THE FLOCKS RETURNED FROM THEIR PASTURES AND WANDERED AMONGST THE TENTS GIRLS HURRIED OVER THE GREENSWARD TO SEEK THEIR FATHERS CATTLE OR CROUCHED DOWN TO MILK THOSE WHICH HAD RETURNED ALONE TO THEIR WELL REMEMBERED FOLDS
6531-61334-0049 BALES OF EMBROIDERED CLOTH IVORY AND JEWELS SILVER AND GOLD THE PRODUCTS OF MANY COUNTRIES WHILE THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS WERE ASSEMBLED THERE TO REAR STATELY BUILDINGS WHICH ULTIMATELY FELL INTO DECAY AND WERE BURIED BY DRIFTING SANDS
6531-61334-0050 LAYARD EXCAVATED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE AND DISPATCHED TO LONDON AMONG OTHER TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY
6531-61334-0051 THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
6531-61334-0052 THEY REFLECT THE SPIRIT OF ASSYRIA'S GREATNESS WHICH HOWEVER HAD A MATERIALISTIC BASIS ASSYRIAN ART FOUND EXPRESSION IN DELINEATING THE OUTWARD FORM RATHER THAN IN STRIVING TO CREATE A THING OF BEAUTY WHICH IS A JOY FOR EVER
6531-61334-0053 WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL DIED
6531-61334-0054 WHOSE MILITARY ACTIVITIES EXTENDED OVER HIS WHOLE REIGN
6531-61334-0055 AS SHALMANESER WAS THE FIRST ASSYRIAN KING WHO CAME INTO DIRECT TOUCH WITH THE HEBREWS IT WILL BE OF INTEREST HERE TO REVIEW THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDED KINGDOMS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH AS RECORDED IN THE BIBLE
6531-61334-0056 ESTABLISHED THE RELIGION OF THE CANAANITES AND MADE GODS AND MOLTEN IMAGES HE WAS CONDEMNED FOR HIS IDOLATRY BY THE PROPHET AHIJAH WHO DECLARED THE LORD SHALL SMITE ISRAEL AS A REED IS SHAKEN IN THE WATER
6531-61334-0057 AND HE SHALL ROOT UP ISRAEL OUT OF THIS GOOD LAND WHICH HE GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS AND SHALL SCATTER THEM BEYOND THE RIVER
6531-61334-0058 AND HIS PEOPLE SLEW THEM WITH A GREAT SLAUGHTER SO THERE FELL DOWN SLAIN IN ISRAEL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHOSEN MEN THUS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE BROUGHT UNDER AT THAT TIME AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH PREVAILED BECAUSE THEY RELIED UPON THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS
6531-61334-0059 AND ABIJAH PURSUED AFTER JEROBOAM AND TOOK CITIES FROM HIM BETHEL WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF AND JESHANAH WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF
6531-61334-0060 AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID
6531-61334-0061 IN HIS DAYS THE LAND WAS QUIET TEN YEARS
6531-61334-0062 FOR HE TOOK AWAY THE ALTARS OF THE STRANGE GODS AND THE HIGH PLACES AND BRAKE DOWN THE IMAGES AND CUT DOWN THE GROVES AND COMMANDED JUDAH TO SEEK THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND TO DO THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENT
6531-61334-0063 ALSO HE TOOK AWAY OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THE HIGH PLACES AND THE IMAGES
6531-61334-0064 HE PROCEEDED TO FORTIFY RAMAH A FEW MILES TO THE NORTH OF JERUSALEM
6531-61334-0065 AND APPARENTLY SUPPORTED THE REBELLIONS OF THE NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIAN KINGS
6531-61334-0066 AND THEREFORE UNABLE EITHER TO ASSERT ITS AUTHORITY IN JUDAH
6531-61334-0067 IN THE HOUR OF PERIL JUDAH SOUGHT THE AID OF THE KING OF DAMASCUS
6531-61334-0068 AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS
6531-61334-0069 THE SON OF TABRIMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA THAT DWELT AT DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A LEAGUE BETWEEN ME AND THEE AND BETWEEN MY FATHER AND THY FATHER BEHOLD
6531-61334-0070 WHEN HE WAS MURDERED BY HIS SERVANT ZIMRI CAPTAIN OF HALF HIS CHARIOTS WHILE HE WAS DRINKING HIMSELF DRUNK IN THE HOUSE OF ARZA STEWARD OF HIS HOUSE IN TIRZAH
6531-61334-0071 ZIMRI'S REVOLT WAS SHORTLIVED HE REIGNED ONLY SEVEN DAYS IN TIRZAH THE ARMY WAS ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ENCAMPED HEARD SAY
6531-61334-0072 ZIMRI HATH CONSPIRED AND HATH ALSO SLAIN THE KING WHEREFORE ALL ISRAEL MADE OMRI THE CAPTAIN OF THE HOST KING OVER ISRAEL THAT DAY IN THE CAMP AND OMRI WENT UP FROM GIBBETHON AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM
6531-61334-0073 AND AHAB DID EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD ABOVE ALL THAT WERE BEFORE HIM SO NOTORIOUS INDEED WERE FATHER AND SON THAT THE PROPHET MICAH DECLARED TO THE BACKSLIDERS OF HIS DAY FOR THE STATUTES OF OMRI ARE KEPT
6531-61334-0074 AND ALL THE WORKS OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB AND YE WALK IN THEIR COUNSEL
6531-61334-0075 BOAST HIMSELF AS HE THAT PUTTETH IT OFF
6531-61334-0076 TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BROKEN THE POWER OF AKHUNI
6531-61334-0077 THE LEADER OF A STRONG CONFEDERACY OF PETTY STATES THEREAFTER THE ASSYRIAN MONARCH TURNED TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AND ATTACKED THE HITTITE STATE OF HAMATH
6531-61334-0078 THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES ALTHOUGH SHALMANESER CLAIMED A VICTORY ON THIS OCCASION
6531-61334-0079 IT WAS OF NO GREAT ADVANTAGE TO HIM FOR HE WAS UNABLE TO FOLLOW IT UP
6531-61334-0080 OF DAMASCUS AND AHAB OF ISRAEL AKHABBU
6531-61334-0081 THE LATTER HAD A FORCE OF TEN THOUSAND MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND FOUR YEARS AFTER AHAB BEGAN TO REIGN
6531-61334-0082 HE TURNED NOT ASIDE FROM IT DOING THAT WHICH WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD NEVERTHELESS THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY
6531-61334-0083 DURING THIS PERIOD BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE TWO KINGDOMS HAD BEEN DRAWN TOGETHER
6531-61334-0084 AFTER REPULSING THE SYRIAN ALLIES AT QARQAR
6531-61334-0085 SHALMANESER THE THIRD OF ASSYRIA FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INVADE BABYLONIA
6531-61334-0086 OF THAT KINGDOM AND WAS THUS ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH WEST WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPLICATIONS WITH THE RIVAL CLAIMANT OF MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0087 WERE RIVALS FOR THE THRONE THE FORMER THE RIGHTFUL HEIR APPEALED FOR HELP TO SHALMANESER AND THAT MONARCH AT ONCE HASTENED TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY IN THE SOUTHERN KINGDOM
6531-61334-0088 WAS SUPPORTED BY AN ARAMAEAN ARMY WAS DEFEATED AND PUT TO DEATH
6531-61334-0089 AFTERWARDS REIGNED OVER BABYLONIA AS THE VASSAL OF ASSYRIA AND SHALMANESER HIS OVERLORD MADE OFFERINGS TO THE GODS AT BABYLON BORSIPPA AND CUTHAH
6531-61334-0090 AND COMPELLED TO PAY ANNUAL TRIBUTE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHALMANESER HAD TO LEAD AN EXPEDITION INTO NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND SUPPRESS A FRESH REVOLT IN THAT TROUBLED REGION BUT THE WESTERN ALLIES SOON GATHERED STRENGTH AGAIN
6531-61334-0091 HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RETURN WITH A GREAT ARMY BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING ANY PERMANENT SUCCESS ALTHOUGH HE PUT HIS ENEMIES TO FLIGHT THE VARIOUS WESTERN KINGDOMS INCLUDING DAMASCUS ISRAEL
6531-61334-0092 REMAINED UNCONQUERED AND CONTINUED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM THE RESISTING POWER OF THE SYRIAN ALLIES HOWEVER WAS BEING GREATLY WEAKENED BY INTERNAL REVOLTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN STIRRED UP BY ASSYRIAN EMISSARIES
6531-61334-0093 A ROYAL PRINCESS OF ISRAEL WAS DEAD
6531-61334-0094 THUS SAITH THE LORD I HAVE ANOINTED THEE KING OVER ISRAEL AND THOU SHALT SMITE THE HOUSE OF AHAB THY MASTER THAT I MAY AVENGE THE BLOOD OF MY SERVANTS THE PROPHETS AND THE BLOOD OF ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE LORD
6531-61334-0095 JEHU CONSPIRED AGAINST JORAM AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN ESCORT
6531-61334-0096 SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THE REVOLT TO THE KING WHOM HE WAS TO DEPOSE THE WATCHMAN ON THE TOWER OF JEZREEL SAW JEHU AND HIS COMPANY APPROACHING
6531-61334-0097 AND INFORMED JORAM WHO TWICE SENT OUT A MESSENGER TO ENQUIRE IS IT PEACE NEITHER MESSENGER RETURNED AND THE WATCHMAN INFORMED THE WOUNDED MONARCH OF ISRAEL HE CAME EVEN UNTO THEM AND COMETH NOT AGAIN
6531-61334-0098 AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
6531-61334-0099 WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED HE MADE OFFERINGS THERE TO HADAD THE LOCAL THOR AND THEN SUDDENLY MARCHED SOUTHWARD HAZAEL WENT OUT TO OPPOSE THE ADVANCING ASSYRIANS AND CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THEM IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNT HERMON
6531-61334-0100 I FOUGHT WITH HIM SHALMANESER RECORDED AND ACCOMPLISHED HIS DEFEAT
6531-61334-0101 HE FLED TO SAVE HIS LIFE HAZAEL TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE WALLS OF DAMASCUS WHICH THE ASSYRIANS BESIEGED BUT FAILED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE SHALMANESER'S SOLDIERS MEANWHILE WASTED AND BURNED CITIES WITHOUT NUMBER
6531-61334-0102 AND CARRIED AWAY GREAT BOOTY IN THOSE DAYS SHALMANESER RECORDED I RECEIVED TRIBUTE FROM THE TYRIANS AND SIDONIANS AND FROM YAUA JEHU
6531-61334-0103 SHOWS THAT THE UNPRONOUNCED ALEPH AT THE END WAS AT THAT TIME SOUNDED
6531-61334-0104 JEHUA SHALMANESER DID NOT AGAIN ATTACK DAMASCUS HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE WAS THEREFORE CONFINED TO NORTH SYRIA
6531-61334-0105 HIS REVOLT RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF THE ORTHODOX HEBREWS AND HE BEGAN WELL BY INAUGURATING REFORMS IN THE NORTHERN KINGDOM WITH PURPOSE APPARENTLY TO RE ESTABLISH THE WORSHIP OF DAVID'S GOD HE PERSECUTED THE PROPHETS OF BAAL BUT SOON BECAME A BACKSLIDER
6531-61334-0106 FOR ALTHOUGH HE STAMPED OUT THE PHOENICIAN RELIGION HE BEGAN TO WORSHIP THE GOLDEN CALVES THAT WERE IN BETHEL AND THAT WERE IN DAN
6531-61334-0107 OF THE IDOLATORS OF THE ANCIENT CULT OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN THE CROWN OF JUDAH HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE ISRAELITISH QUEEN MOTHER
6531-61334-0108 BUT ANOTHER WOMAN THWARTED THE COMPLETION OF HER MONSTROUS DESIGN
6531-61334-0109 THE KING'S SON AND PUT UPON HIM THE CROWN AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY AND MADE HIM KING AND JEHOIADA AND HIS SONS ANOINTED HIM AND SAID GOD SAVE THE KING
6531-61334-0110 SHE CAME TO THE PEOPLE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SHE LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE KING STOOD AT HIS PILLAR AT THE ENTERING IN AND THE PRINCES AND THE TRUMPETS BY THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICED AND SOUNDED WITH TRUMPETS
6531-61334-0111 ALSO THE SINGERS WITH INSTRUMENTS OF MUSICK AND SUCH AS TAUGHT TO SING PRAISE
6531-61334-0112 AND SAID TREASON TREASON THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BROUGHT OUT THE CAPTAINS OF HUNDREDS THAT WERE SET OVER THE HOST
6531-61334-0113 HAVE HER FORTH OF THE RANGES AND WHOSO FOLLOWETH HER LET HIM BE SLAIN BY THE SWORD FOR THE PRIEST SAID SLAY HER NOT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO THEY LAID HANDS ON HER
6531-61334-0114 AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
6531-61334-0115 AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF BEN HADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL ALL THEIR DAYS THEN JEHOAHAZ REPENTED HE BESOUGHT THE LORD AND THE LORD HEARKENED UNTO HIM FOR HE SAW THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL
6531-61334-0116 AND KEPT HIS GENERALS CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED SUPPRESSING REVOLTS ON HIS FRONTIERS AFTER HE SUBDUED THE HITTITES
6531-61334-0117 TRIBES OF THE MEDES CAME UNDER HIS POWER
6531-61334-0118 LIKE THE FRONTIER TRIBES OF INDIA AGAINST THE BRITISH TROOPS THE KINGDOM OF URARTU WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE POWERFUL
6531-61334-0119 THE GREAT EMPIRE WAS SUDDENLY SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS BY THE OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR THE PARTY OF REBELLION WAS LED BY SHALMANESER'S SON ASHUR DANIN APLI
6531-61334-0120 HE WAS A POPULAR HERO AND RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ASSYRIAN CITIES INCLUDING NINEVEH
6531-61334-0121 ARBELA IMGURBEL AND DUR BALAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE DEPENDENCIES SHALMANESER RETAINED KALKHI AND THE PROVINCES OF NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND IT APPEARS THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE ARMY ALSO REMAINED LOYAL TO HIM
6531-61334-0122 AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR SHALMANESER DIED HIS CHOSEN HEIR
6531-61334-0123 WHEN AT LENGTH THE NEW KING HAD STAMPED OUT THE LAST EMBERS OF REVOLT WITHIN THE KINGDOM HE HAD TO UNDERTAKE THE RECONQUEST OF THOSE PROVINCES WHICH IN THE INTERVAL
6531-61334-0124 URARTU IN THE NORTH HAD GROWN MORE AGGRESSIVE THE SYRIANS WERE OPENLY DEFIANT THE MEDES WERE CONDUCTING BOLD RAIDS
6531-61334-0125 SHAMSHI ADAD HOWEVER
6531-61334-0126 BURNED MANY CITIES AND COLLECTED ENORMOUS TRIBUTE WHILE THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS WERE TAKEN AND FORCED TO SERVE THE CONQUEROR HAVING ESTABLISHED HIS POWER IN THE NORTH SHAMSHI ADAD
6531-61334-0127 ON HIS WAY SOUTHWARD HE SUBDUED MANY VILLAGES
6531-61334-0128 AND ACHIEVED A GREAT VICTORY KILLING THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND TAKING THREE THOUSAND CAPTIVES THEN THE BABYLONIAN KING
6531-61334-0129 BUT WAS DEFEATED IN A FIERCE BATTLE ON THE BANKS OF THE DABAN CANAL
6531-61334-0130 TWO HUNDRED HORSEMEN AND ONE HUNDRED CHARIOTS SHAMSHI ADAD CONDUCTED IN ALL FIVE CAMPAIGNS IN BABYLONIA AND CHALDAEA WHICH HE COMPLETELY SUBDUED PENETRATING AS FAR AS THE SHORES OF THE PERSIAN GULF
6531-61334-0131 IN THE END HE TOOK PRISONER THE NEW KING
6531-61334-0132 FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY AFTER THIS DISASTER BABYLONIA WAS A PROVINCE OF ASSYRIA
8108-280359-0000 FOR THE FUTURE HE MUST BEND ALL HIS CUNNING AND VIGILANCE TO THE TASK OF HIDING HIMSELF FROM THE GAZE OF THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO INJURED AND ESCAPING THE JUST PUNISHMENT HE HAD BROUGHT UPON HIMSELF
8108-280359-0001 THE WORLD IS LARGE AND I AM VERY CLEVER SAID LOKI TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ASGARD AND WANDERED OUT INTO MANHEIM
8108-280359-0002 AND NO MEASURE FOR THE DEEP WATERS NEITHER IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF COUNTING THE VARIOUS FORMS UNDER WHICH I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF ODIN WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND ME
8108-280359-0003 I HAVE NO CAUSE TO FEAR BUT THOUGH LOKI REPEATED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HIMSELF HE WAS AFRAID HE WANDERED FAR INTO THE THICK WOODS AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH THE DEEP WATERS
8108-280359-0004 HE CLIMBED TO THE TOPS OF MISTY HILLS AND CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF HOLLOW CAVES BUT ABOVE THE WOOD AND THROUGH THE WATER AND DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS A SINGLE RAY OF CALM CLEAR LIGHT SEEMED ALWAYS TO FOLLOW HIM
8108-280359-0005 AND HE KNEW THAT IT CAME FROM THE EYE OF ODIN WHO WAS WATCHING HIM FROM AIR THRONE THEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE THE WATCHFUL EYE BY DISGUISING HIMSELF UNDER VARIOUS SHAPES SOMETIMES HE WAS AN EAGLE ON A LONELY MOUNTAIN CRAG
8108-280359-0006 SOMETIMES HE HID HIMSELF AS ONE AMONG A TROOP OF TIMID REINDEER SOMETIMES HE LAY IN THE NEST OF A WOOD PIGEON SOMETIMES HE SWAM A BRIGHT SPOTTED FISH IN THE SEA BUT WHEREVER HE WAS AMONG LIVING CREATURES
8108-280359-0007 OR ALONE WITH DEAD NATURE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO KNOW HIM AND TO FIND A VOICE IN WHICH TO SAY TO HIM
8108-280359-0008 AIR EARTH OR WATER THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIM ANYWHERE TIRED AT LAST OF SEEKING WHAT HE COULD NOWHERE FIND LOKI BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE NEAR A NARROW GLITTERING RIVER WHICH LOWER DOWN FLASHED FROM A HIGH ROCK INTO THE SEA BELOW
8108-280359-0009 HE TOOK CARE THAT HIS HOUSE SHOULD HAVE FOUR DOORS IN IT THAT HE MIGHT LOOK OUT ON EVERY SIDE AND CATCH THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GODS WHEN THEY CAME AS HE KNEW THEY WOULD COME TO TAKE HIM AWAY HERE HIS WIFE SIGUNA AND HIS TWO SONS
8108-280359-0010 ALI AND NARI CAME TO LIVE WITH HIM SIGUNA WAS A KIND WOMAN FAR TOO GOOD AND KIND FOR LOKI SHE FELT SORRY FOR HIM NOW THAT SHE SAW HE WAS IN GREAT FEAR AND THAT EVERY LIVING THING HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM
8108-280359-0011 AND SHE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN HIM FROM THE JUST ANGER OF THE GODS IF SHE COULD BUT THE TWO SONS CARED LITTLE ABOUT THEIR FATHER'S DREAD AND DANGER THEY SPENT ALL THEIR TIME IN QUARRELING WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR LOUD ANGRY VOICES SOUNDING ABOVE THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0012 WOULD SPEEDILY HAVE BETRAYED THE HIDING PLACE EVEN IF ODIN'S PIERCING EYE HAD NOT ALREADY FOUND IT OUT AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HOUSE LOOKING ALTERNATELY OUT OF ALL THE FOUR DOORS AND AMUSING HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD
8108-280359-0013 BY MAKING A FISHING NET HE SPIED IN THE DISTANCE THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THE GODS APPROACHING HIS HOUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM COMING ALL TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE AND FREE PIERCED LOKI WITH A PANG THAT WAS WORSE THAN DEATH
8108-280359-0014 HE ROSE WITHOUT DARING TO LOOK AGAIN THREW HIS NET ON A FIRE THAT BURNED ON THE FLOOR AND RUSHING TO THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE RIVER HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO A SALMON SWAM DOWN TO THE DEEPEST STILLEST POOL AT THE BOTTOM
8108-280359-0015 AND HID HIMSELF BETWEEN TWO STONES THE GODS ENTERED THE HOUSE AND LOOKED ALL ROUND IN VAIN FOR LOKI
8108-280359-0016 FAMOUS FOR HIS KEEN SIGHT SPIED OUT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHING NET IN THE FIRE THEN ODIN KNEW AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS A RIVER NEAR AND THAT IT WAS THERE WHERE LOKI HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF HE ORDERED HIS SONS TO MAKE A NEW NET AND TO CAST IT INTO THE WATER
8108-280359-0017 AND DRAG OUT WHATEVER LIVING THING THEY COULD FIND THERE IT WAS DONE AS HE DESIRED THOR HELD ONE END OF THE NET AND ALL THE REST OF THE GODS DREW THE OTHER THROUGH THE WATER WHEN THEY PULLED IT UP THE FIRST TIME HOWEVER IT WAS EMPTY AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY DISAPPOINTED
8108-280359-0018 SAW THAT SOMETHING LIVING HAD CERTAINLY TOUCHED THEM THEY THEN ADDED A WEIGHT TO THE NET AND THREW IT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER AND DRAGGED UP THE STONES IN THE POOL LOKI NOW SAW THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE NET AND
8108-280359-0019 BUT NOT SO QUICKLY BUT THAT THE GODS SAW HIM KNEW HIM THROUGH HIS DISGUISE AND RESOLVED THAT HE SHOULD NO LONGER ESCAPE THEY THEMSELVES DIVIDED INTO TWO BANDS THOR WADED DOWN THE RIVER TO THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0020 THE OTHER GODS STOOD IN A GROUP BELOW LOKI SWAM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THEM FIRST HE THOUGHT HE WOULD DART OUT INTO THE SEA AND THEN THAT HE WOULD SPRING OVER THE NET BACK AGAIN INTO THE RIVER THIS LAST SEEMED THE EASIEST WAY OF ESCAPE
8108-280359-0021 AND WITH THE GREATEST SPEED HE ATTEMPTED IT THOR HOWEVER WAS WATCHING FOR HIM AND AS SOON AS LOKI LEAPED OUT OF THE WATER HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND CAUGHT HIM WHILE HE WAS YET TURNING IN THE AIR
8108-280359-0022 LOKI WRIGGLED HIS SLIPPERY SLIMY LENGTH THROUGH THOR'S FINGERS BUT THE THUNDERER GRASPED HIM TIGHTLY BY THE TAIL AND HOLDING HIM IN THIS MANNER IN THIS HAND WADED TO THE SHORE THERE FATHER ODIN AND THE OTHER GODS MET HIM AND
8108-280359-0023 AT ODIN'S FIRST SEARCHING LOOK LOKI WAS OBLIGED TO DROP HIS DISGUISE AND COWERING AND FRIGHTENED TO ASSUME HIS PROPER SHAPE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED LORDS ONE BY ONE THEY TURNED THEIR FACES FROM HIM FOR IN LOOKING AT HIM
8108-280359-0024 THEY SEEMED TO SEE OVER AGAIN THE DEATH OF BALDUR THE BELOVED YOU WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE HIGH ROCKS LOOKING OVER THE SEA NEAR LOKI'S HOUSE ONE OF THESE HIGHER THAN THE REST HAD MIDWAY FOUR PROJECTING STONES AND TO THESE THE GODS RESOLVED TO BIND LOKI
8108-280359-0025 BE ABLE TO TORMENT THE INHABITANTS OF MANHEIM OR ASGARD BY HIS EVIL DOINGS THOR PROPOSED TO RETURN TO ASGARD TO BRING A CHAIN WITH WHICH TO BIND THE PRISONER BUT ODIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO TAKE SUCH A JOURNEY
8108-280359-0026 LOKI HE SAID HAS ALREADY FORGED FOR HIMSELF A CHAIN STRONGER THAN ANY YOU CAN MAKE WHILE WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN CATCHING HIM HIS TWO SONS ALI AND NARI TRANSFORMED INTO WOLVES
8108-280359-0027 BY THEIR EVIL PASSIONS HAVE FOUGHT WITH AND DESTROYED EACH OTHER WITH THEIR SINEWS WE MUST MAKE A CHAIN TO BIND THEIR FATHER AND FROM THAT HE CAN NEVER ESCAPE IT WAS DONE AS ASA ODIN SAID
8108-280359-0028 A ROPE WAS MADE OF THE DEAD WOLVES SINEWS AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHED LOKI'S BODY IT TURNED INTO BANDS OF IRON
8108-280354-0000 JASON HAD PERSUADED ORPHEUS TO ACCOMPANY THE ARGONAUTS WHEN THEY WENT TO FETCH BACK THE GOLDEN FLEECE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PERILS OF THE WAY WOULD BE LIGHTENED BY SONG TO THE SOUND OF HIS LYRE THE ARGO HAD FLOATED DOWN TO THE SEA
8108-280354-0001 AND HE PLAYED SO SWEETLY WHEN THEY PASSED THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS THAT THE DREADFUL MONSTERS SANG THEIR MOST ALLURING STRAINS IN VAIN
8108-280354-0002 WHOM HE LOVED DEARLY AND WHO RETURNED HIS LOVE BUT AT THEIR MARRIAGE THE OMENS WERE NOT FAVORABLE HYMEN THE MARRIAGE GOD CAME TO IT WITH A GLOOMY COUNTENANCE AND THE WEDDING TORCHES SMOKED
8108-280354-0003 AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
8108-280354-0004 WAS TO BE BUT SHORT LIVED FOR AS THE NEW MADE BRIDE WANDERED THROUGH THE WOODS WITH THE OTHER NYMPHS A POISONOUS SERPENT STUNG HER HEEL AND NO REMEDY AVAILED TO SAVE HER ORPHEUS WAS THROWN
8108-280354-0005 INTO MOST PASSIONATE GRIEF AT HIS WIFE'S DEATH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD LOST HER FOR EVER BUT PRAYED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT CEASING TO THE GODS ABOVE TO RESTORE HER TO HIM WHEN THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN
8108-280354-0006 HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO WIN HER BACK HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LOWER WORLD AND SEEK HER AMONG THE DEAD AND TRY WHETHER ANY PRAYER OR PERSUASION COULD MOVE PLUTO TO RESTORE HIS BELOVED NEAR TAENARUM
8108-280354-0007 IN LACONIA WAS A CAVE AMONG DARK AND GLOOMY ROCKS THROUGH WHICH LED ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE LOWER WORLD THIS WAS THE ROAD BY WHICH HERCULES DESCENDED WHEN HE WENT TO CARRY OFF CERBERUS
8108-280354-0008 THE THREE HEADED DOG THAT GUARDS THE THRESHOLD OF PLUTO UNDAUNTED BY THE TERRORS OF THE PLACE ORPHEUS PASSED THROUGH THIS GATE AND DOWN A DARK AND DISMAL ROAD TO THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD
8108-280354-0009 HERE HE CAME IN SAFETY THROUGH THE CROWD OF GHOSTS AND PHANTOMS AND STOOD AT LAST BEFORE THE THRONE OF PLUTO AND PROSERPINA THEN HE TOUCHED THE CHORDS OF HIS LYRE AND CHANTED THESE WORDS
8108-280354-0010 GREAT LORDS OF THE WORLD BELOW THE EARTH TO WHICH ALL WE MORTALS MUST ONE DAY COME GRANT ME TO TELL A SIMPLE TALE
8108-280354-0011 THE LIFELESS GHOSTS CAME FLOCKING AND AS THEY HEARD THEY WEPT TANTALUS FORGOT HIS HUNGER AND THIRST
8108-280354-0012 SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
8108-280354-0013 AND SHE CAME YET HALTING FROM HER RECENT WOUND TAKE HER SAYS PLUTO AND LEAD HER BACK TO THE LIGHT
8108-280354-0014 NOR MUST YOU ONCE TURN ROUND TO LOOK UPON HER
8108-280354-0015 ELSE THE BOON WE GRANT YOU WILL BE BUT VAIN A STEEP PATH LED UPWARD FROM THE REALM OF DARKNESS AND THE WAY WAS HARD TO FIND THROUGH THE GLOOM IN SILENCE ORPHEUS LED ON TILL THE GOAL WAS CLOSE AT HAND
8108-280354-0016 AND THE WELCOMING LIGHT OF THE UPPER AIR BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE DARKNESS THEN A SUDDEN FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART
8108-280354-0017 HE TURNED TO GAZE ON HIS BELOVED DIMLY HE SAW HER BUT FOR THE LAST TIME FOR A POWER SHE COULD NOT RESIST DREW HER BACK ORPHEUS STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS AND TRIED TO SEIZE HER BUT HE ONLY CLASPED THE EMPTY AIR
8108-280354-0018 HE SAT ON THE FURTHER BANK WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK
8108-280354-0019 THEN AT LAST HE KNEW THAT THE GODS BELOW WERE PITILESS AND FULL OF SORROW HE RETURNED TO THE UPPER EARTH FOR THREE YEARS
8108-280354-0020 FINDING HIS ONLY CONSOLATION IN THE MUSIC OF HIS LYRE FOR HE SHUNNED ALL MEN AND WOMEN
8108-280354-0021 ONE DAY HE SAT DOWN TO REST ON A GRASSY HILL IN THE SUNSHINE AND PLAYED AND SANG TO BEGUILE HIS SORROW AS HE PLAYED THE COOLNESS OF SHADY BRANCHES SEEMED ALL ABOUT HIM AND LOOKING UP HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A WOOD
8108-280354-0022 OAK POPLAR LIME BEECH LAUREL ASH PINE PLANE AND MAPLE AND MANY ANOTHER TREE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER HERE DRAWN FROM THEIR DISTANT FOREST HOMES BY THE SOUNDS OF ORPHEUS'S LYRE
8108-280354-0023 YES AND THE BEASTS AND THE BIRDS OF THE FIELD CAME TOO AND ORPHEUS SAT IN THEIR MIDST AND SANG AND PLAYED THE TUNES OF SORROW SUDDENLY A GREAT NOISE WAS HEARD OF LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING AND MERRY MAKING
8108-280354-0024 FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEASTS OF BACCHUS AND THE WOMEN WERE CELEBRATING HIS RITES WANDERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH DANCE AND REVEL WHEN THEY SAW ORPHEUS THEY SET UP A SHOUT OF DERISION SEE THEY CRIED
8108-280354-0025 THE WRETCHED SINGER WHO MOCKS AT WOMEN AND WILL HAVE NO BRIDE BUT THE DEAD COME LET US KILL HIM AND SHOW THAT NO MAN SHALL DESPISE US UNPUNISHED WITH THESE WORDS THEY BEGAN TO THROW WANDS AND STONES AT HIM
8108-280354-0026 AND FELL HARMLESSLY TO THE GROUND THEN THE WOMEN RAISED A WILD SHOUT AND MADE SUCH A CLAMOR WITH TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS THAT THE SOFT TONES OF THE HARP WERE DROWNED BY THE NOISE NOW AT LAST THE SHOTS TOOK EFFECT
8108-280354-0027 AND IN THEIR FURY THE WOMEN FELL UPON HIM DEALING BLOW ON BLOW ORPHEUS FELL LIFELESS TO THE GROUND BUT HE WAS NOT TO DIE UNWEPT THE LITTLE BIRDS OF THE FOREST MOURNED FOR HIM EVEN THE STONY ROCKS WEPT
8108-280354-0028 THE TREES SHED THEIR LEAVES WITH GRIEF AND THE DRYADS AND NAIADS TORE THEIR HAIR AND PUT ON THE GARB OF SORROW ONLY THE PITILESS REVELERS KNEW NO REMORSE THEY SEIZED THE SINGER'S HEAD
8108-280354-0029 AND THREW IT WITH HIS LYRE INTO THE RIVER HEBRUS THERE IT FLOATED DOWN STREAM AND STRANGE TO TELL THE CHORDS GAVE FORTH A LAMENT AND THE LIFELESS TONGUE UTTERED WORDS
8108-280354-0030 IT CRIED TILL HEAD AND LYRE WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE SEA AND ON TO LESBOS THE ISLE OF SWEET SONG WHERE IN AFTER YEARS
8108-280354-0031 AND SAPPHO TUNED AFRESH THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS
2989-138035-0000 IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS DON QUIXOTE HAD GONE BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND DON DIEGO'S VILLAGE WHEN HE FELL IN WITH A COUPLE OF EITHER PRIESTS OR STUDENTS AND A COUPLE OF PEASANTS
2989-138035-0001 AND BOTH STUDENTS AND PEASANTS WERE STRUCK WITH THE SAME AMAZEMENT THAT EVERYBODY FELT WHO SAW DON QUIXOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WERE DYING TO KNOW WHO THIS MAN SO DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY MEN COULD BE DON QUIXOTE SALUTED THEM AND AFTER ASCERTAINING THAT THEIR ROAD WAS THE SAME AS HIS
2989-138035-0002 MADE THEM AN OFFER OF HIS COMPANY AND BEGGED THEM TO SLACKEN THEIR PACE AS THEIR YOUNG ASSES TRAVELLED FASTER THAN HIS HORSE AND THEN TO GRATIFY THEM HE TOLD THEM IN A FEW WORDS WHO HE WAS AND THE CALLING AND PROFESSION HE FOLLOWED
2989-138035-0003 WHICH WAS THAT OF A KNIGHT ERRANT SEEKING ADVENTURES IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD HE INFORMED THEM THAT HIS OWN NAME WAS DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THAT HE WAS CALLED BY WAY OF SURNAME THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS ALL THIS WAS GREEK OR GIBBERISH TO THE PEASANTS
2989-138035-0004 FOR ALL THAT HOWEVER THEY REGARDED HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND RESPECT AND ONE OF THEM SAID TO HIM IF YOU SIR KNIGHT HAVE NO FIXED ROAD AS IT IS THE WAY WITH THOSE WHO SEEK ADVENTURES NOT TO HAVE ANY LET YOUR WORSHIP COME WITH US
2989-138035-0005 WHO IS CALLED PAR EXCELLENCE
2989-138035-0006 AS THE BRIDEGROOM IS CALLED CAMACHO THE RICH SHE IS EIGHTEEN AND HE TWENTY TWO AND THEY ARE FAIRLY MATCHED THOUGH SOME KNOWING ONES WHO HAVE ALL THE PEDIGREES IN THE WORLD BY HEART WILL HAVE IT THAT THE FAMILY OF THE FAIR QUITERIA IS BETTER THAN CAMACHO'S
2989-138035-0007 BUT NO ONE MINDS THAT NOW A DAYS FOR WEALTH CAN SOLDER A GREAT MANY FLAWS AT ANY RATE CAMACHO IS FREE HANDED
2989-138035-0008 HE HAS PROVIDED DANCERS TOO NOT ONLY SWORD BUT ALSO BELL DANCERS FOR IN HIS OWN TOWN THERE ARE THOSE WHO RING THE CHANGES AND JINGLE THE BELLS TO PERFECTION OF SHOE DANCERS I SAY NOTHING FOR OF THEM HE HAS ENGAGED A HOST BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS
2989-138035-0009 NOR OF THE MANY OTHERS I HAVE OMITTED TO MENTION

2989-138035-0011 SO THAT THE LOVES OF THE TWO CHILDREN BASILIO AND QUITERIA
2989-138035-0012 HE ARRANGED A MATCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RICH CAMACHO
2989-138035-0013 WHO HAD NOT SO LARGE A SHARE OF THE GIFTS OF FORTUNE AS OF NATURE FOR IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD UNGRUDGINGLY HE IS THE MOST AGILE YOUTH WE KNOW A MIGHTY THROWER OF THE BAR A FIRST RATE WRESTLER AND A GREAT BALL PLAYER HE RUNS LIKE A DEER AND LEAPS BETTER THAN A GOAT
2989-138035-0014 BOWLS OVER THE NINE PINS AS IF BY MAGIC
2989-138035-0015 AND ABOVE ALL HANDLES A SWORD AS WELL AS THE BEST
2989-138035-0016 SAY THAT TO MY WIFE SAID SANCHO WHO HAD UNTIL NOW LISTENED IN SILENCE FOR SHE WON'T HEAR OF ANYTHING BUT EACH ONE MARRYING HIS EQUAL HOLDING WITH THE PROVERB EACH EWE TO HER LIKE
2989-138035-0017 IF ALL THOSE WHO LOVE ONE ANOTHER WERE TO MARRY SAID DON QUIXOTE IT WOULD DEPRIVE PARENTS OF THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND MARRY THEIR CHILDREN TO THE PROPER PERSON AND AT THE PROPER TIME AND IF IT WAS LEFT TO DAUGHTERS TO CHOOSE HUSBANDS AS THEY PLEASED
2989-138035-0018 ONE WOULD BE FOR CHOOSING HER FATHER'S SERVANT AND ANOTHER SOME ONE SHE HAS SEEN PASSING IN THE STREET AND FANCIES GALLANT AND DASHING THOUGH HE MAY BE A DRUNKEN BULLY
2989-138035-0019 AND THE MATRIMONIAL CHOICE IS VERY LIABLE TO ERROR
2989-138035-0020 WHY THEN SHOULD NOT HE DO THE SAME WHO HAS TO MAKE THE WHOLE JOURNEY OF LIFE DOWN TO THE FINAL HALTING PLACE OF DEATH MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPANION HAS TO BE HIS COMPANION IN BED AT BOARD AND EVERYWHERE AS THE WIFE IS TO HER HUSBAND
2989-138035-0021 HE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN TO SMILE OR HEARD TO UTTER RATIONAL WORD AND HE ALWAYS GOES ABOUT MOODY AND DEJECTED TALKING TO HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT SHOWS PLAINLY HE IS OUT OF HIS SENSES HE EATS LITTLE AND SLEEPS LITTLE AND ALL HE EATS IS FRUIT AND WHEN HE SLEEPS
2989-138035-0022 IF HE SLEEPS AT ALL IT IS IN THE FIELD ON THE HARD EARTH LIKE A BRUTE BEAST SOMETIMES HE GAZES AT THE SKY
2989-138035-0023 THAT HE MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR A CLOTHED STATUE WITH ITS DRAPERY STIRRED BY THE WIND IN SHORT HE SHOWS SUCH SIGNS OF A HEART CRUSHED BY SUFFERING THAT ALL WE WHO KNOW HIM
2989-138035-0024 AND ANY ONE OF THEM OR ANY MOMENT THE HOUSE MAY FALL I HAVE SEEN THE RAIN COMING DOWN AND THE SUN SHINING ALL AT ONE TIME
2989-138035-0025 AND TELL ME IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN BOAST OF HAVING DRIVEN A NAIL INTO THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE NO FAITH AND BETWEEN A WOMAN'S YES AND NO I WOULDN'T VENTURE TO PUT THE POINT OF A PIN
2989-138035-0026 FOR LOVE I HAVE HEARD SAY
2989-138035-0027 POVERTY WEALTH AND BLEAR EYES PEARLS WHAT ART THOU DRIVING AT SANCHO CURSES ON THEE SAID DON QUIXOTE
2989-138035-0028 NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THEE BUT JUDAS HIMSELF AND I WISH HE HAD THEE TELL ME THOU ANIMAL WHAT DOST THOU KNOW ABOUT NAILS OR WHEELS OR ANYTHING ELSE OH IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED SANCHO IT IS NO WONDER MY WORDS ARE TAKEN FOR NONSENSE
2989-138035-0029 BUT NO MATTER I UNDERSTAND MYSELF AND I KNOW I HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING VERY FOOLISH IN WHAT I HAVE SAID ONLY YOUR WORSHIP SENOR IS ALWAYS GRAVELLING AT EVERYTHING I SAY NAY EVERYTHING I DO
2989-138035-0030 MAYBE THERE ARE TOLEDANS WHO DO NOT HIT IT OFF WHEN IT COMES TO POLISHED TALK THAT IS TRUE SAID THE LICENTIATE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BRED UP IN THE TANNERIES
2989-138035-0031 AND YET THEY ARE ALL TOLEDANS PURE CORRECT
2989-138035-0032 THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MAJALAHONDA I SAY OF DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE NOT SO AND DISCRIMINATION IS THE GRAMMAR OF GOOD LANGUAGE IF IT BE ACCOMPANIED BY PRACTICE I SIRS FOR MY SINS HAVE STUDIED CANON LAW AT SALAMANCA
2989-138035-0033 WHERE YOU ARE NOW TAIL LOOK HERE BACHELOR CORCHUELO RETURNED THE LICENTIATE YOU HAVE THE MOST MISTAKEN IDEA IN THE WORLD ABOUT SKILL WITH THE SWORD IF YOU THINK IT USELESS IT IS NO IDEA ON MY PART BUT AN ESTABLISHED TRUTH
2989-138035-0034 AND THESE JOINED WITH MY RESOLUTION WHICH IS NOT SMALL WILL MAKE YOU CONFESS THAT I AM NOT MISTAKEN DISMOUNT AND PUT IN PRACTICE YOUR POSITIONS AND CIRCLES AND ANGLES AND SCIENCE FOR I HOPE TO MAKE YOU SEE STARS AT NOONDAY WITH MY RUDE RAW SWORDSMANSHIP
2989-138035-0035 WHO WILL MAKE ME TURN MY BACK AND THAT THERE IS NOT ONE IN THE WORLD I WILL NOT COMPEL TO GIVE GROUND AS TO WHETHER YOU TURN YOUR BACK OR NOT I DO NOT CONCERN MYSELF REPLIED THE MASTER OF FENCE
2989-138035-0036 THOUGH IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR GRAVE WOULD BE DUG ON THE SPOT WHERE YOU PLANTED YOUR FOOT THE FIRST TIME I MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE STRETCHED DEAD THERE FOR DESPISING SKILL WITH THE SWORD
2989-138035-0037 BUT HE WAS MET BY A TAP ON THE MOUTH FROM THE BUTTON OF THE LICENTIATE'S SWORD THAT CHECKED HIM IN THE MIDST OF HIS FURIOUS ONSET AND MADE HIM KISS IT AS IF IT WERE A RELIC THOUGH NOT AS DEVOUTLY AS RELICS ARE AND OUGHT TO BE KISSED
2989-138035-0038 THE END OF IT WAS THAT THE LICENTIATE RECKONED UP FOR HIM BY THRUSTS EVERY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF THE SHORT CASSOCK HE WORE TORE THE SKIRTS INTO STRIPS LIKE THE TAILS OF A CUTTLEFISH KNOCKED OFF HIS HAT TWICE AND SO COMPLETELY TIRED HIM OUT
2989-138035-0039 THAT IN VEXATION ANGER AND RAGE HE TOOK THE SWORD BY THE HILT AND FLUNG IT AWAY WITH SUCH FORCE THAT ONE OF THE PEASANTS THAT WERE THERE WHO WAS A NOTARY AND WHO WENT FOR IT MADE AN AFFIDAVIT AFTERWARDS THAT HE SENT IT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF A LEAGUE
2989-138035-0040 BY MY FAITH SENOR BACHELOR IF YOUR WORSHIP TAKES MY ADVICE YOU WILL NEVER CHALLENGE ANYONE TO FENCE AGAIN ONLY TO WRESTLE AND THROW THE BAR FOR YOU HAVE THE YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR THAT BUT AS FOR THESE FENCERS AS THEY CALL THEM I HAVE HEARD SAY
2989-138035-0041 THEY CAN PUT THE POINT OF A SWORD THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE I AM SATISFIED WITH HAVING TUMBLED OFF MY DONKEY SAID CORCHUELO AND WITH HAVING HAD THE TRUTH I WAS SO IGNORANT OF PROVED TO ME BY EXPERIENCE AND GETTING UP HE EMBRACED THE LICENTIATE
2989-138035-0042 AND THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN EVER AND NOT CARING TO WAIT FOR THE NOTARY WHO HAD GONE FOR THE SWORD
2989-138035-0043 THEY RESOLVED TO PUSH ON SO AS TO REACH THE VILLAGE OF QUITERIA TO WHICH THEY ALL BELONGED IN GOOD TIME DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE JOURNEY THE LICENTIATE HELD FORTH TO THEM ON THE EXCELLENCES OF THE SWORD WITH SUCH CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENTS AND SUCH FIGURES AND MATHEMATICAL PROOFS
2989-138035-0044 IT GREW DARK BUT BEFORE THEY REACHED THE TOWN IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL AS IF THERE WAS A HEAVEN FULL OF COUNTLESS GLITTERING STARS IN FRONT OF IT THEY HEARD TOO THE PLEASANT MINGLED NOTES OF A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FLUTES DRUMS
2989-138035-0045 PSALTERIES PIPES

2989-138035-0049 EVEN WERE IT UNDER GILDED CEILINGS AND SO TURNED ASIDE A LITTLE OUT OF THE ROAD
2989-138035-0050 AS THE GOOD QUARTERS HE HAD ENJOYED IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF DON DIEGO CAME BACK TO HIS MIND
2989-138035-0051 WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH TOGETHER WITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR
2989-138035-0052 SCARCE HAD THE FAIR AURORA GIVEN BRIGHT PHOEBUS TIME TO DRY THE LIQUID PEARLS UPON HER GOLDEN LOCKS WITH THE HEAT OF HIS FERVENT RAYS WHEN DON QUIXOTE SHAKING OFF SLOTH FROM HIS LIMBS
2989-138035-0053 SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND CALLED TO HIS SQUIRE SANCHO WHO WAS STILL SNORING

2989-138035-0066 AND SIX STEWPOTS THAT STOOD ROUND THE BLAZE HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN THE ORDINARY MOULD OF COMMON POTS FOR THEY WERE SIX HALF WINE JARS EACH FIT TO HOLD THE CONTENTS OF A SLAUGHTER HOUSE
2989-138035-0067 THEY SWALLOWED UP WHOLE SHEEP AND HID THEM AWAY IN THEIR INSIDES WITHOUT SHOWING ANY MORE SIGN OF THEM THAN IF THEY WERE PIGEONS
2989-138035-0068 OF OVER SIX GALLONS EACH AND ALL FILLED AS IT PROVED AFTERWARDS WITH GENEROUS WINES THERE WERE BESIDES PILES OF THE WHITEST BREAD LIKE THE HEAPS OF CORN ONE SEES ON THE THRESHING FLOORS
2989-138035-0069 THERE WAS A WALL MADE OF CHEESES ARRANGED LIKE OPEN BRICK WORK AND TWO CAULDRONS FULL OF OIL
2989-138035-0070 AND PLUNGED INTO ANOTHER CAULDRON OF PREPARED HONEY THAT STOOD CLOSE BY OF COOKS AND COOK MAIDS THERE WERE OVER FIFTY ALL CLEAN BRISK AND BLITHE IN THE CAPACIOUS BELLY OF THE OX WERE A DOZEN SOFT LITTLE SUCKING PIGS WHICH SEWN UP THERE

2989-138035-0072 BUT ABUNDANT ENOUGH TO FEED AN ARMY
2989-138035-0073 CONTEMPLATED ALL AND EVERYTHING WON HIS HEART THE FIRST TO CAPTIVATE AND TAKE HIS FANCY WERE THE POTS

2989-138035-0078 DON QUIXOTE WAS WATCHING THE ENTRANCE AT ONE END OF THE ARCADE OF SOME TWELVE PEASANTS ALL IN HOLIDAY AND GALA DRESS
5808-54425-0000 FIVE YEARS IS BUT A SHORT TIME IN THE LIFE OF A MAN AND YET MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN THEREIN FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE WAY OF A FAMILY'S LIFE MAY BE CHANGED GOOD NATURES MAY BE MADE INTO BAD ONES
5808-54425-0001 AND OUT OF A SOUL OF FAITH GROW A SPIRIT OF UNBELIEF THE INDEPENDENCE OF RESPECTABILITY MAY HARDEN INTO THE INSOLENCE OF DEFIANCE AND THE SENSITIVE CHEEK OF MODESTY INTO THE BRAZEN FACE OF SHAMELESSNESS
5808-54425-0002 IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THE HABITS OF YEARS ARE HARD TO CHANGE BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE FIRST SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OF A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE ELSE KITTY HAMILTON AND JOE COULD NOT SO EASILY HAVE BECOME WHAT THEY WERE
5808-54425-0003 IT HAD TAKEN BARELY FIVE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH AN ENTIRE METAMORPHOSIS OF THEIR CHARACTERS IN JOE'S CASE EVEN A SHORTER TIME WAS NEEDED HE WAS SO READY TO GO DOWN THAT IT NEEDED BUT A GENTLE PUSH TO START HIM AND ONCE STARTED
5808-54425-0004 THERE WAS NOTHING WITHIN HIM TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM THE DEPTHS FOR HIS WILL WAS AS FLABBY AS HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS PRIDE WHICH STANDS TO SOME MEN FOR CONSCIENCE HAD NO DEFINITE AIM OR DIRECTION
5808-54425-0005 HATTIE STERLING HAD GIVEN HIM BOTH HIS GREATEST IMPULSE FOR EVIL AND FOR GOOD SHE HAD AT FIRST GIVEN HIM HIS GENTLE PUSH BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HIS COLLAPSE WOULD LOSE HER A FAITHFUL AND USEFUL SLAVE
5808-54425-0006 SHE HAD SOUGHT TO CHECK HIS COURSE HER THREAT OF THE SEVERANCE OF THEIR RELATIONS HAD HELD HIM UP FOR A LITTLE TIME AND SHE BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS SAFE AGAIN HE WENT BACK TO THE WORK HE HAD NEGLECTED DRANK MODERATELY
5808-54425-0007 AND ACTED IN MOST THINGS AS A SOUND SENSIBLE BEING THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WENT DOWN AGAIN AND WENT DOWN BADLY SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND THREW HIM OVER
5808-54425-0008 THEN HE BECAME A HANGER ON AT THE CLUBS A GENTEEL LOAFER HE USED TO SAY IN HIS SOBER MOMENTS THAT AT LAST HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS THAT SADNESS HAD SPOKEN OF HE DID NOT WORK
5808-54425-0009 BUT HE SOON TIRED OF BEING SEPARATED FROM HATTIE AND STRAIGHTENED UP AGAIN AFTER SOME DEMUR SHE RECEIVED HIM UPON HIS FORMER FOOTING IT WAS ONLY FOR A FEW MONTHS HE FELL AGAIN FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS THIS HAD HAPPENED INTERMITTENTLY
5808-54425-0010 FINALLY HE TOOK A TURN FOR THE BETTER THAT ENDURED SO LONG THAT HATTIE STERLING AGAIN GAVE HIM HER FAITH THEN THE WOMAN MADE HER MISTAKE SHE WARMED TO HIM SHE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE WAS PROUD OF HIM
5808-54425-0011 HE WENT FORTH AT ONCE TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY HE DID NOT RETURN TO HER FOR THREE DAYS THEN HE WAS BATTERED UNKEMPT AND THICK OF SPEECH SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENT CONTEMPT FOR A WHILE AS HE SAT NURSING HIS ACHING HEAD
5808-54425-0012 SHE SAID FINALLY WITH CUTTING SCORN YOU OUGHT TO BE PUT UNDER A GLASS CASE AND PLACED ON EXHIBITION HE GROANED AND HIS HEAD SUNK LOWER A DRUNKEN MAN IS ALWAYS DISARMED
5808-54425-0013 HIS HELPLESSNESS INSTEAD OF INSPIRING HER WITH PITY INFLAMED HER WITH AN UNFEELING ANGER THAT BURST FORTH IN A VOLUME OF TAUNTS
5808-54425-0014 NO ONE HAD EVER LOOKED AT YOU UNTIL I PICKED YOU UP AND YOU VE BEEN STRUTTING AROUND EVER SINCE

5808-54425-0017 HE PLEADED STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS TO HER HER EYES BLAZED BACK AT HIM BUT SHE SANG ON INSOLENTLY TAUNTINGLY THE VERY INANITY OF THE MAN DISGUSTED HER
5808-54425-0018 AND ON A SUDDEN IMPULSE SHE SPRANG UP AND STRUCK HIM FULL IN THE FACE WITH THE FLAT OF HER HAND HE WAS TOO WEAK TO RESIST THE BLOW AND TUMBLING FROM THE CHAIR FELL LIMPLY TO THE FLOOR WHERE HE LAY AT HER FEET
5808-54425-0019 ALTERNATELY WEEPING ALOUD AND QUIVERING WITH DRUNKEN HICCOUGHING SOBS

5808-54425-0027 AND HE WAS ABOUT ENTERING UPON A DISCUSSION TO PROVE THAT SADNESS HAD NO SOUL WHEN JOE WITH BLOOD SHOT EYES AND DISHEVELLED CLOTHES STAGGERED IN AND REELED TOWARDS THEM DRUNK AGAIN
5808-54425-0028 SAID SADNESS REALLY IT S A WASTE OF TIME FOR JOE TO SOBER UP HULLO THERE AS THE YOUNG MAN BROUGHT UP AGAINST HIM TAKE A SEAT HE PUT HIM IN A CHAIR AT THE TABLE

7302-86815-0003 THE PROOFS WERE CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCING SINCE THEY RESTED UPON A FEW WORDS WRITTEN BY AN ESCAPED GALLEY SLAVE ON HIS DEATH BED AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY HATRED OR REVENGE
7302-86815-0004 IN ACCUSING HIS COMPANION BUT THE MIND OF THE PROCUREUR WAS MADE UP HE FELT ASSURED THAT BENEDETTO WAS GUILTY AND HE HOPED BY HIS SKILL IN CONDUCTING THIS AGGRAVATED CASE TO FLATTER HIS SELF LOVE
7302-86815-0005 WHICH WAS ABOUT THE ONLY VULNERABLE POINT LEFT IN HIS FROZEN HEART THE CASE WAS THEREFORE PREPARED OWING TO THE INCESSANT LABOR

7302-86815-0008 AND THE GLOOM WHICH OVERSHADOWED THE HOUSE WAS SO RECENT
7302-86815-0009 WHICH WERE THE ONLY MEANS HE HAD OF DISSIPATING HIS GRIEF ONCE ONLY HAD VILLEFORT SEEN HIS FATHER
7302-86815-0010 WHEN THE LATTER WAS TO LEARN HIS FATHER'S NAME THE MAGISTRATE HARASSED AND FATIGUED
7302-86815-0011 SIMILAR TO THAT IN WHICH TARQUIN LOPPED OFF THE TALLEST POPPIES HE BEGAN KNOCKING OFF WITH HIS CANE THE LONG AND DYING BRANCHES OF THE ROSE TREES WHICH PLACED ALONG THE AVENUE
7302-86815-0012 AT ONE OF THE OPEN WINDOWS
7302-86815-0013 WHICH VILLEFORT COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH HIS GLANCE WAS SO FULL OF HATE OF FEROCITY AND SAVAGE IMPATIENCE
7302-86815-0014 TO SEE UPON WHAT PERSON THIS DARK LOOK WAS DIRECTED THEN HE SAW BENEATH A THICK CLUMP OF LINDEN TREES WHICH WERE NEARLY DIVESTED OF FOLIAGE MADAME DE VILLEFORT SITTING WITH A BOOK IN HER HAND
7302-86815-0015 TO SMILE UPON HER SON OR TO THROW BACK HIS ELASTIC BALL WHICH HE OBSTINATELY THREW FROM THE DRAWING ROOM INTO THE GARDEN
7302-86815-0016 HOWEVER AT LENGTH HE DECIDED LEAPED OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO A CLUSTER OF HELIOTROPES AND DAISIES AND RAN TO HIS MOTHER HIS FOREHEAD STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION
7302-86815-0017 PRESSED HER LIPS UPON IT AND SENT HIM BACK WITH THE BALL IN ONE HAND AND SOME BONBONS IN THE OTHER
7302-86815-0018 LIKE THAT OF THE BIRD TO THE SERPENT WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AS HE APPROACHED IT
7302-86815-0019 FELT THEM PIERCE TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART IN THAT EARNEST LOOK
7302-86815-0020 AS WELL AS A TERRIBLE MENACE THEN NOIRTIER RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN
7302-86815-0021 IT IS WELL SIR REPLIED VILLEFORT FROM BELOW IT IS WELL HAVE PATIENCE BUT ONE DAY LONGER WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL DO NOIRTIER SEEMED TO BE CALMED BY THESE WORDS
7302-86815-0022 AND TURNED HIS EYES WITH INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER SIDE
7302-86815-0023 WHICH SEEMED TO STRANGLE HIM AND PASSING HIS LIVID HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD ENTERED HIS STUDY THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND STILL THE FAMILY HAD ALL RETIRED TO REST BUT VILLEFORT WHO ALONE REMAINED UP

7302-86815-0025 WHICH STOOD OUT IN BLACK RELIEF ON THE HORIZON IN THE CLOVER FIELDS BEYOND THE CHESTNUT TREES A LARK WAS MOUNTING UP TO HEAVEN WHILE POURING OUT HER CLEAR MORNING SONG
7302-86815-0026 AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY TO DAY HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT TO DAY THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE BLADE OF JUSTICE MUST STRIKE WHEREVER THERE IS GUILT INVOLUNTARILY HIS EYES WANDERED TOWARDS THE WINDOW
7302-86815-0027 OF NOIRTIER'S ROOM WHERE HE HAD SEEN HIM THE PRECEDING NIGHT THE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN AND YET THE IMAGE OF HIS FATHER WAS SO VIVID TO HIS MIND THAT HE ADDRESSED THE CLOSED WINDOW AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN OPEN
7302-86815-0028 AND AS IF THROUGH THE OPENING HE HAD BEHELD THE MENACING OLD MAN YES HE MURMURED YES BE SATISFIED HIS HEAD DROPPED UPON HIS CHEST AND IN THIS POSITION HE PACED HIS STUDY
7302-86815-0029 THEN HE THREW HIMSELF DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON A SOFA LESS TO SLEEP THAN TO REST HIS LIMBS CRAMPED WITH COLD AND STUDY BY DEGREES EVERY ONE AWOKE

2910-131096-0000 A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
2910-131096-0001 THAT STRANGERS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES CAME IN CROWDS TO ENJOY THE SIGHT AND LOOKED ON HER WITH AMAZEMENT PAYING HER THAT HOMAGE WHICH IS DUE ONLY TO VENUS HERSELF IN FACT VENUS FOUND HER ALTARS DESERTED
2910-131096-0002 WHILE MEN TURNED THEIR DEVOTION TO THIS YOUNG VIRGIN AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE PEOPLE SANG HER PRAISES AND STREWED HER WAY WITH CHAPLETS AND FLOWERS THIS PERVERSION OF HOMAGE DUE ONLY TO THE IMMORTAL POWERS TO THE EXALTATION OF A MORTAL
2910-131096-0003 GAVE GREAT OFFENCE TO THE REAL VENUS SHAKING HER AMBROSIAL LOCKS WITH INDIGNATION SHE EXCLAIMED AM I THEN TO BE ECLIPSED IN MY HONORS BY A MORTAL GIRL IN VAIN THEN DID THAT ROYAL SHEPHERD WHOSE JUDGMENT WAS APPROVED BY JOVE HIMSELF
2910-131096-0004 GIVE ME THE PALM OF BEAUTY OVER MY ILLUSTRIOUS RIVALS PALLAS AND JUNO BUT SHE SHALL NOT SO QUIETLY USURP MY HONORS I WILL GIVE HER CAUSE TO REPENT OF SO UNLAWFUL A BEAUTY
2910-131096-0005 MISCHIEVOUS ENOUGH IN HIS OWN NATURE AND ROUSES AND PROVOKES HIM YET MORE BY HER COMPLAINTS SHE POINTS OUT PSYCHE TO HIM AND SAYS MY DEAR SON PUNISH THAT CONTUMACIOUS BEAUTY GIVE THY MOTHER A REVENGE AS SWEET AS HER INJURIES ARE GREAT
2910-131096-0006 INFUSE INTO THE BOSOM OF THAT HAUGHTY GIRL A PASSION FOR SOME LOW MEAN UNWORTHY BEING SO THAT SHE MAY REAP A MORTIFICATION AS GREAT AS HER PRESENT EXULTATION AND TRIUMPH CUPID PREPARED TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MOTHER
2910-131096-0007 THERE ARE TWO FOUNTAINS IN VENUS'S GARDEN ONE OF SWEET WATERS THE OTHER OF BITTER CUPID FILLED TWO AMBER VASES ONE FROM EACH FOUNTAIN AND SUSPENDING THEM FROM THE TOP OF HIS QUIVER HASTENED TO THE CHAMBER OF PSYCHE WHOM HE FOUND ASLEEP
2910-131096-0008 HE SHED A FEW DROPS FROM THE BITTER FOUNTAIN OVER HER LIPS THOUGH THE SIGHT OF HER ALMOST MOVED HIM TO PITY THEN TOUCHED HER SIDE WITH THE POINT OF HIS ARROW AT THE TOUCH SHE AWOKE AND OPENED EYES UPON CUPID HIMSELF INVISIBLE
2910-131096-0009 WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
2910-131096-0010 PSYCHE HENCEFORTH FROWNED UPON BY VENUS DERIVED NO BENEFIT FROM ALL HER CHARMS TRUE ALL EYES WERE CAST EAGERLY UPON HER AND EVERY MOUTH SPOKE HER PRAISES
2910-131096-0011 HER TWO ELDER SISTERS OF MODERATE CHARMS HAD NOW LONG BEEN MARRIED TO TWO ROYAL PRINCES BUT PSYCHE IN HER LONELY APARTMENT DEPLORED HER SOLITUDE SICK OF THAT BEAUTY WHICH WHILE IT PROCURED ABUNDANCE OF FLATTERY HAD FAILED TO AWAKEN LOVE
2910-131096-0012 CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF APOLLO AND RECEIVED THIS ANSWER THE VIRGIN IS DESTINED FOR THE BRIDE OF NO MORTAL LOVER HER FUTURE HUSBAND AWAITS HER ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HE IS A MONSTER WHOM NEITHER GODS NOR MEN CAN RESIST
2910-131096-0013 THIS DREADFUL DECREE OF THE ORACLE FILLED ALL THE PEOPLE WITH DISMAY AND HER PARENTS ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO GRIEF BUT PSYCHE SAID WHY MY DEAR PARENTS DO YOU NOW LAMENT ME
2910-131096-0014 YOU SHOULD RATHER HAVE GRIEVED WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOWERED UPON ME UNDESERVED HONORS AND WITH ONE VOICE CALLED ME A VENUS I NOW PERCEIVE THAT I AM A VICTIM TO THAT NAME I SUBMIT LEAD ME TO THAT ROCK TO WHICH MY UNHAPPY FATE HAS DESTINED ME
2910-131096-0015 ACCORDINGLY ALL THINGS BEING PREPARED THE ROYAL MAID TOOK HER PLACE IN THE PROCESSION WHICH MORE RESEMBLED A FUNERAL THAN A NUPTIAL POMP AND WITH HER PARENTS AMID THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN
2910-131096-0016 ON THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THEY LEFT HER ALONE AND WITH SORROWFUL HEARTS RETURNED HOME WHILE PSYCHE STOOD ON THE RIDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN PANTING WITH FEAR AND WITH EYES FULL OF TEARS THE GENTLE ZEPHYR RAISED HER FROM THE EARTH
2910-131096-0017 AND BORE HER WITH AN EASY MOTION INTO A FLOWERY DALE BY DEGREES HER MIND BECAME COMPOSED AND SHE LAID HERSELF DOWN ON THE GRASSY BANK TO SLEEP WHEN SHE AWOKE
2910-131096-0018 SHE ENTERED IT AND IN THE MIDST DISCOVERED A FOUNTAIN SENDING FORTH CLEAR AND CRYSTAL WATERS AND FAST BY A MAGNIFICENT PALACE WHOSE AUGUST FRONT IMPRESSED THE SPECTATOR THAT IT WAS NOT THE WORK OF MORTAL HANDS
2910-131096-0019 BUT THE HAPPY RETREAT OF SOME GOD DRAWN BY ADMIRATION AND WONDER SHE APPROACHED THE BUILDING AND VENTURED TO ENTER EVERY OBJECT SHE MET FILLED HER WITH PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT GOLDEN PILLARS SUPPORTED THE VAULTED ROOF
2910-131096-0020 AND THE WALLS WERE ENRICHED WITH CARVINGS AND PAINTINGS REPRESENTING BEASTS OF THE CHASE AND RURAL SCENES ADAPTED TO DELIGHT THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER PROCEEDING ONWARD SHE PERCEIVED THAT BESIDES THE APARTMENTS OF STATE
2910-131096-0021 THERE WERE OTHERS FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF TREASURES AND BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE AND ART WHILE HER EYES WERE THUS OCCUPIED A VOICE ADDRESSED HER THOUGH SHE SAW NO ONE UTTERING THESE WORDS SOVEREIGN LADY
2910-131096-0022 RETIRE THEREFORE TO YOUR CHAMBER AND REPOSE ON YOUR BED OF DOWN AND WHEN YOU SEE FIT REPAIR TO THE BATH SUPPER AWAITS YOU IN THE ADJOINING ALCOVE WHEN IT PLEASES YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEAT THERE PSYCHE GAVE EAR TO THE ADMONITIONS OF HER VOCAL ATTENDANTS
2910-131096-0023 AND AFTER REPOSE AND THE REFRESHMENT OF THE BATH SEATED HERSELF IN THE ALCOVE WHERE A TABLE IMMEDIATELY PRESENTED ITSELF WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE AID FROM WAITERS OR SERVANTS AND COVERED WITH THE GREATEST DELICACIES OF FOOD AND THE MOST NECTAREOUS WINES
2910-131096-0024 HER EARS TOO WERE FEASTED WITH MUSIC FROM INVISIBLE PERFORMERS OF WHOM ONE SANG ANOTHER PLAYED ON THE LUTE AND ALL CLOSED IN THE WONDERFUL HARMONY OF A FULL CHORUS SHE HAD NOT YET SEEN HER DESTINED HUSBAND
2910-131096-0025 BUT HIS ACCENTS WERE FULL OF LOVE AND INSPIRED A LIKE PASSION IN HER SHE OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STAY AND LET HER BEHOLD HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT ON THE CONTRARY HE CHARGED HER TO MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE HIM
2910-131096-0026 FOR IT WAS HIS PLEASURE FOR THE BEST OF REASONS TO KEEP CONCEALED WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO BEHOLD ME HE SAID HAVE YOU ANY DOUBT OF MY LOVE HAVE YOU ANY WISH UNGRATIFIED IF YOU SAW ME PERHAPS YOU WOULD FEAR ME PERHAPS ADORE ME
2910-131096-0027 BUT ALL I ASK OF YOU IS TO LOVE ME I WOULD RATHER YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS AN EQUAL THAN ADORE ME AS A GOD THIS REASONING SOMEWHAT QUIETED PSYCHE FOR A TIME AND WHILE THE NOVELTY LASTED SHE FELT QUITE HAPPY
2910-131096-0028 BUT AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF HER FATE
2910-131096-0029 PREYED ON HER MIND AND MADE HER BEGIN TO FEEL HER PALACE AS BUT A SPLENDID PRISON WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME ONE NIGHT SHE TOLD HIM HER DISTRESS AND AT LAST DREW FROM HIM AN UNWILLING CONSENT THAT HER SISTERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO SEE HER
2910-131096-0030 SO CALLING ZEPHYR SHE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS AND HE PROMPTLY OBEDIENT SOON BROUGHT THEM ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO THEIR SISTER'S VALLEY THEY EMBRACED HER AND SHE RETURNED THEIR CARESSES COME SAID PSYCHE
2910-131096-0031 ENTER WITH ME MY HOUSE AND REFRESH YOURSELVES WITH WHATEVER YOUR SISTER HAS TO OFFER THEN TAKING THEIR HANDS SHE LED THEM INTO HER GOLDEN PALACE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE CARE OF HER NUMEROUS TRAIN OF ATTENDANT VOICES TO REFRESH THEM IN HER BATHS
2910-131096-0032 AND AT HER TABLE AND TO SHOW THEM ALL HER TREASURES THE VIEW OF THESE CELESTIAL DELIGHTS CAUSED ENVY TO ENTER THEIR BOSOMS AT SEEING THEIR YOUNG SISTER POSSESSED OF SUCH STATE AND SPLENDOR SO MUCH EXCEEDING THEIR OWN
2910-131096-0033 THEY ASKED HER NUMBERLESS QUESTIONS AMONG OTHERS WHAT SORT OF A PERSON HER HUSBAND WAS PSYCHE REPLIED THAT HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WHO GENERALLY SPENT THE DAYTIME IN HUNTING UPON THE MOUNTAINS THE SISTERS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY
2910-131096-0034 SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
2910-131096-0035 THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VALLEY SAY THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS A TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS SERPENT WHO NOURISHES YOU FOR A WHILE WITH DAINTIES THAT HE MAY BY AND BY DEVOUR YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A LAMP AND A SHARP KNIFE
2910-131096-0036 PUT THEM IN CONCEALMENT THAT YOUR HUSBAND MAY NOT DISCOVER THEM AND WHEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP SLIP OUT OF BED BRING FORTH YOUR LAMP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE OR NOT IF IT IS HESITATE NOT TO CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD AND THEREBY RECOVER YOUR LIBERTY
2910-131096-0037 PSYCHE RESISTED THESE PERSUASIONS AS WELL AS SHE COULD BUT THEY DID NOT FAIL TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT ON HER MIND AND WHEN HER SISTERS WERE GONE THEIR WORDS AND HER OWN CURIOSITY WERE TOO STRONG FOR HER TO RESIST SO SHE PREPARED HER LAMP
2910-131096-0038 AND A SHARP KNIFE AND HID THEM OUT OF SIGHT OF HER HUSBAND WHEN HE HAD FALLEN INTO HIS FIRST SLEEP SHE SILENTLY ROSE AND UNCOVERING HER LAMP BEHELD NOT A HIDEOUS MONSTER BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING OF THE GODS
2910-131096-0039 WITH TWO DEWY WINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS WHITER THAN SNOW AND WITH SHINING FEATHERS LIKE THE TENDER BLOSSOMS OF SPRING AS SHE LEANED THE LAMP OVER TO HAVE A NEARER VIEW OF HIS FACE A DROP OF BURNING OIL FELL ON THE SHOULDER OF THE GOD
2910-131096-0040 STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
2910-131096-0041 CUPID BEHOLDING HER AS SHE LAY IN THE DUST STOPPED HIS FLIGHT FOR AN INSTANT AND SAID O FOOLISH PSYCHE IS IT THUS YOU REPAY MY LOVE AFTER HAVING DISOBEYED MY MOTHER'S COMMANDS AND MADE YOU MY WIFE WILL YOU THINK ME A MONSTER AND CUT OFF MY HEAD
2910-131096-0042 BUT GO RETURN TO YOUR SISTERS WHOSE ADVICE YOU SEEM TO THINK PREFERABLE TO MINE I INFLICT NO OTHER PUNISHMENT ON YOU THAN TO LEAVE YOU FOREVER LOVE CANNOT DWELL WITH SUSPICION SO SAYING HE FLED AWAY LEAVING POOR PSYCHE PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND
2910-131096-0043 FILLING THE PLACE WITH MOURNFUL LAMENTATIONS WHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE SHE LOOKED AROUND HER BUT THE PALACE AND GARDENS HAD VANISHED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE OPEN FIELD NOT FAR FROM THE CITY WHERE HER SISTERS DWELT
2910-131096-0044 PSYCHE MEANWHILE WANDERED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT FOOD OR REPOSE IN SEARCH OF HER HUSBAND CASTING HER EYES ON A LOFTY MOUNTAIN HAVING ON ITS BROW A MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE SHE SIGHED AND SAID TO HERSELF PERHAPS MY LOVE MY LORD INHABITS THERE
2910-131096-0045 AND DIRECTED HER STEPS THITHER SHE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN SHE SAW HEAPS OF CORN SOME IN LOOSE EARS AND SOME IN SHEAVES WITH MINGLED EARS OF BARLEY
2910-131096-0046 SCATTERED ABOUT LAY SICKLES AND RAKES AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF HARVEST WITHOUT ORDER AS IF THROWN CARELESSLY OUT OF THE WEARY REAPERS HANDS IN THE SULTRY HOURS OF THE DAY THIS UNSEEMLY CONFUSION
2910-131096-0047 BY SEPARATING AND SORTING EVERYTHING TO ITS PROPER PLACE AND KIND
2910-131096-0048 TO ENGAGE THEM ALL IN HER BEHALF THE HOLY CERES WHOSE TEMPLE IT WAS FINDING HER SO RELIGIOUSLY EMPLOYED THUS SPOKE TO HER O PSYCHE TRULY WORTHY OF OUR PITY THOUGH I CANNOT SHIELD YOU FROM THE FROWNS OF VENUS
2910-131096-0049 YET I CAN TEACH YOU HOW BEST TO ALLAY HER DISPLEASURE GO THEN AND VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER YOURSELF TO YOUR LADY AND SOVEREIGN AND TRY BY MODESTY AND SUBMISSION TO WIN HER FORGIVENESS AND PERHAPS HER FAVOR WILL RESTORE YOU THE HUSBAND YOU HAVE LOST
2910-131096-0050 PSYCHE OBEYED THE COMMANDS OF CERES AND TOOK HER WAY TO THE TEMPLE OF VENUS ENDEAVORING TO FORTIFY HER MIND AND RUMINATING ON WHAT SHE SHOULD SAY AND HOW BEST PROPITIATE THE ANGRY GODDESS FEELING THAT THE ISSUE WAS DOUBTFUL AND PERHAPS FATAL
2910-131096-0051 MOST UNDUTIFUL AND FAITHLESS OF SERVANTS SAID SHE DO YOU AT LAST REMEMBER THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A MISTRESS OR HAVE YOU RATHER COME TO SEE YOUR SICK HUSBAND YET LAID UP OF THE WOUND GIVEN HIM BY HIS LOVING WIFE YOU ARE SO ILL FAVORED AND DISAGREEABLE
2910-131096-0052 THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MERIT YOUR LOVER MUST BE BY DINT OF INDUSTRY AND DILIGENCE I WILL MAKE TRIAL OF YOUR HOUSEWIFERY THEN SHE ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE LED TO THE STOREHOUSE OF HER TEMPLE
2910-131096-0053 WHERE WAS LAID UP A GREAT QUANTITY OF WHEAT BARLEY MILLET VETCHES BEANS AND LENTILS PREPARED FOR FOOD FOR HER PIGEONS AND SAID TAKE AND SEPARATE ALL THESE GRAINS PUTTING ALL OF THE SAME KIND IN A PARCEL BY THEMSELVES
2910-131096-0054 AND SEE THAT YOU GET IT DONE BEFORE EVENING THEN VENUS DEPARTED AND LEFT HER TO HER TASK BUT PSYCHE IN A PERFECT CONSTERNATION AT THE ENORMOUS WORK SAT STUPID AND SILENT WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER TO THE INEXTRICABLE HEAP
2910-131096-0055 WHILE SHE SAT DESPAIRING CUPID STIRRED UP THE LITTLE ANT A NATIVE OF THE FIELDS TO TAKE COMPASSION ON HER THE LEADER OF THE ANT HILL FOLLOWED BY WHOLE HOSTS OF HIS SIX LEGGED SUBJECTS
2910-131096-0056 APPROACHED THE HEAP AND WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE TAKING GRAIN BY GRAIN THEY SEPARATED THE PILE SORTING EACH KIND TO ITS PARCEL AND WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE THEY VANISHED OUT OF SIGHT IN A MOMENT
2910-131096-0057 VENUS AT THE APPROACH OF TWILIGHT RETURNED FROM THE BANQUET OF THE GODS BREATHING ODORS AND CROWNED WITH ROSES SEEING THE TASK DONE SHE EXCLAIMED THIS IS NO WORK OF YOURS WICKED ONE
2910-131096-0058 SO SAYING SHE THREW HER A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD FOR HER SUPPER AND WENT AWAY NEXT MORNING VENUS ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE CALLED AND SAID TO HER BEHOLD YONDER GROVE WHICH STRETCHES ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE WATER
2910-131096-0059 THERE YOU WILL FIND SHEEP FEEDING WITHOUT A SHEPHERD WITH GOLDEN SHINING FLEECES ON THEIR BACKS GO FETCH ME A SAMPLE OF THAT PRECIOUS WOOL GATHERED FROM EVERY ONE OF THEIR FLEECES
2910-131096-0060 PSYCHE OBEDIENTLY WENT TO THE RIVERSIDE PREPARED TO DO HER BEST TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND BUT THE RIVER GOD INSPIRED THE REEDS WITH HARMONIOUS MURMURS WHICH SEEMED TO SAY O MAIDEN SEVERELY TRIED TEMPT NOT THE DANGEROUS FLOOD
2910-131096-0061 NOR VENTURE AMONG THE FORMIDABLE RAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE RISING SUN THEY BURN WITH A CRUEL RAGE TO DESTROY MORTALS WITH THEIR SHARP HORNS OR RUDE TEETH BUT WHEN THE NOONTIDE SUN HAS DRIVEN THE CATTLE TO THE SHADE
2910-131096-0062 AND THE SERENE SPIRIT OF THE FLOOD HAS LULLED THEM TO REST YOU MAY THEN CROSS IN SAFETY AND YOU WILL FIND THE WOOLLY GOLD STICKING TO THE BUSHES AND THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES THUS THE COMPASSIONATE RIVER GOD GAVE PSYCHE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO ACCOMPLISH HER TASK
2910-131096-0063 AND BY OBSERVING HIS DIRECTIONS SHE SOON RETURNED TO VENUS WITH HER ARMS FULL OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BUT SHE RECEIVED NOT THE APPROBATION OF HER IMPLACABLE MISTRESS WHO SAID I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS BY NONE OF YOUR OWN DOINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS TASK
2910-131096-0064 AND I AM NOT SATISFIED YET THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL BUT I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU HERE TAKE THIS BOX AND GO YOUR WAY TO THE INFERNAL SHADES AND GIVE THIS BOX TO PROSERPINE

2910-131096-0066 PSYCHE WAS NOW SATISFIED THAT HER DESTRUCTION WAS AT HAND BEING OBLIGED TO GO WITH HER OWN FEET DIRECTLY DOWN TO EREBUS WHEREFORE TO MAKE NO DELAY OF WHAT WAS NOT TO BE AVOIDED
2910-131096-0067 SHE GOES TO THE TOP OF A HIGH TOWER TO PRECIPITATE HERSELF HEADLONG THUS TO DESCEND THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE SHADES BELOW BUT A VOICE FROM THE TOWER SAID TO HER WHY POOR UNLUCKY GIRL DOST THOU DESIGN TO PUT AN END TO THY DAYS IN SO DREADFUL A MANNER
2910-131096-0068 AND WHAT COWARDICE MAKES THEE SINK UNDER THIS LAST DANGER WHO HAST BEEN SO MIRACULOUSLY SUPPORTED IN ALL THY FORMER THEN THE VOICE TOLD HER HOW BY A CERTAIN CAVE SHE MIGHT REACH THE REALMS OF PLUTO AND HOW TO AVOID ALL THE DANGERS OF THE ROAD
2910-131096-0069 BUT THE VOICE ADDED WHEN PROSERPINE HAS GIVEN YOU THE BOX FILLED WITH HER BEAUTY OF ALL THINGS THIS IS CHIEFLY TO BE OBSERVED BY YOU
2910-131096-0070 PSYCHE ENCOURAGED BY THIS ADVICE OBEYED IT IN ALL THINGS AND TAKING HEED TO HER WAYS TRAVELLED SAFELY TO THE KINGDOM OF PLUTO SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE PALACE OF PROSERPINE
2910-131096-0071 AND WITHOUT ACCEPTING THE DELICATE SEAT OR DELICIOUS BANQUET THAT WAS OFFERED HER BUT CONTENTED WITH COARSE BREAD FOR HER FOOD SHE DELIVERED HER MESSAGE FROM VENUS PRESENTLY THE BOX WAS RETURNED TO HER SHUT AND FILLED WITH THE PRECIOUS COMMODITY
2910-131096-0072 THEN SHE RETURNED THE WAY SHE CAME AND GLAD WAS SHE TO COME OUT ONCE MORE INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY BUT HAVING GOT SO FAR SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH HER DANGEROUS TASK A LONGING DESIRE SEIZED HER TO EXAMINE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX
2910-131096-0073 WHAT SAID SHE SHALL I THE CARRIER OF THIS DIVINE BEAUTY NOT TAKE THE LEAST BIT TO PUT ON MY CHEEKS TO APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE IN THE EYES OF MY BELOVED HUSBAND SO SHE CAREFULLY OPENED THE BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING THERE OF ANY BEAUTY AT ALL
2910-131096-0074 BUT AN INFERNAL AND TRULY STYGIAN SLEEP WHICH BEING THUS SET FREE FROM ITS PRISON TOOK POSSESSION OF HER AND SHE FELL DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE ROAD A SLEEPY CORPSE WITHOUT SENSE OR MOTION BUT CUPID BEING NOW RECOVERED FROM HIS WOUND
2910-131096-0075 AND NOT ABLE LONGER TO BEAR THE ABSENCE OF HIS BELOVED PSYCHE SLIPPING THROUGH THE SMALLEST CRACK OF THE WINDOW OF HIS CHAMBER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN FLEW TO THE SPOT WHERE PSYCHE LAY
2910-131096-0076 AND GATHERING UP THE SLEEP FROM HER BODY CLOSED IT AGAIN IN THE BOX AND WAKED PSYCHE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH OF ONE OF HIS ARROWS AGAIN SAID HE HAST THOU ALMOST PERISHED BY THE SAME CURIOSITY
2910-131096-0077 BUT NOW PERFORM EXACTLY THE TASK IMPOSED ON YOU BY MY MOTHER AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST THEN CUPID AS SWIFT AS LIGHTNING PENETRATING THE HEIGHTS OF HEAVEN PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE JUPITER WITH HIS SUPPLICATION JUPITER LENT A FAVORING EAR
2910-131096-0078 AND PLEADED THE CAUSE OF THE LOVERS SO EARNESTLY WITH VENUS THAT HE WON HER CONSENT ON THIS HE SENT MERCURY TO BRING PSYCHE UP TO THE HEAVENLY ASSEMBLY AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED HANDING HER A CUP OF AMBROSIA HE SAID DRINK THIS PSYCHE AND BE IMMORTAL

2910-131096-0088 SHE HEARD FAR ECHOES OF THE VOICE OF LOVE AND FOUND HIS FOOTSTEPS TRACES EVERYWHERE BUT NEVERMORE THEY MET SINCE DOUBTS AND FEARS THOSE PHANTOM SHAPES THAT HAUNT AND BLIGHT THE EARTH HAD COME TWIXT HER A CHILD OF SIN AND TEARS
2910-131096-0089 AND THAT BRIGHT SPIRIT OF IMMORTAL BIRTH UNTIL HER PINING SOUL AND WEEPING EYES HAD LEARNED TO SEEK HIM ONLY IN THE SKIES TILL WINGS UNTO THE WEARY HEART WERE GIVEN AND SHE BECAME LOVE'S ANGEL BRIDE IN HEAVEN
2910-131096-0090 THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE FIRST APPEARS IN THE WORKS OF APULEIUS A WRITER OF THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA IT IS THEREFORE OF MUCH MORE RECENT DATE THAN MOST OF THE LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF FABLE IT IS THIS THAT KEATS ALLUDES TO IN HIS ODE TO PSYCHE
2910-131096-0091 O LATEST BORN AND LOVELIEST VISION FAR OF ALL OLYMPUS FADED HIERARCHY FAIRER THAN PHOEBE'S SAPPHIRE REGIONED STAR OR VESPER AMOROUS GLOW WORM OF THE SKY FAIRER THAN THESE THOUGH TEMPLE THOU HAST NONE

1926-147979-0000 WINTER LIES TOO LONG IN COUNTRY TOWNS HANGS ON UNTIL IT IS STALE AND SHABBY OLD AND SULLEN ON THE FARM THE WEATHER WAS THE GREAT FACT AND MEN'S AFFAIRS WENT ON UNDERNEATH IT AS THE STREAMS CREEP UNDER THE ICE
1926-147979-0001 BUT IN BLACK HAWK THE SCENE OF HUMAN LIFE WAS SPREAD OUT SHRUNKEN AND PINCHED FROZEN DOWN TO THE BARE STALK
1926-147979-0002 THROUGH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY I WENT TO THE RIVER WITH THE HARLINGS ON CLEAR NIGHTS AND WE SKATED UP TO THE BIG ISLAND AND MADE BONFIRES ON THE FROZEN SAND BUT BY MARCH THE ICE WAS ROUGH AND CHOPPY
1926-147979-0003 AT OUR COMFORTABLE HOTEL MISSUS HARLING HAD KNOWN D'ARNAULT FOR YEARS
1926-147979-0004 THE WIND FROM WITHOUT MADE WAVES IN THE LONG CARPET A COAL STOVE GLOWED AT EITHER END OF THE ROOM AND THE GRAND PIANO IN THE MIDDLE STOOD OPEN THERE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNUSUAL FREEDOM ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT
1926-147979-0005 FOR MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA FOR A WEEK JOHNNIE HAD BEEN HAVING DRINKS WITH THE GUESTS UNTIL HE WAS RATHER ABSENT MINDED IT WAS MISSUS GARDENER WHO RAN THE BUSINESS AND LOOKED AFTER EVERYTHING HER HUSBAND STOOD AT THE DESK AND WELCOMED INCOMING TRAVELERS
1926-147979-0006 HE WAS A POPULAR FELLOW BUT NO MANAGER MISSUS GARDENER WAS ADMITTEDLY THE BEST DRESSED WOMAN IN BLACK HAWK DROVE THE BEST HORSE AND HAD A SMART TRAP AND A LITTLE WHITE AND GOLD SLEIGH
1926-147979-0007 SHE SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO HER POSSESSIONS WAS NOT HALF SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT THEM AS HER FRIENDS WERE SHE WAS TALL DARK SEVERE WITH SOMETHING INDIAN LIKE IN THE RIGID IMMOBILITY OF HER FACE HER MANNER WAS COLD AND SHE TALKED LITTLE
1926-147979-0008 GUESTS FELT THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING NOT CONFERRING A FAVOR WHEN THEY STAYED AT HER HOUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST TRAVELING MEN WERE FLATTERED WHEN MISSUS GARDENER STOPPED TO CHAT WITH THEM FOR A MOMENT
1926-147979-0009 TWO CLASSES THOSE WHO HAD SEEN MISSUS GARDENER'S DIAMONDS AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT WHEN I STOLE INTO THE PARLOR ANSON KIRKPATRICK MARSHALL FIELD'S MAN
1926-147979-0010 HE WAS A DAPPER LITTLE IRISHMAN VERY VAIN HOMELY AS A MONKEY WITH FRIENDS EVERYWHERE AND A SWEETHEART IN EVERY PORT LIKE A SAILOR I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE MEN WHO WERE SITTING ABOUT BUT I RECOGNIZED A FURNITURE SALESMAN FROM KANSAS CITY
1926-147979-0011 A DRUG MAN AND WILLY O'REILLY WHO TRAVELED FOR A JEWELRY HOUSE AND SOLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS THE TALK WAS ALL ABOUT GOOD AND BAD HOTELS ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND MUSICAL PRODIGIES I LEARNED THAT MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA TO HEAR BOOTH AND BARRETT
1926-147979-0012 WHO WERE TO PLAY THERE NEXT WEEK AND THAT MARY ANDERSON WAS HAVING A GREAT SUCCESS IN A WINTER'S TALE IN LONDON THE DOOR FROM THE OFFICE OPENED AND JOHNNIE GARDENER CAME IN DIRECTING BLIND D'ARNAULT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO BE LED
1926-147979-0013 HIS YELLOW FACE WAS LIFTED IN THE LIGHT WITH A SHOW OF WHITE TEETH ALL GRINNING AND HIS SHRUNKEN PAPERY EYELIDS LAY MOTIONLESS OVER HIS BLIND EYES GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN NO LADIES HERE GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN
1926-147979-0014 WE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC SOME OF YOU GENTLEMEN GOING TO PLAY FOR ME THIS EVENING IT WAS THE SOFT AMIABLE NEGRO VOICE LIKE THOSE I REMEMBERED FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH THE NOTE OF DOCILE SUBSERVIENCE IN IT
1926-147979-0015 HE HAD THE NEGRO HEAD TOO ALMOST NO HEAD AT ALL NOTHING BEHIND THE EARS BUT FOLDS OF NECK UNDER CLOSE CLIPPED WOOL
1926-147979-0016 WHEN HE WAS SITTING OR STANDING STILL HE SWAYED BACK AND FORTH INCESSANTLY LIKE A ROCKING TOY AT THE PIANO HE SWAYED IN TIME TO THE MUSIC AND WHEN HE WAS NOT PLAYING HIS BODY KEPT UP THIS MOTION LIKE AN EMPTY MILL GRINDING ON
1926-147979-0017 NOW GENTLEMEN I EXPECT YOU'VE ALL GOT GRAND VOICES SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME GOOD OLD PLANTATION SONGS TO NIGHT THE MEN GATHERED ROUND HIM AS HE BEGAN TO PLAY MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME THEY SANG ONE NEGRO MELODY AFTER ANOTHER
1926-147979-0018 WHILE THE MULATTO SAT ROCKING HIMSELF HIS HEAD THROWN BACK HIS YELLOW FACE LIFTED ITS SHRIVELED EYELIDS NEVER FLUTTERING HE WAS BORN IN THE FAR SOUTH ON THE D'ARNAULT PLANTATION WHERE THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE FACT OF SLAVERY PERSISTED
1926-147979-0019 WHEN HE WAS THREE WEEKS OLD HE HAD AN ILLNESS WHICH LEFT HIM TOTALLY BLIND
1926-147979-0020 HIS MOTHER A BUXOM YOUNG NEGRO WENCH WHO WAS LAUNDRESS FOR THE D'ARNAULTS CONCLUDED THAT HER BLIND BABY WAS NOT RIGHT IN HIS HEAD AND SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HIM SHE LOVED HIM DEVOTEDLY BUT HE WAS SO UGLY WITH HIS SUNKEN EYES AND HIS FIDGETS
1926-147979-0021 THAT SHE HID HIM AWAY FROM PEOPLE ALL THE DAINTIES SHE BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE BIG HOUSE WERE FOR THE BLIND CHILD AND SHE BEAT AND CUFFED HER OTHER CHILDREN WHENEVER SHE FOUND THEM TEASING HIM OR TRYING TO GET HIS CHICKEN BONE AWAY FROM HIM HE BEGAN TO TALK EARLY
1926-147979-0022 AND HIS MAMMY SAID HE WAS N'T ALL WRONG SHE NAMED HIM SAMSON BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND BUT ON THE PLANTATION HE WAS KNOWN AS YELLOW MARTHA'S SIMPLE CHILD
1926-147979-0023 HE WAS DOCILE AND OBEDIENT BUT WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HE BEGAN TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME ALWAYS TAKING THE SAME DIRECTION HE FELT HIS WAY THROUGH THE LILACS ALONG THE BOXWOOD HEDGE
1926-147979-0024 WHENEVER SHE CAUGHT HIM SLIPPING AWAY FROM THE CABIN SHE WHIPPED HIM UNMERCIFULLY AND TOLD HIM WHAT DREADFUL THINGS OLD MISTER D'ARNAULT WOULD DO TO HIM IF HE EVER FOUND HIM NEAR THE BIG HOUSE BUT THE NEXT TIME SAMSON HAD A CHANCE HE RAN AWAY AGAIN
1926-147979-0025 AND WENT TOWARD THE WINDOW SHE SAW THIS HIDEOUS LITTLE PICKANINNY DRESSED IN AN OLD PIECE OF SACKING STANDING IN THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE HOLLYHOCK ROWS HIS BODY ROCKING AUTOMATICALLY HIS BLIND FACE LIFTED
1926-147979-0026 THOUGH IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MORE OF IT THAN OTHER CHILDREN ONE DAY SAMSON WAS STANDING THUS WHILE MISS NELLIE WAS PLAYING HER LESSON TO HER MUSIC MASTER THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN
1926-147979-0027 TALK A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN LEAVE THE ROOM HE HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE AFTER THEM HE CREPT UP TO THE FRONT WINDOWS AND STUCK HIS HEAD IN THERE WAS NO ONE THERE HE COULD ALWAYS DETECT THE PRESENCE OF ANY ONE IN A ROOM
1926-147979-0028 HE PUT ONE FOOT OVER THE WINDOW SILL AND STRADDLED IT HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM OVER AND OVER HOW HIS MASTER WOULD GIVE HIM TO THE BIG MASTIFF IF HE EVER FOUND HIM MEDDLING SAMSON HAD GOT TOO NEAR THE MASTIFF'S KENNEL ONCE AND HAD FELT HIS TERRIBLE BREATH IN HIS FACE
1926-147979-0029 HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT HE PULLED IN HIS OTHER FOOT THROUGH THE DARK HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE THING TO ITS MOUTH HE TOUCHED IT SOFTLY AND IT ANSWERED SOFTLY KINDLY HE SHIVERED AND STOOD STILL
1926-147979-0030 THEN HE BEGAN TO FEEL IT ALL OVER RAN HIS FINGER TIPS ALONG THE SLIPPERY SIDES EMBRACED THE CARVED LEGS TRIED TO GET SOME CONCEPTION OF ITS SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE SPACE IT OCCUPIED IN PRIMEVAL NIGHT
1926-147979-0031 IT WAS COLD AND HARD AND LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN HIS BLACK UNIVERSE HE WENT BACK TO ITS MOUTH BEGAN AT ONE END OF THE KEYBOARD AND FELT HIS WAY DOWN INTO THE MELLOW THUNDER AS FAR AS HE COULD GO
1926-147979-0032 HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT MUST BE DONE WITH THE FINGERS NOT WITH THE FISTS OR THE FEET HE APPROACHED THIS HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL INSTRUMENT THROUGH A MERE INSTINCT AND COUPLED HIMSELF TO IT AS IF HE KNEW IT WAS TO PIECE HIM OUT AND MAKE A WHOLE CREATURE OF HIM
1926-147979-0033 THAT LAY UNDER THE BONES OF HIS PINCHED CONICAL LITTLE SKULL DEFINITE AS ANIMAL DESIRES THE DOOR OPENED MISS NELLIE AND HER MUSIC MASTER STOOD BEHIND IT BUT BLIND SAMSON WHO WAS SO SENSITIVE TO PRESENCES DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE THERE
1926-147979-0034 HE WAS FEELING OUT THE PATTERN THAT LAY ALL READY MADE ON THE BIG AND LITTLE KEYS WHEN HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE THE SOUND WAS WRONG AND HE WANTED ANOTHER MISS NELLIE SPOKE SOFTLY HE WHIRLED ABOUT IN A SPASM OF TERROR
1926-147979-0035 LEAPED FORWARD IN THE DARK STRUCK HIS HEAD ON THE OPEN WINDOW AND FELL SCREAMING AND BLEEDING TO THE FLOOR HE HAD WHAT HIS MOTHER CALLED A FIT THE DOCTOR CAME AND GAVE HIM OPIUM WHEN SAMSON WAS WELL AGAIN HIS YOUNG MISTRESS LED HIM BACK TO THE PIANO
1926-147979-0036 SEVERAL TEACHERS EXPERIMENTED WITH HIM THEY FOUND HE HAD ABSOLUTE PITCH AND A REMARKABLE MEMORY AS A VERY YOUNG CHILD HE COULD REPEAT AFTER A FASHION ANY COMPOSITION THAT WAS PLAYED FOR HIM NO MATTER HOW MANY WRONG NOTES HE STRUCK HE NEVER LOST THE INTENTION OF A PASSAGE
1926-147979-0037 AS PIANO PLAYING IT WAS PERHAPS ABOMINABLE BUT AS MUSIC IT WAS SOMETHING REAL VITALIZED BY A SENSE OF RHYTHM THAT WAS STRONGER THAN HIS OTHER PHYSICAL SENSES THAT NOT ONLY FILLED HIS DARK MIND BUT WORRIED HIS BODY INCESSANTLY
1926-147979-0038 AND HE WERE GLOATING OVER THEM AND TRICKLING THEM THROUGH HIS YELLOW FINGERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRASHING WALTZ D'ARNAULT SUDDENLY BEGAN TO PLAY SOFTLY AND TURNING TO ONE OF THE MEN WHO STOOD BEHIND HIM WHISPERED
1926-147979-0039 SOMEBODY DANCING IN THERE HE JERKED HIS BULLET HEAD TOWARD THE DINING ROOM I HEAR LITTLE FEET GIRLS I SPECT ANSON KIRKPATRICK MOUNTED A CHAIR AND PEEPED OVER THE TRANSOM
1926-147979-0040 SPRINGING DOWN HE WRENCHED OPEN THE DOORS AND RAN OUT INTO THE DINING ROOM TINY AND LENA ANTONIA AND MARY DUSAK WERE WALTZING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR THEY SEPARATED AND FLED TOWARD THE KITCHEN GIGGLING KIRKPATRICK CAUGHT TINY BY THE ELBOWS

1926-147979-0046 AND ON HIS WATCH CASE DOUBTLESS ON HIS HEART TOO HE WAS AN AFFECTIONATE LITTLE MAN AND HE THOUGHT HIS WIFE A WONDERFUL WOMAN HE KNEW THAT WITHOUT HER HE WOULD HARDLY BE MORE THAN A CLERK IN SOME OTHER MAN'S HOTEL AT A WORD FROM KIRKPATRICK
1926-147979-0047 OVER THE PIANO AND BEGAN TO DRAW THE DANCE MUSIC OUT OF IT WHILE THE PERSPIRATION SHONE ON HIS SHORT WOOL AND ON HIS UPLIFTED FACE
1926-147979-0048 WHENEVER THE DANCERS PAUSED TO CHANGE PARTNERS OR TO CATCH BREATH HE WOULD BOOM OUT SOFTLY WHO'S THAT GOIN BACK ON ME ONE OF THESE CITY GENTLEMEN I BET NOW YOU GIRLS
1926-147979-0049 ANTONIA SEEMED FRIGHTENED AT FIRST
1926-147979-0050 TINY SODERBALL WAS TRIM AND SLENDER WITH LIVELY LITTLE FEET AND PRETTY ANKLES SHE WORE HER DRESSES VERY SHORT SHE WAS QUICKER IN SPEECH LIGHTER IN MOVEMENT AND MANNER THAN THE OTHER GIRLS MARY DUSAK WAS BROAD AND
1926-147979-0051 SHE LOOKED BOLD AND RESOURCEFUL AND UNSCRUPULOUS AND SHE WAS ALL OF THESE THEY WERE HANDSOME GIRLS HAD THE FRESH COLOR OF THEIR COUNTRY UP BRINGING AND IN THEIR EYES THAT BRILLIANCY WHICH IS CALLED BY NO METAPHOR ALAS
1926-147979-0052 THE LIGHT OF YOUTH D'ARNAULT PLAYED UNTIL HIS MANAGER CAME AND SHUT THE PIANO BEFORE HE LEFT US HE SHOWED US HIS GOLD WATCH WHICH STRUCK THE HOURS AND A TOPAZ RING GIVEN HIM BY SOME RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN WHO DELIGHTED IN NEGRO MELODIES
1926-147979-0053 AND HAD HEARD D'ARNAULT PLAY IN NEW ORLEANS AT LAST HE TAPPED HIS WAY UPSTAIRS AFTER BOWING TO EVERYBODY DOCILE AND HAPPY I WALKED HOME WITH ANTONIA WE WERE SO EXCITED THAT WE DREADED TO GO TO BED
1926-147987-0000 THE DAY AFTER THE CUTTERS LEFT ANTONIA CAME OVER TO SEE US GRANDMOTHER NOTICED THAT SHE SEEMED TROUBLED AND DISTRACTED YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND ANTONIA SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY
1926-147987-0001 SHE HESITATED AND THEN TOLD US HOW STRANGELY MISTER CUTTER HAD BEHAVED BEFORE HE WENT AWAY
1926-147987-0002 AS HE HAD JUST PUT A NEW YALE LOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR CUTTER HAD BEEN SO INSISTENT IN REGARD TO THESE DETAILS THAT NOW SHE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT STAYING THERE ALONE
1926-147987-0003 OR THE WAY HE LOOKED AT HER I FEEL AS IF HE IS UP TO SOME OF HIS TRICKS AGAIN
1926-147987-0004 GRANDMOTHER WAS APPREHENSIVE AT ONCE I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU TO STAY THERE FEELING THAT WAY I SUPPOSE IT WOULD N'T BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE PLACE ALONE EITHER
1926-147987-0005 MAYBE JIM WOULD BE WILLING TO GO OVER THERE AND SLEEP AND YOU COULD COME HERE NIGHTS I'D FEEL SAFER KNOWING YOU WERE UNDER MY OWN ROOF I GUESS JIM COULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR SILVER AND OLD USURY NOTES AS WELL AS YOU COULD
1926-147987-0006 ANTONIA TURNED TO ME EAGERLY OH WOULD YOU JIM
1926-147987-0007 THE THIRD NIGHT I SPENT AT THE CUTTERS I AWOKE SUDDENLY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD HEARD A DOOR OPEN AND SHUT EVERYTHING WAS STILL HOWEVER AND I MUST HAVE GONE TO SLEEP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
1926-147987-0008 I WAS ONLY HALF AWAKE BUT I DECIDED THAT HE MIGHT TAKE THE CUTTERS SILVER WHOEVER HE WAS
1926-147987-0009 I HELD MY BREATH AND LAY ABSOLUTELY STILL A HAND CLOSED SOFTLY ON MY SHOULDER AND AT THE SAME MOMENT I FELT SOMETHING HAIRY AND COLOGNE SCENTED BRUSHING MY FACE
1926-147987-0010 THE MAN BECAME INSANE HE STOOD OVER ME CHOKING ME WITH ONE FIST AND BEATING ME IN THE FACE WITH THE OTHER HISSING AND CHUCKLING AND LETTING OUT A FLOOD OF ABUSE SO THIS IS WHAT SHE'S UP TO WHEN I'M AWAY IS IT WHERE IS SHE YOU NASTY WHELP
1926-147987-0011 WHERE IS SHE UNDER THE BED ARE YOU HUSSY I KNOW YOUR TRICKS WAIT TILL I GET AT YOU I'LL FIX THIS RAT YOU'VE GOT IN HERE HE'S CAUGHT ALL RIGHT SO LONG AS CUTTER HAD ME BY THE THROAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR ME AT ALL
1926-147987-0012 WHEN I GOT HOME I CLIMBED IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW I WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM MY NOSE AND LIP BUT I WAS TOO SICK TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT I FOUND A SHAWL AND AN OVERCOAT ON THE HATRACK LAY DOWN ON THE PARLOR SOFA AND IN SPITE OF MY HURTS WENT TO SLEEP
1926-147987-0013 HER CRY OF FRIGHT AWAKENED ME TRULY I WAS A BATTERED OBJECT AS SHE HELPED ME TO MY ROOM I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MYSELF IN THE MIRROR MY LIP WAS CUT AND STOOD OUT LIKE A SNOUT MY NOSE LOOKED LIKE A BIG BLUE PLUM
1926-147987-0014 AND ONE EYE WAS SWOLLEN SHUT AND HIDEOUSLY DISCOLORED GRANDMOTHER SAID WE MUST HAVE THE DOCTOR AT ONCE BUT I IMPLORED HER AS I HAD NEVER BEGGED FOR ANYTHING BEFORE NOT TO SEND FOR HIM I COULD STAND ANYTHING I TOLD HER
1926-147987-0015 SHE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH I WAS TOO FAINT AND MISERABLE TO GO INTO EXPLANATIONS WHEN SHE TOOK
1926-147987-0016 SHE SPENT THE WHOLE MORNING BATHING AND POULTICING ME AND RUBBING ME WITH ARNICA I HEARD ANTONIA SOBBING OUTSIDE MY DOOR BUT I ASKED GRANDMOTHER TO SEND HER AWAY I FELT THAT I NEVER WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN
1926-147987-0017 SHE HAD LET ME IN FOR ALL THIS DISGUSTINGNESS GRANDMOTHER KEPT SAYING HOW THANKFUL WE OUGHT TO BE THAT I HAD BEEN THERE INSTEAD OF ANTONIA BUT I LAY WITH MY DISFIGURED FACE TO THE WALL AND FELT NO PARTICULAR GRATITUDE
1926-147987-0018 IF THE STORY ONCE GOT ABROAD I WOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT I COULD WELL IMAGINE WHAT THE OLD MEN DOWN AT THE DRUG STORE WOULD DO WITH SUCH A THEME
1926-147987-0019 AND HAD LEFT AGAIN ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR DENVER THAT MORNING THE AGENT SAID HIS FACE WAS STRIPED WITH COURT PLASTER AND HE CARRIED HIS LEFT HAND IN A SLING HE LOOKED SO USED UP THAT THE AGENT ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE TEN O'CLOCK THE NIGHT BEFORE
1926-147987-0020 MY OWN GARMENTS HAD BEEN TREATED SO BADLY THAT I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN GRANDMOTHER BURNED THEM IN THE CUTTERS KITCHEN RANGE WHILE ANTONIA WAS PACKING HER TRUNK AND PUTTING HER ROOM IN ORDER TO LEAVE IT THE FRONT DOOR BELL RANG VIOLENTLY
1926-147987-0021 THERE STOOD MISSUS CUTTER LOCKED OUT FOR SHE HAD NO KEY TO THE NEW LOCK HER HEAD TREMBLING WITH RAGE I ADVISED HER TO CONTROL HERSELF OR SHE WOULD HAVE A STROKE GRANDMOTHER SAID AFTERWARDS
1926-147987-0022 ANTONIA WAS FRIGHTENED AND WAS GOING HOME TO STAY FOR A WHILE SHE TOLD MISSUS CUTTER IT WOULD BE USELESS TO INTERROGATE THE GIRL FOR SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN MISSUS CUTTER TOLD HER STORY
1926-147987-0023 SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD STARTED HOME FROM OMAHA TOGETHER THE MORNING BEFORE THEY HAD TO STOP OVER SEVERAL HOURS AT WAYMORE JUNCTION TO CATCH THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN
1926-147987-0024 WHEN HE RETURNED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO STAY OVERNIGHT THERE
1926-147987-0025 SHE SAW HIM SLIP A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL INTO HER HANDBAG WITH HER TICKET THAT BILL SHE SAID SHOULD HAVE AROUSED HER SUSPICIONS AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THE TRAINS ARE NEVER CALLED AT LITTLE JUNCTION TOWNS EVERYBODY KNOWS WHEN THEY COME IN
1926-147987-0026 MISTER CUTTER SHOWED HIS WIFE'S TICKET TO THE CONDUCTOR AND SETTLED HER IN HER SEAT BEFORE THE TRAIN MOVED OFF
1926-147987-0027 AND THAT CUTTER MUST HAVE PLANNED IT SO THE CONDUCTOR TOLD HER THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN WAS DUE AT WAYMORE TWELVE MINUTES AFTER THE KANSAS CITY TRAIN LEFT SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD PLAYED THIS TRICK IN ORDER TO GET BACK TO BLACK HAWK WITHOUT HER
1926-147987-0028 SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO ON TO KANSAS CITY AND TAKE THE FIRST FAST TRAIN FOR HOME CUTTER COULD HAVE GOT HOME A DAY EARLIER THAN HIS WIFE BY ANY ONE OF A DOZEN SIMPLER DEVICES HE COULD HAVE LEFT HER IN THE OMAHA HOTEL
1926-147987-0029 BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS PART OF HIS FUN TO OUTRAGE HER FEELINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE MISTER CUTTER WILL PAY FOR THIS MISSUS BURDEN HE WILL PAY MISSUS CUTTER AVOUCHED NODDING HER HORSELIKE HEAD AND ROLLING HER EYES
1926-147987-0030 CERTAINLY CUTTER LIKED TO HAVE HIS WIFE THINK HIM A DEVIL IN SOME WAY HE DEPENDED UPON THE EXCITEMENT HE COULD AROUSE IN HER HYSTERICAL NATURE PERHAPS HE GOT THE FEELING OF BEING A RAKE MORE FROM HIS WIFE'S RAGE AND AMAZEMENT
1926-147987-0031 THAN FROM ANY EXPERIENCES OF HIS OWN HIS ZEST IN DEBAUCHERY MIGHT WANE BUT NEVER MISSUS CUTTER'S BELIEF IN IT THE RECKONING WITH HIS WIFE AT THE END OF AN ESCAPADE WAS SOMETHING HE COUNTED ON
8014-280382-0000 FLED TO LARS PORSENNA KING OF CLUSIUM AND BESOUGHT HIM THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM SUFFER NOT THEY SAID THAT WE WHO ARE TUSCANS BY BIRTH SHOULD REMAIN ANY MORE IN POVERTY AND EXILE
8014-280382-0001 AND TAKE HEED ALSO TO THYSELF AND THINE OWN KINGDOM IF THOU PERMIT THIS NEW FASHION OF DRIVING FORTH KINGS TO GO UNPUNISHED
8014-280382-0002 THAT IN FREEDOM WHICH MEN GREATLY DESIRE AND IF THEY THAT BE KINGS DEFEND NOT THEIR DIGNITY AS STOUTLY AS OTHERS SEEK TO OVERTHROW IT THEN SHALL THE HIGHEST BE MADE EVEN AS THE LOWEST AND THERE SHALL BE AN END OF KINGSHIP THAN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING MORE HONORABLE UNDER HEAVEN
8014-280382-0003 WITH THESE WORDS THEY PERSUADED KING PORSENNA WHO JUDGING IT WELL FOR THE ETRURIANS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A KING AT ROME AND THAT KING AN ETRURIAN BY BIRTH GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND CAME UP AGAINST ROME
8014-280382-0004 BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
8014-280382-0005 IN THE MEANWHILE I SO FAR AS ONE MAN MAY DO WILL STAY THE ENEMY AND AS HE SPAKE HE RAN FORWARD TO THE FARTHER END OF THE BRIDGE AND MADE READY TO KEEP THE WAY AGAINST THE ENEMY NEVERTHELESS THERE STOOD TWO WITH HIM
8014-280382-0006 LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS BY NAME MEN OF NOBLE BIRTH BOTH OF THEM AND OF GREAT RENOWN IN ARMS SO THESE THREE FOR A WHILE STAYED THE FIRST ONSET OF THE ENEMY AND THE MEN OF ROME MEANWHILE BRAKE DOWN THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS BUT A SMALL PART REMAINING
8014-280382-0007 AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
8014-280382-0008 KING PORSENNA TO ROB OTHERS OF THE FREEDOM THAT YE CARE NOT TO HAVE FOR YOURSELVES
8014-280382-0009 LOOKING EACH MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO SHOULD FIRST DEAL WITH THIS CHAMPION OF THE ROMANS THEN FOR VERY SHAME THEY ALL RAN FORWARD AND RAISING A GREAT SHOUT THREW THEIR JAVELINS AT HIM THESE ALL HE TOOK UPON HIS SHIELD NOR STOOD THE LESS FIRMLY IN HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE
8014-280382-0010 FOR THE BRIDGE WAS NOW ALTOGETHER BROKEN DOWN
8014-280382-0011 AND AS THE ENEMY STAYED A WHILE FOR FEAR HORATIUS TURNED HIM TO THE RIVER AND SAID O FATHER TIBER I BESEECH THEE THIS DAY WITH ALL REVERENCE THAT THOU KINDLY RECEIVE THIS SOLDIER AND HIS ARMS AND AS HE SPAKE HE LEAPT WITH ALL HIS ARMS INTO THE RIVER
8014-280382-0012 AND SWAM ACROSS TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THOUGH MANY JAVELINS OF THE ENEMY FELL ABOUT HIM HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT HURT NOR DID SUCH VALOR FAIL TO RECEIVE DUE HONOR FROM THE CITY
8014-112602-0000 AN OVAL FACE BROAD ABOVE AND NARROW BELOW GOLDEN HAIR FAIR SKIN WHITE DELICATE AND WELL FORMED HANDS WITH SLENDER TAPERING FINGERS THESE WERE CONSIDERED AS MARKING THE TYPE OF BEAUTY AND OF HIGH FAMILY DESCENT
8014-112602-0001 THEY WERE THE MARKS OF ARISTOCRACY TO THESE NATURAL ADVANTAGES THE PEOPLE ADDED BY THE USUAL ARTIFICIAL MEANS AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FINGER NAILS WERE KEPT CAREFULLY CUT AND ROUNDED
8014-112602-0002 IT WAS CONSIDERED SHAMEFUL FOR A MAN OF POSITION TO HAVE ROUGH UNKEMPT NAILS CRIMSON COLOURED FINGER NAILS WERE GREATLY ADMIRED
8014-112602-0003 I SLEEP NO MORE AND I SHALL NOT CRIMSON MY NAILS NO JOY SHALL EVER AGAIN COME UPON MY MIND
8014-112602-0004 LADIES OFTEN DYED THE EYEBROWS BLACK WITH THE JUICE OF SOME SORT OF BERRY
8014-112602-0005 THAT THE IRISH MISSIONARY MONKS SOMETIMES PAINTED OR DYED THEIR EYELIDS BLACK AN ENTRY IN CORMAC'S GLOSSARY PLAINLY INDICATES THAT THE BLUSH OF THE CHEEKS WAS SOMETIMES HEIGHTENED BY A COLOURING MATTER OBTAINED FROM THE ALDER TREE
8014-112602-0006 AND THE SPRIGS AND BERRIES OF THE ELDER WERE APPLIED TO THE SAME PURPOSE AMONG GREEK AND ROMAN LADIES THE PRACTICE WAS VERY GENERAL OF PAINTING THE CHEEKS EYEBROWS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FACE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WORE THE HAIR LONG
8014-112602-0007 THE HAIR WAS COMBED DAILY AFTER A BATH THE HEROES OF THE FENA OF ERIN BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO THEIR DINNER AFTER A HARD DAY'S HUNTING ALWAYS TOOK A BATH AND CAREFULLY COMBED THEIR LONG HAIR AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES IN VERY EARLY TIMES
8014-112602-0008 GREAT CARE WAS BESTOWED ON THE HAIR ITS REGULATION CONSTITUTED QUITE AN ART AND IT WAS DRESSED UP IN SEVERAL WAYS VERY OFTEN THE LONG HAIR OF MEN AS WELL AS OF WOMEN WAS ELABORATELY CURLED CONALL KERNACH'S HAIR AS DESCRIBED IN THE STORY OF DA DERGA
8014-112602-0009 FLOWED DOWN HIS BACK AND WAS DONE UP IN
8014-112602-0010 HOOKS AND PLAITS AND SWORDLETS
8014-112602-0011 THE ACCURACY OF THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS IS FULLY BORNE OUT BY THE MOST UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHORITY OF ALL NAMELY THE FIGURES IN THE EARLY ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AND ON THE SHRINES AND HIGH CROSSES OF LATER AGES
8014-112602-0012 IN NEARLY ALL THE FIGURES OF THE BOOK OF KELLS FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH CENTURY THE HAIR IS COMBED AND DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST CARE SO BEAUTIFULLY ADJUSTED INDEED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ONLY BY SKILLED PROFESSIONAL HAIRDRESSERS
8014-112602-0013 AND MUST HAVE OCCUPIED MUCH TIME WHETHER IN CASE OF MEN OR WOMEN
8014-112602-0014 AND IS COMMONLY DIVIDED THE WHOLE WAY AS WELL AS ALL OVER THE HEAD INTO SLENDER FILLETS OR LOCKS WHICH SOMETIMES HANG DOWN TO THE EYES IN FRONT I DO NOT FIND MENTIONED ANYWHERE THAT THE IRISH DYED THEIR HAIR AS WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG THE GREEKS AND ROMANS
8014-112602-0015 THE MEN WERE AS PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BEARD AS ABOUT THE HAIR THE FASHION OF WEARING THE BEARD VARIED
8014-112602-0016 AND GRADUALLY NARROWED TO TWO POINTS BELOW SOMETIMES AS SHOWN IN MANY ANCIENT FIGURES IT FALLS DOWN IN A SINGLE MASS WHILE IN A FEW IT IS CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AT BOTTOM NOT UNLIKE ASSYRIAN BEARDS NEARLY ALL HAVE A MUSTACHE
8014-112602-0017 IN MOST CASES CURLED UP AND POINTED AT THE ENDS AS WE OFTEN SEE NOW IN MANY THE BEARD IS CAREFULLY DIVIDED INTO SLENDER TWISTED FILLETS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE HAIR KINGS AND CHIEFS HAD BARBERS IN THEIR SERVICE TO ATTEND TO ALL THIS
8014-112602-0018 RAZORS WERE USED MADE OF BRONZE AS HARD AS STEEL AS WE KNOW BY FINDING THEM MENTIONED IN IRISH DOCUMENTS AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTH CENTURY AND MANY OLD BRONZE RAZORS ARE NOW PRESERVED IN MUSEUMS
8014-112602-0019 FROM WHAT PRECEDES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMBS WERE IN GENERAL USE WITH MEN AS WELL AS WITH WOMEN AND MANY SPECIMENS OF COMBS ARE NOW FOUND IN THE REMAINS OF ANCIENT DWELLINGS BATHING WAS VERY USUAL AT LEAST AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES
8014-112602-0020 AND BATHS AND THE USE OF BATHS ARE CONSTANTLY MENTIONED IN THE OLD TALES AND OTHER WRITINGS IN EVERY PUBLIC HOSTEL IN EVERY MONASTERY AND IN EVERY HIGH CLASS HOUSE THERE WAS A BATH WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS SOAP WAS USED BOTH IN BATHING AND WASHING
8014-112602-0021 THE MODES OF MANUFACTURING THEM WILL BE MENTIONED SILK AND SATIN WHICH WERE OF COURSE IMPORTED WERE MUCH WORN AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FURS OF ANIMALS SUCH AS SEALS OTTERS BADGERS FOXES ET CETERA WERE MUCH USED FOR CAPES AND JACKETS
8014-112602-0022 AND FOR THE EDGINGS OF VARIOUS GARMENTS SO THAT SKINS OF ALL THE VARIOUS KINDS WERE VALUABLE THEY FORMED TOO AN IMPORTANT ITEM OF EVERYDAY TRAFFIC AND THEY WERE ALSO EXPORTED THE ANCIENT IRISH LOVED BRIGHT COLOURS
8014-112602-0023 IN THIS RESPECT THEY RESEMBLED MANY OTHER NATIONS OF ANTIQUITY AS WELL INDEED AS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THEY ILLUSTRATED RUSKIN'S SAYING
8014-112602-0024 WHENEVER MEN ARE NOBLE THEY LOVE BRIGHT COLOUR
8014-112602-0025 IN SKY SEA FLOWERS
8014-112602-0026 AND WE KNOW THAT THEY WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF DYEING THE SEVERAL ARTICLES OF DRESS ON ONE PERSON WERE USUALLY COLOURED DIFFERENTLY EVEN THE SINGLE OUTER CLOAK WAS OFTEN STRIPED SPOTTED OR CHEQUERED IN VARIOUS COLOURS KING DOMNALL IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY
8014-112602-0027 ON ONE OCCASION SENT A MANY COLOURED TUNIC TO HIS FOSTER SON PRINCE CONGAL LIKE JOSEPH'S COAT OF MANY COLOURS A VERY COMMON ARTICLE OF DRESS WAS A LARGE CLOAK GENERALLY WITHOUT SLEEVES
8014-112602-0028 VARYING IN LENGTH BUT COMMONLY COVERING THE WHOLE PERSON FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE PEOPLE ALSO WORE A TIGHT FITTING COAT WITH SLEEVES
8014-112602-0029 BUT IT WAS MUCH SHORTER AND WITHOUT A COLLAR
8014-112602-0030 A SHORT CAPE WAS OFTEN WORN ON THE SHOULDERS SOMETIMES CARRYING A HOOD TO COVER THE HEAD THE OUTER COVERING OF THE GENERAL RUN OF THE PEASANTRY WAS JUST ONE LOOSE SLEEVED COAT OR MANTLE
8014-112602-0031 WHICH COVERED THEM DOWN TO THE ANKLES AND WHICH THEY WORE WINTER AND SUMMER WOMEN COMMONLY WORE A LONG LOOSE CLOAK WITH A HOOD A FASHION WHICH IS COMMON AT THE PRESENT DAY THE OVER GARMENTS WERE FASTENED BY BROOCHES PINS BUTTONS
8014-112602-0032 GIRDLES STRINGS AND LOOPS MANY OF THEM BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND ORNAMENTED THE ANCIENT IRISH WORE A TROUSERS WHICH WAS SO TIGHT FITTING AS TO SHOW PERFECTLY THE SHAPE OF THE LIMBS WHEN TERMINATING BELOW THE ANKLES IT WAS HELD DOWN BY A SLENDER STRAP PASSING UNDER THE FOOT
8014-112602-0033 LIKE OTHER IRISH GARMENTS IT WAS GENERALLY STRIPED OR SPECKLED IN VARIOUS COLOURS LEGGINGS OF CLOTH OR OF THIN SOFT LEATHER WERE USED AND WERE LACED ON BY STRINGS TIPPED WITH WHITE BRONZE
8014-112602-0034 A KILT WAS OFTEN WORN IN WHICH CASE THE LEGS WERE LEFT BARE AT THE KNEES WITH LEGGINGS BELOW FOR THE KILT IS OF IRISH ORIGIN AND WAS BROUGHT LIKE MANY OTHER FASHIONS BY THE EARLY COLONISTS TO SCOTLAND
8014-112602-0035 AND WHEN NOT ACTUALLY WORN WAS USUALLY CARRIED AMONG OTHER SMALL ARTICLES IN A LADY'S ORNAMENTAL HAND BAG SHOES WERE OFTEN MADE OF UNTANNED HIDE STITCHED WITH THONGS WITH SEVERAL LAYERS FOR A SOLE BUT THERE WAS A MORE SHAPELY SHOE MADE OF FULLY TANNED LEATHER
8014-112602-0036 HAVING SERVICEABLE SOLE AND HEEL AND OFTEN ORNAMENTED WITH PATTERNS STAMPED IN THE IRISH WERE EXCESSIVELY FOND OF PERSONAL ORNAMENTS WHICH AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES WERE MADE OF EXPENSIVE MATERIALS SUCH AS GOLD SILVER GEMS WHITE BRONZE ET CETERA
8014-112602-0037 THEY WORE RINGS AND BRACELETS OF VARIOUS SHAPES ON THE FINGERS INCLUDING THE THUMB ROUND THE WRIST AND FOREARM AND EVEN ROUND THE LEG ABOVE THE ANKLE
8014-112602-0038 ALL OF WHICH MATERIALS WERE FOUND NATIVE THEY HAD TORQUES FOR THE NECK MADE OF TWISTED GOLD BARS AND THE ELABORATE AND IMMENSELY EXPENSIVE CRESCENTS OR GORGETS
8014-112602-0039 THERE WAS A GOLD ORNAMENT A KIND OF OPEN RING WITH BOSSES OR BUTTONS ON THE ENDS
8014-112602-0040 WORN ON THE BREAST SUSPENDED FROM AN ORNAMENTED BUTTON THIN CIRCULAR GOLD PLATES WERE ALSO WORN FASTENED ON THE BREAST AND AS FOR BROOCHES THEY WERE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES SOME PLAIN SIMPLE AND CHEAP
8014-112602-0041 SOME OF GOLD OR OTHER EXPENSIVE MATERIAL OF ELABORATE WORKMANSHIP
8629-261140-0000 AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE SO THIS CROWD YIELDED TO ITS AWE AND MAN BY MAN SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT TILL QUIET WAS AGAIN RESTORED AND ONLY A CIRCLE OF LISTENING FACES CONFRONTED THE MAN WHO HAD JUST STIRRED A WHOLE ROOMFUL TO ITS DEPTHS
8629-261140-0001 SEEING THIS AND REALISING HIS OPPORTUNITY FREDERICK AT ONCE ENTERED INTO THE EXPLANATIONS FOR WHICH EACH HEART THERE PANTED THIS WILL BE OVERWHELMING NEWS TO HIM WHO HAS CARED FOR ME SINCE INFANCY
8629-261140-0002 YOU HAVE HEARD HIM CALL ME SON WITH WHAT WORDS SHALL I OVERTHROW HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH AND RECTITUDE OF HIS LONG BURIED WIFE AND MAKE HIM KNOW IN HIS OLD AGE THAT HE HAS WASTED YEARS OF PATIENCE UPON ONE WHO WAS NOT OF HIS BLOOD
8629-261140-0003 OR LINEAGE THE WONDER THE INCREDULITY YOU MANIFEST ARE MY BEST EXCUSE FOR MY LONG DELAY IN REVEALING THE SECRET ENTRUSTED TO ME BY THIS DYING WOMAN AN AWED SILENCE GREETED THESE WORDS
8629-261140-0004 THE ASTOUNDING FACT WHICH I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU WAS MADE KNOWN BY MY MOTHER WITH THE DAGGER STILL PLUNGED IN HER BREAST SHE WOULD NOT LET ME DRAW IT OUT SHE KNEW THAT DEATH WOULD FOLLOW THAT ACT
8629-261140-0005 AND SHE PRIZED EVERY MOMENT REMAINING TO HER BECAUSE OF THE BLISS SHE ENJOYED OF SEEING
8629-261140-0006 THE LOVE THE PASSION
8629-261140-0007 TRANSFORMED ME IN AN INSTANT FROM A SELFISH BRUTE INTO A DEEPLY REPENTANT MAN I KNELT BEFORE HER IN ANGUISH I MADE HER FEEL THAT WICKED AS I HAD BEEN I WAS NOT
8629-261140-0008 AND WHEN I SAW BY HER CLEARING BROW AND PEACEFUL LOOK THAT I HAD FULLY PERSUADED HER OF THIS I LET HER SPEAK WHAT WORDS SHE WOULD AND TELL AS SHE WAS ABLE
8629-261140-0009 IT IS A SACRED STORY TO ME AND IF YOU MUST KNOW IT LET IT BE FROM HER OWN WORDS IN THE LETTERS SHE LEFT BEHIND HER SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT TO SAVE ME FROM THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD PRECEDED ME
8629-261140-0010 AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO DECEIVE MISTER SUTHERLAND CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN I WAS NOT HIS OWN CHILD
8629-261140-0011 SHE ENJOINED ME NOT TO ENLIGHTEN HIM NOW IF BY ANY SACRIFICE ON MY PART I COULD RIGHTFULLY AVOID IT THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN HAVING ME HEAR THE TRUTH BEFORE SHE DIED THAT THE JOY WHICH THIS GAVE HER WAS SO GREAT
8629-261140-0012 SHE DID NOT REGRET HER FATAL ACT VIOLENT AND UNCALLED FOR AS IT WAS FOR IT HAD SHOWED HER MY HEART AND ALLOWED ME TO READ HERS
8629-261140-0013 AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD CARE FOR HIM TO THE LAST WITH TENDERNESS SAYING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT SEEMING IMPROPRIETY SINCE SHE HAD WILLED ME ALL HER FORTUNE UNDER THIS PROVISO FINALLY
8629-261140-0014 AND THOUGH HER STRENGTH AND BREATH WERE FAST FAILING HER SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE ZABELS WHO HAD NOT COME ACCORDING TO A SACRED CUSTOM BETWEEN THEM TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER WEDDING
8629-261140-0015 AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED
8629-261140-0016 SHE POINTED TO THE DAGGER IN HER BREAST BUT BEFORE I COULD LAY MY HAND UPON IT SHE CALLED FOR BATSY I WANT HER TO HEAR ME DECLARE BEFORE I GO SAID SHE THAT THIS STROKE WAS DELIVERED BY MYSELF UPON MYSELF
8629-261140-0017 BUT WHEN I ROSE TO LOOK FOR BATSY I FOUND THAT THE SHOCK OF HER MISTRESS'S FATAL ACT HAD KILLED HER
8629-261140-0018 IN CASE MY PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSE OF DEATH SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
8629-261140-0019 FOR FEAR IT WOULD MAKE HER LAST MOMENTS MISERABLE
8629-261140-0020 BUT WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO MOVE OR SPEAK AND THIS SATISFIED MY MOTHER AND MADE HER LAST BREATH ONE OF TRUST AND CONTENTED LOVE SHE DIED AS I DREW THE DAGGER FROM HER BREAST
8629-261140-0021 AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA
8629-261140-0022 JAMES ZABEL MUCH LESS THAT IT BORE HIS INITIALS ON THE HANDLE HE PAUSED AND THE AWE OCCASIONED BY THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS SO DEEP AND THE SILENCE SO PROLONGED THAT A SHUDDER PASSED OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
8629-261140-0023 WHEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN QUARTER A SINGLE CUTTING VOICE AROSE IN THIS ONE SHORT MOCKING COMMENT OH THE FAIRY TALE WAS IT AMABEL WHO SPOKE SOME THOUGHT SO AND LOOKED HER WAY
8629-261140-0024 AS IF BEGGING PARDON FOR THE WICKED DOUBTS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO THIS DEFENCE FREDERICK MET THAT LOOK WITH ONE SO SEVERE IT PARTOOK OF HARSHNESS THEN RESUMING HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID
8629-261140-0025 AND OF HOW ONE OF THEM JAMES BY NAME CAME TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR WHEN I LEFT MY DEAD MOTHER'S SIDE I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT I PASSED WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE THE ROOM WHERE MY NEW FOUND FATHER SAT SLEEPING
8629-261140-0026 BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
8629-261140-0027 BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN
8629-261140-0028 AND SEEING MY WAY PERFECTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM ON THE LEFT THE DOOR OF WHICH ALSO STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAD ENTERED UNANNOUNCED THAT NIGHT AND IN THIS AS IN THE OTHER
8629-261140-0029 I ENCOUNTERED A MAN SITTING ASLEEP BY THE TABLE IT WAS JOHN THE ELDER OF THE TWO AND PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR FOOD AND IN A CONDITION OF EXTREME MISERY I TOOK OUT THE FIRST BILL MY HAND ENCOUNTERED
8629-261140-0030 AS I DID SO HE GAVE A SIGH BUT DID NOT WAKE
8629-261140-0031 I HASTENED AWAY AND TOOK THE SHORTEST PATH HOME HAD I BEEN MORE OF A MAN OR IF MY VISIT TO MISSUS WEBB HAD BEEN ACTUATED BY A MORE COMMUNICABLE MOTIVE I WOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE TO THE GOOD MAN WHO BELIEVED ME TO BE OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
8629-261140-0032 AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
8629-261140-0033 IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF PLACED BUT THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND PAST INGRATITUDES TOGETHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHOCK WHICH HE COULD NOT FAIL TO RECEIVE ON LEARNING AT THIS LATE DAY
8629-261140-0034 WAS NEITHER OF HER BLOOD NOR HIS ROSE UP BETWEEN US AND CAUSED ME NOT ONLY TO ATTEMPT SILENCE BUT TO SECRETE IN THE ADJOINING WOODS THE MONEY I HAD RECEIVED IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT ALL VISIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY MOTHER'S TRAGIC DEATH
8629-261140-0035 WOULD THUS BE LOST YOU SEE I HAD NOT CALCULATED ON MISS AMABEL PAGE
8629-261140-0036 STARTLED THE CROWD AND GAVE SWEETWATER ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND WONDER
8629-261140-0037 AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES JUSTICE HAD ACTUATED AMABEL IN HER TREATMENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY OTHERS AND A REACTION SET IN IN FREDERICK'S FAVOUR WHICH EVEN AFFECTED THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY
8629-261140-0038 FREDERICK HIMSELF FELT THE CHANGE AND SHOWED IT BY THE LOOK OF RELIEF AND GROWING CONFIDENCE HE CAST AT AGNES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH NOW PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE JURY I NEED GIVE NO ACCOUNT
8629-261140-0039 THEY BUT EMPHASISED FACTS ALREADY KNOWN AND PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE GENERAL FEELING
8629-261140-0040 WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME HIS SEAT
8629-261140-0041 SHE ROSE WITH A BOUND NOUGHT THAT SHE HAD ANTICIPATED HAD OCCURRED FACTS OF WHICH SHE COULD KNOW NOTHING HAD CHANGED THE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS AND MADE THE POSITION OF FREDERICK SOMETHING SO REMOTE FROM ANY SHE COULD HAVE IMAGINED
8629-261140-0042 THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
8629-261140-0043 SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
8629-261140-0044 WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
8629-261140-0045 YET HOW THRILLING IT HAD BEEN TO HEAR HIM PLEAD HIS CAUSE SO WELL IT WAS ALMOST WORTH THE LOSS OF HER REVENGE TO MEET HIS LOOK OF HATE AND DREAM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF TURNING IT LATER INTO THE OLD LOOK OF LOVE YES YES SHE LOVED HIM NOW
8629-261140-0046 NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
8629-261140-0047 WITH SUCH FEELINGS
8629-261140-0048 HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
8629-261140-0049 SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS IN HER FORMER TESTIMONY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FLOWER WHOSE PRESENCE ON THE SCENE OF DEATH HAD BEEN SUCH A MYSTERY HAD FALLEN FROM HER HAIR AT THE BALL AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN FREDERICK PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
8629-261140-0050 BEYOND THIS AND THE INFERENCES IT AFTERWARD AWAKENED IN HER MIND SHE WOULD NOT GO
26-496-0000 IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
26-496-0001 FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
26-496-0002 OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
26-496-0003 BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
26-496-0004 YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
26-496-0005 AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
26-496-0006 AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
26-496-0007 AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
26-496-0008 THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
26-496-0009 WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
26-496-0010 MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
26-496-0011 IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
26-496-0012 AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
26-496-0013 THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
26-496-0014 BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
26-496-0015 BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
26-496-0016 AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
26-496-0017 AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
26-496-0018 A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
26-496-0019 AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
26-496-0020 AND IN THE SUBURBS IN SOUTHWARK AND IN THE EAST PART SUCH AS WAPPING RATCLIFF STEPNEY ROTHERHITHE AND THE LIKE THE PEOPLE GENERALLY STAYED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A FEW WEALTHY FAMILIES WHO AS ABOVE
26-496-0021 AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
26-496-0022 WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
26-496-0023 ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
26-496-0024 TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
26-496-0025 AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
26-496-0026 MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE

2196-174172-0034 THEY ARE NEARER THAN EVER LIFE AND LOVE NEVER CHANGE DEATH IS AN UNREALITY THOUGHT MADE
2196-174172-0035 THAT IS GLORIFIED IN LIFE AND SPIRIT WHEN YOU BELIEVE YOU WERE CREATED IN HIS IMAGE
2196-174172-0036 IT IS EASIER TO BELIEVE YOU SHALL ARISE IN HIS LIKENESS SOME DAY WE SHALL ALL BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT DISFIGURED MORALLY BROKEN NATURES BUT DIVINE NATURES SUPREME IN LIMITLESS POWER
2196-174172-0037 TRADITIONS TEACHINGS EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT OF GENERATIONS OF THINKING HAVE DISFIGURED MORALLY BROKEN SIN BURDENED HUMANITY ALL ARE THOUGHT CREATED CONDITIONS THOUGHT MADE LIMITATIONS

2196-170379-0000 IS TO EXPLORE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH ARE HELD BY LEADING AUTHORITIES AT PRESENT IT CAN BE SAID HOWEVER THAT A MAJORITY OF AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT HYPNOSIS ENSUES AS A RESULT OF NATURAL LAWS
2196-170379-0001 WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE HUMAN ORGANISM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN AS HE IS TODAY THE OLDER THEORIES SHOW ALMOST AS MUCH DISPARITY AS TODAY BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF HISTORY
2196-170379-0002 BOTH NAMES LOOM LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF HYPNOSIS MESMER AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PHYSICIAN BELIEVED THAT HYPNOSIS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF VITAL FLUIDS DRAWN FROM A MAGNET OR LODESTONE
2196-170379-0003 AND WHICH DREW THEIR UNIQUE QUALITIES FROM THE SUN MOON AND STARS CHARCOT
2196-170379-0004 WAS CONVINCED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A FORM OF HYSTERIA AND THAT ONLY HYSTERICS COULD BE HYPNOTIZED THE FORMER MESMER THOUGHT FURTHER THAT METAL BECAME IMBUED BY THE SOLAR QUALITIES AND HIS SYSTEM IS ALSO KNOWN AS METALOGY
2196-170379-0005 NOTABLY DOCTOR WILLIAM S KROGER A PSYCHIATRICALLY ORIENTED OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST WHO LIMITS HIS PRACTICE TO HYPNOTHERAPY BELIEVE HYPNOSIS IS A CONVICTION PHENOMENON WHICH PRODUCES RESULTS THAT PARALLEL THE PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0006 PRODUCED AT LOURDES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS HEALING SHRINES HIS FORMULA IS THAT FAITH HOPE BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ALL CATALYZED BY THE IMAGINATION LEAD INEVITABLY TO HYPNOSIS
2196-170379-0007 IS CONVINCED THAT YOU CANNOT WILL YOURSELF TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND THAT WHENEVER THE WILL AND THE IMAGINATION COME INTO CONFLICT
2196-170379-0008 THIS FITS IN PERFECTLY OF COURSE WITH THE AUTHOR'S ALREADY DISCUSSED VISUAL IMAGERY TECHNIQUE WHICH REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF IMAGINATION DOCTOR KROGER LIKE A FEW OTHERS HAS PROVED TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION THAT ALL HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0009 CAN BE PRODUCED AT A NON HYPNOTIC LEVEL A LARGE NUMBER OF HYPNOTISTS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HYPNOSIS IS A SEMANTIC PROBLEM IN WHICH WORDS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO SUCCESS NOT JUST ANY WORDS
2196-170379-0010 BUT WORDS WHICH RING A BELL OR TAP THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND OF THE SUBJECT
2196-170379-0011 THE WORD IS USED BECAUSE HYPNOSIS SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLES SLEEP INASMUCH AS THE EYES USUALLY ARE CLOSED THE BODY IN A POSTURE OF COMPLETE RELAXATION ACTUALLY THE MIND IS HYPERACUTE
2196-170379-0012 ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT A STRONG INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP IS NECESSARY FOR HYPNOSIS IN THE OPENING CHAPTER OF THE BOOK I EXPLAINED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A STATE OF HEIGHTENED SUGGESTION IN WHICH THE SUBJECT ADOPTED AN UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE
2196-170379-0013 ALLOWING HIM TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION THIS IS EXCELLENT AS FAR AS IT GOES BUT IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOW SUGGESTION WORKS THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE HYPNOTIC DILEMMA AND THE ANSWER IS FAR FROM SOLVED
2196-170379-0014 HYPNOTISTS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE WHO USE ELECTRICITY EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES BUT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY IT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO KNOW IT HAS BEEN HARNESSED FOR THEIR USE
2196-170379-0015 IF THERE IS ONE THING VIRTUALLY CERTAIN ABOUT HYPNOSIS IT IS THAT SOME PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE INHIBITED AND OTHER PARTS EXPANDED BY THE PROCESS
2196-170379-0016 BUT WHY IS THIS HIGH ORDER OF CONCENTRATION SO EASY UNDER HYPNOSIS WHEN ASIANS NOTABLY THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR CENTURIES TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE SUBJECT FOR AS LONG AS FOUR OR FIVE SECONDS
2196-170379-0017 WE DO NOT KNOW THE MECHANICS OF THIS METAMORPHOSIS OF AN ORDINARY BRAIN INTO AN ORGAN OF CONCENTRATED POWER ACCORDING TO JANET THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES
2196-170379-0018 WHICH TAKES OVER THE USUAL STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS TYPE OF THINKING IT IS IMPLIED THAT THE PROCESS MAY BE ATAVISTIC ONE OF THE NEWER THEORIES ONE HELD BY DOCTOR LEWIS R WOLBERG A PSYCHOANALYST
2196-170379-0019 AND A LIMITATION OF SENSORY CHANNELS SUCH AS TAKES PLACE IN SLEEP HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS OPERATES THROUGH TRANSFERENCE OTHERS AGREE THAT IT IS A TRANSFERENCE PROCESS
2196-170379-0020 BUT THAT IT IS MORE OF AN EXTENSION OF THE SUBJECT'S OWN PSYCHIC PROCESSES WHICH IS ENLARGED TO INCLUDE THE VOICE OF THE HYPNOTIST OR HIS OWN THOUGHTS OR VOICE INCIDENTALLY AN EXCELLENT BOOK ALONG THESE THEORETICAL LINES IS HYPNOTISM
2196-170379-0021 ACTUALLY HYPNOTISTS TODAY
2196-170379-0022 MILTON V KLINE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT LONG ISLAND UNIVERSITY POSTULATES THAT HYPNOSIS IS PRIMARILY RETROGRESSIVE HE HAS WRITTEN THAT THE ORGANISM FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY ON VARIOUS LEVELS OF BEHAVIOR REGRESSION
2196-170379-0023 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF REGRESSION ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT USED SO MUCH THESE DAYS TO UNCOVER PAST TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS ACTUALLY REGRESSION BY DUPLICATING THE EXACT EARLIER AGE
2196-170379-0024 MAKES US ONCE MORE AS LITTLE CHILDREN A CONDITION TO BE DESIRED FOR CERTAIN FORMS OF THERAPY AN ATAVISTIC THEORY HELD TO SOME EXTENT BY DOCTOR JEROME M SCHNECK CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
2196-170379-0025 STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IS THAT HYPNOSIS SHOULD BE EQUATED WITH STATES OF IMMOBILIZATION ON THE BASIS OF HIS OBSERVATION THAT SOME SUBJECTS EQUATE HYPNOSIS WITH DEATH
2196-170379-0026 OF ANIMALS TO AVOID DANGER OTHERS PRIMARILY EUROPEANS HAVE POINTED OUT THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE HYPNOTIC STATE OF ANIMALS AND MAN ANOTHER WIDELY HELD THEORY IS THAT HYPNOSIS IS A STATE OF DISSOCIATION
2196-170379-0027 MEANING THAT IT CONSTITUTES A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE DREDGED UP TO REPLACE THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AUTOMATICISM OF COURSE IS INHERENTLY PART OF THIS VIEW AND IS PRESUMED TO NEGATE VOLITION ACTIVITY OF THE CEREBRUM
2196-170379-0028 WHICH CONTROLS THE CONSCIOUS AND VOLUNTARY SYSTEM IS RENDERED NON OPERATIONAL MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE THAT HYPNOSIS RESULTS FROM FIRST OF ALL A GOOD TRANSFERENCE SECONDLY FROM A CONDITIONED REFLEX
2196-170379-0029 THIRDLY FROM THE PERSON ACTING AS A HYPNOTIZED PERSON ROLE PLAYING AND FOURTHLY FROM A SUSPENSION OF THE CRITICAL FACULTIES ALONG THE LAST NAMED LINE I BELIEVE THAT HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS
2196-170379-0030 WHICH SUPERSEDE ALL ELSE IN THE HYPNOTIC SITUATION THERE ARE MANY MORE THEORIES I BELIEVE ARE PARTIALLY CORRECT BUT THE ONES NAMED WILL DO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS VOLUME INCIDENTALLY
2196-170379-0031 ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO SELF HYPNOSIS EXCEPT WHERE AS IN TRANSFERENCE IT IS OBVIOUS A THERAPIST IS NEEDED IN CONCLUSION THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THOSE
2196-170379-0032 WHERE HYPNOTHERAPY IS IMPOSSIBLE LIKE THE MAN WHO CANNOT SLEEP BECAUSE OF AN ACTIVE MIND SLEEP AND MYRIAD THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND I BELIEVE ONCE A HYPNOTIC STATE HAS BEEN ATTAINED THAT THE SUBJECT IS KEPT AWAKE
2196-170379-0033 UNLESS DEFINITE SLEEP SUGGESTIONS ARE GIVEN BY THE THERAPIST'S SERIES OF SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE EFFECT OF THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND AT LENGTH AND SURELY NOTHING CONNOTATES SLEEP MORE THAN CLOSING ONE'S EYES
2196-170379-0034 AND SO IN MY VIEW
328-129766-0000 AND SO MIGHT MARRY AGAIN WHEN HE WOULD
328-129766-0001 AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
328-129766-0002 AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
328-129766-0003 WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
328-129766-0004 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0005 WHERE THOUGH IT WAS REMOTE FROM OUR PORT
328-129766-0006 THE ISLE OF BRITAIN I RESOLVED TO VENTURE IT NO MORE UPON THE WATERS WHICH HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE TO ME SO GETTING MY CLOTHES AND MONEY ON SHORE WITH MY BILLS OF LOADING AND OTHER PAPERS I RESOLVED TO COME FOR LONDON
328-129766-0007 THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
328-129766-0008 THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0010 I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
328-129766-0011 THAT SET ME UP FORMERLY FOR A FORTUNE SHE WAS DEAD AND HER HUSBAND ALSO AS I WAS INFORMED UPON SENDING A PERSON UNKNOWN TO INQUIRE THE LOOKING AFTER MY CARGO OF GOODS SOON AFTER OBLIGED ME TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO BRISTOL AND DURING MY ATTENDANCE UPON THAT AFFAIR
328-129766-0012 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0013 AS HAD BEEN MY CASE BEFORE THE BATH IS A PLACE OF GALLANTRY ENOUGH EXPENSIVE AND FULL OF SNARES I WENT THITHER INDEED
328-129766-0014 BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
328-129766-0015 AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0017 HOWEVER I SHOOK THEM OFF
328-129766-0018 BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
328-129766-0019 WHERE MEN FIND A MISTRESS SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY LOOK FOR A WIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES A WOMAN CAN EXPECT TO MAKE THERE MUST HAVE SOME TENDENCY THAT WAY I HAD SPENT THE FIRST SEASON WELL ENOUGH
328-129766-0020 FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
328-129766-0021 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0022 I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
328-129766-0023 AS NOT TO GET THE LEAST SLUR UPON MY REPUTATION ON ANY ACCOUNT WHATEVER AND ALL THE MEN THAT I HAD CONVERSED WITH WERE OF SO GOOD REPUTATION THAT I HAD NOT GIVEN THE LEAST REFLECTION BY CONVERSING WITH THEM
328-129766-0024 FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
328-129766-0025 THERE WAS NO MORE IN IT I HAD MANY MELANCHOLY HOURS AT THE BATH AFTER THE COMPANY WAS GONE
328-129766-0026 AND FOR RECRUITS OF MONEY YET I CHOSE TO COME BACK TO BATH FOR MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE BEING ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED IN THE SUMMER I FOUND THAT DURING THE WINTER I LIVED RATHER CHEAPER THERE
328-129766-0027 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0029 AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0031 AND THAT MY BROTHER CORRESPONDED CHIEFLY AT BRISTOL I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR MY RETURNS THAN TO GO TO LONDON WHERE ALSO I HAD NOT THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE MY NEW FRIEND APPEARED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH MY CONDITION
328-129766-0032 AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
328-129766-0033 TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
328-129766-0034 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0035 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
328-129766-0036 IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0038 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0039 OF HER OWN RELATIONS WHICH HE CONSENTED TO TO AVOID ANY REFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT AS WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN SUCH CASES BE CAST ON HIM FOR MISMANAGING HER CURE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE CAME TO THE BATH TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS
328-129766-0040 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0041 AS A MAN OF HONOUR AND OF VIRTUE AS WELL AS OF GREAT ESTATE AND INDEED I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO SAY SO OF HIM TOO FOR THOUGH WE LODGED BOTH ON A FLOOR AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY COME INTO MY CHAMBER EVEN WHEN I WAS IN BED
328-129766-0042 AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
328-129766-0043 AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
328-129766-0044 I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
328-129766-0045 AND SHE DID SO AND MANAGED IT SO DEXTEROUSLY
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0047 WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
328-129766-0048 IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
328-129766-0049 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0050 AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
328-129766-0051 THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
328-129766-0052 MAKES A STORY OF HER OWN INVENTING AND COMES IN
328-129766-0053 OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0055 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0056 SAID I FOR I ASSURE YOU HE BROUGHT ME ALL THE MONEY I SENT HIM FOR AND HERE IT IS SAID I PULLING OUT MY PURSE WITH ABOUT TWELVE GUINEAS IN IT AND ADDED I INTEND YOU SHALL HAVE MOST OF IT BY AND BY HE SEEMED DISTASTED A LITTLE AT HER TALKING
328-129766-0057 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0059 BUT I SUPPOSED SHE WANTED WHAT I OWED HER WHICH WAS ABOUT EIGHT GUINEAS WHICH I HAD RESOLVED TO GIVE HER AND HAD ACCORDINGLY
328-129766-0060 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0062 AT THE WORD SINCERE AND ASKING HIM IF I HAD EVER GIVEN HIM ANY ANSWERS WHICH WERE NOT SINCERE I PROMISED HIM I WOULD WHY THEN HIS REQUEST WAS HE SAID TO LET HIM SEE MY PURSE
328-129766-0063 I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
328-129766-0064 NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
328-129766-0065 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0066 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0068 WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
328-129766-0069 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0070 AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
328-129766-0071 FOR I LOVED NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES I TOLD HIM I MUST HOUSEWIFE THE MONEY HE HAD LENT ME OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY HIM AGAIN HE THEN TOLD ME IN A FEW WORDS THAT AS HE HAD A SINCERE RESPECT FOR ME AND KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0074 THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
328-129766-0075 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0076 CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
328-129766-0077 HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
328-129766-0078 IN A LITTER TO THE BATH WHERE THERE WAS MORE HELP AND BETTER ADVICE TO BE HAD HE CONSENTED AND I BROUGHT HIM TO THE BATH WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES AS I REMEMBER HERE HE CONTINUED VERY ILL OF A FEVER
328-129766-0079 AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
328-129766-0080 INDEED IF I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE I SAT UP WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT AT LAST INDEED HE WOULD NOT LET ME SIT UP ANY LONGER AND THEN I GOT A PALLET BED INTO HIS ROOM AND LAY IN IT JUST AT HIS BED'S FEET
328-129766-0081 I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
328-129766-0082 HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
328-129766-0083 AS IT IS APPARENT I HAVE DONE IN OTHER CASES IN THIS ACCOUNT BUT I AFFIRM THAT THROUGH ALL THIS CONVERSATION ABATING THE FREEDOM OF COMING INTO THE CHAMBER WHEN I OR HE WAS IN BED AND ABATING THE NECESSARY OFFICES
328-129766-0084 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0087 BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
328-129766-0088 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0089 WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
328-129766-0090 TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
328-129766-0091 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0092 WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0094 HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
328-129766-0095 IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
328-129766-0096 OTHER THAN EMBRACING ME AS I SAY IN HIS ARMS NO NOT THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT ROSE UP AND DRESSED HIM IN THE MORNING AND LEFT ME AS INNOCENT FOR HIM AS I WAS THE DAY I WAS BORN THIS WAS A SURPRISING THING TO ME
328-129766-0097 AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
328-129766-0098 THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
4018-107312-0000 THE CHIEF STREET OF MOWBRAY CALLED CASTLE STREET AFTER THE RUINS OF THE OLD BARONIAL STRONGHOLD IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS AS SIGNIFICANT OF THE PRESENT CIVILIZATION OF THIS COMMUNITY AS THE HAUGHTY KEEP HAD BEEN OF ITS ANCIENT DEPENDENCE
4018-107312-0001 THE DIMENSIONS OF CASTLE STREET WERE NOT UNWORTHY OF THE METROPOLIS IT TRAVERSED A GREAT PORTION OF THE TOWN AND WAS PROPORTIONATELY WIDE ITS BROAD PAVEMENTS AND ITS BLAZING GAS LIGHTS INDICATED ITS MODERN ORDER AND PROSPERITY

4018-107338-0000 MORLEY PAUSED AS HE RECOGNISED EGREMONT THEN ADVANCING TO GERARD FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION HE SAID THIS IS MISTER HATTON OF WHOM WE WERE SPEAKING LAST NIGHT AND WHO CLAIMS TO BE AN ANCIENT ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS
4018-107338-0001 PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY OF YOUR POOR DEAR FATHER SAID HATTON SCANNING GERARD WITH HIS CLEAR BLUE EYE AND THEN HE ADDED HE WAS OF GREAT SERVICE TO ME IN MY YOUTH AND ONE IS NOT APT TO FORGET SUCH THINGS
4018-107338-0002 AND I VENTURE TO BELIEVE MY PRAYERS AND VIGILS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED
4018-107338-0003 AND AS HE WAS SPEAKING THESE WORDS HE TURNED AND ADDRESSED THEM TO SYBIL SHE BEHELD HIM WITH NO LITTLE INTEREST THIS MYSTERIOUS NAME THAT HAD SOUNDED SO OFTEN IN HER YOUNG EARS
4018-107338-0004 AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SO MANY STRANGE AND HIGH HOPES AND SOME DARK BLENDING OF DOUBT AND APPREHENSION AND DISCORDANT THOUGHTS HATTON IN HIS APPEARANCE REALISED LITTLE OF THE FANCIES
4018-107338-0005 THAT APPEARANCE WAS PREPOSSESSING A FRANK AND EVEN BENEVOLENT EXPRESSION PLAYED UPON HIS INTELLIGENT AND HANDSOME COUNTENANCE HIS ONCE RICH BROWN HAIR STILL LONG THOUGH VERY THIN
4018-107338-0006 DETRACT FROM THE FAVOURABLE EFFECT THAT HE ALWAYS AT ONCE PRODUCED
4018-107338-0007 IS THE PRIVILEGE OF THE PEOPLE OF WHOM I AM ONE SAID HATTON BOWING WELL RECOLLECTING THAT HE WAS ADDRESSING THE DAUGHTER OF A CHARTIST DELEGATE BUT IS YOUR LABOUR THEIR LABOUR SAID SYBIL
4018-107338-0008 IS YOURS THAT LIFE OF UNCOMPLAINING TOIL WHEREIN THERE IS SO MUCH OF BEAUTY AND OF GOODNESS THAT BY THE FINE MAXIM OF OUR CHURCH IT IS HELD TO INCLUDE THE FORCE AND EFFICACY OF PRAYER
4018-107338-0009 THEN HESITATING WHILE A SOFT EXPRESSION CAME OVER HER COUNTENANCE SHE HELD FORTH HER HAND WHICH HE RETAINED FOR A MOMENT AND WITHDREW I WAS WITH HIM MORE THAN AN HOUR CONTINUED MORLEY AT FIRST HE RECOLLECTED NOTHING
4018-107338-0010 HE DOUBTLESS HAD THEM NOW AS HE NEVER DESTROYED PAPERS WOULD ORDER A SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR THEM AND SO ON I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW WHEN HE ASKED ME CARELESSLY A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR FATHER WHAT HE WAS DOING AND WHETHER HE WERE MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN
4018-107338-0011 THIS LED TO A VERY LONG CONVERSATION IN WHICH HE SUDDENLY SEEMED TO TAKE GREAT INTEREST AT FIRST HE TALKED OF WRITING TO SEE YOUR FATHER AND I OFFERED THAT GERARD SHOULD CALL UPON HIM
4018-107338-0012 HE TOOK DOWN YOUR DIRECTION IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT WRITE TO YOUR FATHER AND GIVE HIM AN APPOINTMENT WHEN OBSERVING THAT IT WAS WESTMINSTER HE SAID THAT HIS CARRIAGE WAS ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THAT IF NOT INCONVENIENT TO ME
4018-107338-0013 HE WOULD PROPOSE THAT I SHOULD AT ONCE ACCOMPANY HIM I THOUGHT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE RESULT IT MUST BE A SATISFACTION TO GERARD AT LAST TO SEE THIS MAN OF WHOM HE HAS TALKED AND THOUGHT SO MUCH AND SO WE ARE HERE
4018-107338-0014 YOU DID WELL GOOD STEPHEN AS YOU ALWAYS DO SAID SYBIL WITH A MUSING AND ABSTRACTED AIR NO ONE HAS SO MUCH FORETHOUGHT AND SO MUCH ENERGY AS YOU HE THREW A GLANCE AT HER AND IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW IT THEIR EYES HAD MET

4018-107338-0016 THE MYSTIFICATION OF WHICH WE HAD BEEN DUPES AND YOU DID WRONG SAID SYBIL THERE IS NO WISDOM LIKE FRANKNESS HAD YOU TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY HE MET AND ADDRESSED ME AND I ONLY RECOGNISED AN ACQUAINTANCE
4018-107338-0017 HAD HE NOT ACCOMPANIED ME TO THIS DOOR AND MET MY FATHER WHICH PRECIPITATED AN EXPLANATION ON HIS PART WHICH HE FOUND HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN BY OTHERS I MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN AN IGNORANCE WHICH HEREAFTER MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED INCONVENIENCE
4018-107338-0018 YOU ARE RIGHT SAID MORLEY LOOKING AT HER RATHER KEENLY WE HAVE ALL OF US OPENED OURSELVES TOO UNRESERVEDLY BEFORE THIS ARISTOCRAT I SHOULD HOPE THAT NONE OF US HAVE SAID TO HIM A WORD THAT WE WISH TO BE FORGOTTEN SAID SYBIL
4018-107338-0019 HE CHOSE TO WEAR A DISGUISE AND CAN HARDLY QUARREL WITH THE FRANKNESS WITH WHICH WE SPOKE OF HIS ORDER OR HIS FAMILY AND FOR THE REST HE HAS NOT BEEN INJURED FROM LEARNING SOMETHING OF THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE BY LIVING AMONG THEM
4018-107338-0020 AND YET IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO MORROW SAID MORLEY REST ASSURED THIS MAN HAS HIS EYE ON US HE CAN WALK INTO THE GOVERNMENT OFFICES LIKE THEMSELVES AND TELL HIS TALE FOR THOUGH ONE OF THE PSEUDO OPPOSITION THE MOMENT THE PEOPLE MOVE
4018-107338-0021 THE FACTIONS BECOME UNITED SYBIL TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN SAID AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO MORROW THAT WE SHOULD CARE FOR THE GOVERNMENT BEING ACQUAINTED WITH IT OR US DO NOT THEY KNOW EVERYTHING DO NOT YOU MEET IN THEIR VERY SIGHT
4018-107338-0022 YOU PURSUE AN AVOWED AND LEGAL AIM BY LEGAL MEANS DO YOU NOT WHAT THEN IS THERE TO FEAR AND WHY SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN THAT SHOULD MAKE US APPREHENSIVE ALL IS VERY WELL AT THIS MOMENT SAID MORLEY AND ALL MAY CONTINUE WELL
4018-107338-0023 BUT POPULAR ASSEMBLIES BREED TURBULENT SPIRITS SYBIL YOUR FATHER TAKES A LEADING PART HE IS A GREAT ORATOR AND IS IN HIS ELEMENT IN THIS CLAMOROUS AND FIERY LIFE IT DOES NOT MUCH SUIT ME I AM A MAN OF THE CLOSET
4018-107338-0024 MORLEY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN SAID AN EASY QUESTION QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS EASY THE FACT IS IN ACTIVE LIFE ONE CANNOT AFFORD TO REFINE I COULD HAVE WISHED THE MOVEMENT TO HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT SHAPE
4018-107338-0025 LAWFULLY MEETING IN OPEN DAY AND THEIR DELEGATES FROM THE WHOLE REALM DECLARING THEIR GRIEVANCES IN LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD NOT DISGRACE THE CONQUERING RACE WHICH HAS IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO DEGRADE THEM
4018-107338-0026 THERE CAN BE OTHER THAN ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT A THOUSAND SAID MORLEY WE HAVE ALREADY AS MANY PARTIES AS IN SAINT STEPHEN'S ITSELF YOU TERRIFY ME SAID SYBIL I KNEW WE HAD FEARFUL ODDS TO COMBAT AGAINST
4018-107338-0027 MY VISIT TO THIS CITY ALONE HAS TAUGHT ME HOW STRONG ARE OUR ENEMIES BUT I BELIEVED THAT WE HAD ON OUR SIDE GOD AND TRUTH THEY KNOW NEITHER OF THEM IN THE NATIONAL CONVENTION SAID MORLEY
4018-107338-0028 THE FACTIONS AND THE FAILURES OF OUR OPPRESSORS AT THIS MOMENT GERARD AND HATTON WHO WERE SITTING IN THE REMOTE PART OF THE ROOM ROSE TOGETHER AND ADVANCED FORWARD AND THIS MOVEMENT INTERRUPTED THE CONVERSATION OF SYBIL AND MORLEY
4018-107338-0029 SAYING IN A VOICE WHICH COULD ONLY BE HEARD BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM HE ADDRESSED YOU UNDERSTAND I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT MYSELF OF YOUR MORAL RIGHT I BELIEVE ON EVERY PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE THAT MOWBRAY CASTLE IS AS MUCH YOURS

1963-147036-0032 TARLING STEPPED BACK HE SAW THE MALICIOUS LITTLE SMILE ON MILBURGH'S FACE AND COULD HAVE STRUCK HIM DOWN MISS RIDER DOES NOT WISH ME TO SEE WHAT IS IN THIS CASE HE SAID
1963-147036-0033 HERE IT WAS THE GIRL'S VOICE SURPRISINGLY CLEAR AND STEADY HER SHAKING HANDS HELD THE PAPER SHE HAD TAKEN FROM THE WALLET AND SHE THRUST IT TOWARD THE DETECTIVE THERE IS A REASON SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
1963-147036-0034 MILBURGH HAD GONE TOO FAR TARLING SAW HIS FACE LENGTHEN AND THE LOOK OF APPREHENSION IN HIS COLD BLUE EYES THEN WITHOUT FURTHER HESITATION HE OPENED THE PAPER AND READ THE FIRST LINE TOOK AWAY HIS BREATH THE CONFESSION OF ODETTE RIDER
1963-147036-0035 GOOD GOD HE MUTTERED AND READ ON
7794-295955-0000 THEN THE MIDDLE SON WENT HUNTING AND AS HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN A HARE SPRANG OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT
7794-295955-0001 BUT IT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON WHICH WAITED FOR AND DEVOURED HIM WHEN SOME DAYS HAD ELAPSED AND THE PRINCES DID NOT RETURN EITHER OF THEM THE WHOLE COURT WAS IN SORROW
7794-295955-0002 THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0003 BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0004 SHE REPLIED MY SON THAT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON IT KILLS AND THROTTLES MANY PEOPLE HEARING THIS THE PRINCE WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW DOUBTLESS MY TWO BROTHERS ALSO HAVE PERISHED HERE
7794-295955-0005 THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
7794-295955-0006 THE OLD WOMAN INTERRUPTED HIM HOW SHOULD I NOT IT CAPTURED ME TOO IN THIS WAY BUT NOW I HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE THEN HE PROCEEDED LISTEN WELL TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU ASK IT WHITHER IT GOES AND WHERE ITS STRENGTH IS
7794-295955-0007 WHEN THE DRAGON CAME IN THE OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO QUESTION IT WHERE IN GOD'S NAME HAVE YOU BEEN WHITHER DO YOU GO SO FAR YOU WILL NEVER TELL ME WHITHER YOU GO THE DRAGON REPLIED WELL MY DEAR OLD WOMAN I DO GO FAR
7794-295955-0008 MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
7794-295955-0009 TOOK A SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE WORLD AS HE WENT ON THUS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN AT LAST HE CAME INTO ANOTHER EMPIRE AND INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY IN A LAKE UNDER WHICH THE DRAGON WAS
7794-295955-0010 ON GOING INTO THE TOWN HE BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHO WANTED A SHEPHERD THE CITIZENS TOLD HIM THAT THE EMPEROR DID THEN HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE EMPEROR AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF THE EMPEROR ADMITTED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND ASKED HIM
7794-295955-0011 AND WHEN YOU CALL THE SHEEP OUT THEY GO THITHER AT ONCE AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ROUND THE LAKE BUT WHATEVER SHEPHERD GOES OFF THERE THAT SHEPHERD RETURNS BACK NO MORE THEREFORE MY SON I TELL YOU
7794-295955-0012 DON'T LET THE SHEEP HAVE THEIR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE THEY WILL BUT KEEP THEM WHERE YOU WILL THE PRINCE THANKED THE EMPEROR GOT HIMSELF READY AND CALLED OUT THE SHEEP TAKING WITH HIM MORE OVER TWO HOUNDS THAT COULD CATCH A BOAR IN THE OPEN COUNTRY
7794-295955-0013 AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT DRAGON DRAGON COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME TO DAY
7794-295955-0014 LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
7794-295955-0015 BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
7794-295955-0016 AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0017 COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
7794-295955-0018 IT WAS DISGUSTING AND IT SEIZED HIM BY THE WAIST AND WRESTLED WITH HIM A SUMMER'S DAY TILL AFTERNOON BUT WHEN THE AFTERNOON HEAT CAME ON THE DRAGON SAID LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND MAY TOSS YOU TO THE SKY
7794-295955-0019 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
7794-295955-0020 THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
7794-295955-0021 AND I AM YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IF I PERISH THEN THE EMPEROR BEGAN TO PERSUADE AND ENCOURAGE HER DON'T FEAR MY DAUGHTER YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANGES OF SHEPHERDS AND OF ALL THAT WENT OUT TO THE LAKE NOT ONE HAS RETURNED
7794-295955-0022 SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN ON THE MORROW THE DAY DAWNED AND THE SUN CAME FORTH UP ROSE THE SHEPHERD UP ROSE THE MAIDEN TOO TO BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR GOING TO THE LAKE THE SHEPHERD WAS CHEERFUL MORE CHEERFUL THAN EVER
7794-295955-0023 BUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WAS SAD AND SHED TEARS THE SHEPHERD COMFORTED HER LADY SISTER I PRAY YOU DO NOT WEEP BUT DO WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN IT IS TIME RUN UP AND KISS ME AND FEAR NOT AS HE WENT AND DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0024 WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE LAKE THE SHEEP IMMEDIATELY SPREAD ROUND IT AND THE PRINCE PLACED THE FALCON ON THE STUMP AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE WATER AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0025 THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE SAID THIS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER RAN UP AND KISSED HIM ON THE FACE ON THE EYE AND ON THE FOREHEAD
7794-295955-0026 THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
7794-295955-0027 HOLD IT DON'T LET IT GO AND THE DOGS SPRANG UP AND AFTER IT CAUGHT IT AND SOON TORE IT TO PIECES BUT OUT OF THE BOAR FLEW A PIGEON AND THE PRINCE LOOSED THE FALCON AND THE FALCON CAUGHT THE PIGEON
7794-295955-0028 CUT THESE THREE WANDS UP FROM BELOW AND STRIKE WITH THEM UPON THEIR ROOT AN IRON DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN INTO A LARGE VAULT IN THAT VAULT ARE MANY PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG RICH AND POOR SMALL AND GREAT WIVES AND MAIDENS
7794-295955-0029 SO THAT YOU COULD SETTLE A POPULOUS EMPIRE THERE TOO ARE YOUR BROTHERS WHEN THE PIGEON HAD TOLD HIM ALL THIS THE PRINCE IMMEDIATELY WRUNG ITS NECK THE EMPEROR HAD GONE OUT IN PERSON
7794-295955-0030 HE WASHED HIMSELF NICELY TOOK THE FALCON ON HIS SHOULDER THE HOUNDS BEHIND HIM AND THE BAGPIPES UNDER HIS ARM PLAYED AS HE WENT DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0031 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOWN ALL THE TOWN ASSEMBLED AS TO SEE A WONDER THE EMPEROR WHO HAD SEEN ALL HIS HEROISM FROM THE HILL CALLED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO CHURCH HAD THEM MARRIED AND HELD A WEDDING FESTIVAL FOR A WEEK
7794-295948-0000 NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
7794-295948-0001 ALTHOUGH THE FAME OF HIS VIRTUE DID NOT REACH FAR YET HIS NEIGHBOURS RESPECTED AND REVERED HIM
7794-295948-0002 AND WHEN HIS ROOF OR HIS WALLS FELL OUT OF REPAIR THEY WOULD MEND THEM FOR HIM SO FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HE TOOK NO THOUGHT ONE VERY COLD NIGHT WHEN HE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS OUTSIDE HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
7794-295948-0003 YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
7794-295948-0004 BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
7794-295948-0005 WENT INTO THE HUT AND SQUATTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO WARM ITSELF AND THE PRIEST WITH RENEWED FERVOUR RECITED HIS PRAYERS AND STRUCK HIS BELL BEFORE THE IMAGE OF BUDDHA LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7794-295948-0006 AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
7794-295948-0007 THE PRIEST AT LAST BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH IT AND GOT USED TO ITS COMPANY SO THAT IF EVER AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BADGER DID NOT ARRIVE HE USED TO MISS IT AND WONDER WHY IT DID NOT COME
7794-295948-0008 AND EVEN AFTER MY DEATH I MUST REMEMBER THEM WHAT CAN I DO TO REQUITE THEM IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH FOR PRAY TELL ME THE PRIEST SMILING AT THIS SPEECH ANSWERED
7794-295948-0009 BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
7794-295948-0010 YOU SHALL BE WELCOME HERE THE BADGER ON HEARING THIS COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS ADMIRATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE OLD MAN'S BENEVOLENCE BUT HAVING SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IT FELT HURT AT NOT BEING ABLE TO REQUITE IT
7794-295948-0011 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
7794-295948-0012 YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
7794-295948-0013 THE SAME KIND FOLK HAVE PROMISED TO MEET AND BURY MY BODY THUS ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO OTHER REASON TO WISH FOR MONEY STILL IF I HAD THREE RIYOS I WOULD OFFER THEM UP AT SOME HOLY SHRINE THAT MASSES AND PRAYERS MIGHT BE SAID FOR ME
7794-295948-0014 WHEREBY I MIGHT ENTER INTO SALVATION YET I WOULD NOT GET THIS MONEY BY VIOLENT OR UNLAWFUL MEANS I ONLY THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE IF I HAD IT SO YOU SEE SINCE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SUCH KIND FEELINGS TOWARD ME
7794-295948-0015 I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
7794-295948-0016 AND TRIED TO RETRACT WHAT HE HAD SAID POSTHUMOUS HONOURS AFTER ALL ARE THE WISH OF ORDINARY MEN I WHO AM A PRIEST OUGHT NOT TO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS OR TO WANT MONEY SO PRAY PAY NO ATTENTION TO WHAT I HAVE SAID
7794-295948-0017 AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
7794-295948-0018 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0019 REPENTING WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT THE BADGER MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED HE PASSED HIS TIME IN PUTTING UP PRAYERS UPON PRAYERS FOR IT AFTER THREE YEARS HAD GONE BY ONE NIGHT
7794-295948-0020 THE OLD MAN HEARD A VOICE NEAR HIS DOOR CALLING OUT YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE AS THE VOICE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE BADGER HE JUMPED UP AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE BADGER
7794-295948-0021 IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
7794-295948-0022 FUSED IT AFRESH IN THE FIRE AND AT THIS WORK I SPENT MONTHS AND DAYS AS THE BADGER FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIEST LOOKED AT THE MONEY WHICH IT HAD PRODUCED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAW THAT IT WAS BRIGHT AND NEW AND CLEAN
7794-295948-0023 AS HE WAS THANKING THE BADGER WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY THE BEAST SAID IN DOING THIS I HAVE BUT FULFILLED MY OWN WISH STILL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THIS THING TO NO MAN INDEED REPLIED THE PRIEST
7794-295948-0024 BUT I SHALL SAY THAT THE BADGER THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY HAS CEASED COMING TO MY HUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING WAYLAID BUT CAN COME AS OF OLD AND SHELTER YOURSELF FROM THE COLD TO THIS THE BADGER NODDED ASSENT AND AS LONG AS THE OLD PRIEST LIVED
7794-295948-0025 IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
7794-295948-0026 WRITTEN IN THE ANNALS OF JAPAN
4898-28461-0000 THE MOST INTERESTING OF THE SHORT EXCURSIONS WE MADE FROM FORT WRANGELL WAS THE ONE UP THE STICKEEN RIVER TO THE HEAD OF STEAM NAVIGATION FROM MT SAINT ELIAS THE COAST RANGE EXTENDS IN A BROAD LOFTY CHAIN
4898-28461-0001 BEYOND THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE TERRITORY GASHED BY STUPENDOUS CANYONS
4898-28461-0002 THOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE COMPARATIVELY SHORT AS THEIR HIGHEST SOURCES LIE IN THE ICY SOLITUDES OF THE RANGE WITHIN FORTY OR FIFTY MILES OF THE COAST A FEW HOWEVER OF THESE FOAMING ROARING STREAMS
4898-28461-0003 TAKU STICKEEN AND PERHAPS OTHERS HEAD BEYOND THE RANGE WITH SOME OF THE SOUTHWEST BRANCHES OF THE MACKENZIE AND YUKON THE LARGEST SIDE BRANCHES
4898-28461-0004 ARE STILL OCCUPIED BY GLACIERS WHICH DESCEND IN SHOWY RANKS THEIR MESSY BULGING SNOUTS LYING BACK A LITTLE DISTANCE IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WALLS OR PUSHING FORWARD AMONG THE COTTON WOODS
4898-28461-0005 THAT LINE THE BANKS OF THE RIVERS OR EVEN STRETCHING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE MAIN CANYONS COMPELLING THE RIVERS TO FIND A CHANNEL BENEATH THEM THE STICKEEN WAS PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN OF THE RIVERS THAT CROSS THE COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0006 BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST WAY TO THE MACKENZIE RIVER CASSIAR GOLD MINES IT IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES LONG AND IS NAVIGABLE FOR SMALL STEAMERS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO GLENORA
4898-28461-0007 AND SOMETIMES TO TELEGRAPH CREEK FIFTEEN MILES FARTHER IT FIRST PURSUES A WESTERLY COURSE THROUGH GRASSY PLAINS DARKENED HERE AND THERE WITH GROVES OF SPRUCE AND PINE
4898-28461-0008 THEN CURVING SOUTHWARD AND RECEIVING NUMEROUS TRIBUTARIES FROM THE NORTH IT ENTERS THE COAST RANGE AND SWEEPS ACROSS IT THROUGH A MAGNIFICENT CANYON THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET DEEP
4898-28461-0009 OF FORM AND SCULPTURE AND ARE WONDERFULLY ADORNED AND ENLIVENED WITH GLACIERS AND WATERFALLS WHILE THROUGHOUT ALMOST ITS WHOLE EXTENT THE FLOOR IS A FLOWERY LANDSCAPE GARDEN LIKE YOSEMITE
4898-28461-0010 THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES ARE THE GLACIERS HANGING OVER THE CLIFFS DESCENDING THE SIDE CANYONS AND PUSHING FORWARD TO THE RIVER GREATLY ENHANCING THE WILD BEAUTY OF ALL THE OTHERS
4898-28461-0011 GLIDING ALONG THE SWIFT FLOWING RIVER THE VIEWS CHANGE WITH BEWILDERING RAPIDITY WONDERFUL TOO ARE THE CHANGES DEPENDENT ON THE SEASONS AND THE WEATHER IN SPRING WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST
4898-28461-0012 YOU ENJOY THE COUNTLESS REJOICING WATERFALLS THE GENTLE BREATHING OF WARM WINDS THE COLORS OF THE YOUNG LEAVES AND FLOWERS WHEN THE BEES ARE BUSY AND WAFTS OF FRAGRANCE ARE DRIFTING HITHER AND THITHER
4898-28461-0013 FROM MILES OF WILD ROSES CLOVER AND HONEYSUCKLE THE SWATHS OF BIRCH AND WILLOW ON THE LOWER SLOPES FOLLOWING THE MELTING OF THE WINTER AVALANCHE SNOW BANKS
4898-28461-0014 THE BOSSY CUMULI SWELLING IN WHITE AND PURPLE PILES ABOVE THE HIGHEST PEAKS GRAY RAIN CLOUDS WREATHING THE OUTSTANDING BROWS AND BATTLEMENTS OF THE WALLS
4898-28461-0015 AND THE BREAKING FORTH OF THE SUN AFTER THE RAIN THE SHINING OF THE LEAVES AND STREAMS AND CRYSTAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE GLACIERS THE RISING OF FRESH FRAGRANCE THE SONG OF THE HAPPY BIRDS
4898-28461-0016 AND THE SERENE COLOR GRANDEUR OF THE MORNING AND EVENING SKY IN SUMMER YOU FIND THE GROVES AND GARDENS IN FULL DRESS GLACIERS MELTING RAPIDLY UNDER SUNSHINE AND RAIN WATERFALLS IN ALL THEIR GLORY
4898-28461-0017 THE RIVER REJOICING IN ITS STRENGTH YOUNG BIRDS TRYING THEIR WINGS BEARS ENJOYING SALMON AND BERRIES ALL THE LIFE OF THE CANYON BRIMMING FULL LIKE THE STREAMS IN AUTUMN COMES REST AS IF THE YEAR'S WORK WERE DONE
4898-28461-0018 THE RICH HAZY SUNSHINE STREAMING OVER THE CLIFFS CALLS FORTH THE LAST OF THE GENTIANS AND GOLDENRODS THE GROVES AND THICKETS AND MEADOWS BLOOM AGAIN AS THEIR LEAVES CHANGE TO RED AND YELLOW PETALS
4898-28461-0019 THE ROCKS ALSO AND THE GLACIERS SEEM TO BLOOM LIKE THE PLANTS IN THE MELLOW GOLDEN LIGHT AND SO GOES THE SONG CHANGE SUCCEEDING CHANGE IN SUBLIME HARMONY THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL SEASONS AND WEATHER
4898-28461-0020 MY FIRST TRIP UP THE RIVER WAS MADE IN THE SPRING WITH THE MISSIONARY PARTY SOON AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT WRANGELL WE LEFT WRANGELL IN THE AFTERNOON AND ANCHORED FOR THE NIGHT ABOVE THE RIVER DELTA
4898-28461-0021 WE ARRIVED BEFORE NOON AT THE OLD TRADING POST CALLED BUCK'S IN FRONT OF THE STICKEEN GLACIER AND REMAINED LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FEW PASSENGERS WHO WISHED A NEARER VIEW TO CROSS THE RIVER TO THE TERMINAL MORAINE
4898-28461-0022 THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE ICE PINNACLES ALONG ITS TERMINAL WALL PRODUCED A WONDERFUL GLORY OF COLOR AND THE BROAD SPARKLING CRYSTAL PRAIRIE AND THE DISTANT SNOWY FOUNTAINS WERE WONDERFULLY ATTRACTIVE
4898-28461-0023 AND EXPANDS IN A BROAD FAN FIVE OR SIX MILES IN WIDTH SEPARATED FROM THE STICKEEN RIVER BY ITS BROAD TERMINAL MORAINE FRINGED WITH SPRUCES AND WILLOWS AROUND THE BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN CURVE OF THE MORAINE
4898-28461-0024 WAS ONCE UNITED FRONT TO FRONT WITH THE GREATER GLACIER THOUGH AT FIRST BOTH WERE TRIBUTARIES OF THE MAIN STICKEEN GLACIER WHICH ONCE FILLED THE WHOLE GRAND CANYON AFTER THE MAIN TRUNK CANYON WAS MELTED OUT
4898-28461-0025 CIRQUES AND BRANCH CANYONS ALONG THE TOPS AND SIDES OF THE WALLS THE INDIANS HAVE A TRADITION THAT THE RIVER USED TO RUN THROUGH A TUNNEL UNDER THE UNITED FRONTS OF THE TWO LARGE TRIBUTARY GLACIERS MENTIONED ABOVE
4898-28461-0026 WHICH ENTERED THE MAIN CANYON FROM EITHER SIDE AND THAT ON ONE OCCASION AN INDIAN ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIS WIFE HAD HER SENT ADRIFT IN A CANOE DOWN THROUGH THE ICE TUNNEL EXPECTING THAT SHE WOULD TROUBLE HIM NO MORE
4898-28461-0027 BUT TO HIS SURPRISE SHE FLOATED THROUGH UNDER THE ICE IN SAFETY ALL THE EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO GLACIERS INDICATES THAT THEY WERE UNITED AND FORMED A DAM ACROSS THE RIVER
4898-28461-0028 AND HAD RECEDED TO A GREATER OR LESSER HEIGHT ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS HARDLY OUT OF SIGHT ERE YOU COME UPON ANOTHER THAT POURS A MAJESTIC CRYSTAL FLOOD
4898-28461-0029 THROUGH THE EVERGREENS WHILE ALMOST EVERY HOLLOW AND TRIBUTARY CANYON CONTAINS A SMALLER ONE THE SIZE OF COURSE VARYING WITH THE EXTENT OF THE AREA DRAINED SOME ARE LIKE MERE SNOW BANKS OTHERS WITH THE BLUE ICE APPARENT
4898-28461-0030 DEPEND IN MASSIVE BULGING CURVES AND SWELLS AND GRADUATE INTO THE RIVER LIKE FORMS THAT MAZE THROUGH THE LOWER FORESTED REGIONS AND ARE SO STRIKING AND BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY ARE ADMIRED EVEN BY THE PASSING MINERS
4898-28461-0031 WITH GOLD DUST IN THEIR EYES THIRTY FIVE MILES ABOVE THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS THE DIRT GLACIER THE SECOND IN SIZE ITS OUTLET IS A FINE STREAM ABOUNDING IN TROUT
4898-28461-0032 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER THERE IS A GROUP OF FIVE GLACIERS ONE OF THEM DESCENDING TO WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THE RIVER NEAR GLENORA ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLANK OF THE MAIN COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0033 JUST BELOW A NARROW GORGE CALLED THE CANYON TERRACES FIRST MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE WHERE GREAT QUANTITIES OF MORAINE MATERIAL HAVE BEEN SWEPT THROUGH THE FLOOD CHOKED GORGE AND OF COURSE OUTSPREAD
4898-28461-0034 AND DEPOSITED ON THE FIRST OPEN LEVELS BELOW HERE TOO OCCURS A MARKED CHANGE IN CLIMATE AND CONSEQUENTLY IN FORESTS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY ON ACCOUNT OF DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THE WOODS ARE YOUNGER
4898-28461-0035 AND ARE COMPOSED OF SMALLER TREES ABOUT A FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET HIGH MOSTLY TWO LEAVED PINES WHICH HOLD THEIR SEEDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THEY ARE RIPE THE WOODS HERE ARE WITHOUT A TRACE
4898-28461-0036 OF THOSE DEEP ACCUMULATIONS OF MOSSES LEAVES AND DECAYING TRUNKS WHICH MAKE SO DAMP AND UNCLEARABLE MASS IN THE COAST FORESTS
4898-28461-0037 WHERE THE FOREST HAS BEEN UTTERLY DESTROYED THE RIVER BANK COTTONWOODS ARE ALSO SMALLER AND THE BIRCH AND CONTORTA PINES MINGLE FREELY WITH THE COAST HEMLOCK AND SPRUCE THE BIRCH IS COMMON ON THE LOWER SLOPES
4898-28461-0038 AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE ITS ROUND LEAFY PALE GREEN HEAD CONTRASTING WITH THE DARK NARROW SPIRES OF THE CONIFERS AND GIVING A STRIKING CHARACTER TO THE FOREST THE TAMARAC PINE OR BLACK PINE AS THE VARIETY OF
4898-28461-0039 WHERE IT HAS ESCAPED FIRE AND SNOW AVALANCHES THERE IS ANOTHER HANDSOME SPRUCE HEREABOUTS PICEA ALBA VERY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL IN HABIT DROOPING AT THE TOP LIKE A MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK
4898-28461-0040 I SAW FINE SPECIMENS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH ON DEEP BOTTOM LAND A FEW MILES BELOW GLENORA THE TOPS OF SOME OF THEM WERE ALMOST COVERED WITH DENSE CLUSTERS OF YELLOW AND BROWN CONES
4898-28461-0041 WE REACHED THE OLD HUDSON'S BAY TRADING POST AT GLENORA ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD STOP HERE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WOULD MAKE AN EARLY START FOR WRANGELL
4898-28461-0042 AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT MILES TO THE NORTHEASTWARD OF THE LANDING THERE IS AN OUTSTANDING GROUP OF MOUNTAINS CROWNING A SPUR FROM THE MAIN CHAIN OF THE COAST RANGE WHOSE HIGHEST POINT RISES ABOUT
4898-28461-0043 EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND AS GLENORA IS ONLY A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
4898-28461-0044 BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION IT OCCUPIED FOR GENERAL VIEWS OF THE PEAKS AND GLACIERS OF THE EAST SIDE OF THE GREAT RANGE ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST THREE AND THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT
4898-28461-0045 I THOUGHT THAT BY RAPID CLIMBING I COULD REACH THE SUMMIT BEFORE SUNSET IN TIME TO GET A GENERAL VIEW AND A FEW PENCIL SKETCHES AND MAKE MY WAY BACK TO THE STEAMER IN THE NIGHT MISTER YOUNG ONE OF THE MISSIONARIES ASKED PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY ME
4898-28461-0046 A FAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A SEASONED MOUNTAINEER TO BE DONE IN LESS THAN HALF A DAY AND PART OF A NIGHT BUT HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS A STRONG WALKER COULD DO A MOUNTAINEER'S DAY'S WORK IN HALF A DAY AND WOULD NOT HINDER ME IN ANY WAY
4898-28461-0047 WELL I HAVE WARNED YOU I SAID AND WILL NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY TROUBLE THAT MAY ARISE HE PROVED TO BE A STOUT WALKER AND WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS ACROSS A BRUSHY TIMBERED FLAT
4898-28461-0048 AND UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES OPEN IN SOME PLACES AND IN OTHERS THATCHED WITH DWARF FIRS RESTING A MINUTE HERE AND THERE TO REFRESH OURSELVES WITH HUCKLEBERRIES WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN OPEN SPOTS ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET
4898-28461-0049 WHEN WE WERE NEAR A CLUSTER OF CRUMBLING PINNACLES THAT FORMED THE SUMMIT I HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANXIETY ABOUT THE MOUNTAINEERING STRENGTH AND SKILL OF MY COMPANION AND PUSHED RAPIDLY ON IN PASSING AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHEST PINNACLE
4898-28461-0050 WHERE THE ROCK WAS RAPIDLY DISINTEGRATING AND THE DANGER OF SLIPPING WAS GREAT I SHOUTED IN A WARNING VOICE BE VERY CAREFUL HERE THIS IS DANGEROUS MISTER YOUNG WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN OR TWO YARDS BEHIND ME BUT OUT OF SIGHT
4898-28461-0051 I FOUND HOWEVER THAT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN SUCH A PLACE I THEREFORE TIED HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES WITH MY SUSPENDERS AND NECKTIE TO PREVENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INFLAMMATION FROM MOVEMENT I THEN LEFT HIM TELLING HIM TO LIE STILL
4898-28461-0052 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
4898-28461-0053 I REACHED UP TOOK HOLD OF HIM BY ONE OF HIS FEET AND GENTLY SLID HIM DOWN ON HIS BACK
4898-28461-0054 DUG HEEL NOTCHES AND SLID HIM DOWN TO THEM
4898-28461-0055 AND THE GLACIER WAS REACHED PERHAPS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HERE I TOOK OFF ONE OF MY BOOTS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS WRIST FOR A GOOD HOLD
4898-28461-0056 AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE OF HIS ARMS INTO PLACE
4898-28461-0057 I THEREFORE BOUND IT CLOSELY TO HIS SIDE AND ASKED HIM IF IN HIS EXHAUSTED AND TREMBLING CONDITION HE WAS STILL ABLE TO WALK YES HE BRAVELY REPLIED SO WITH A STEADYING ARM AROUND HIM AND MANY STOPS FOR REST
4898-28461-0058 I MARCHED HIM SLOWLY DOWN IN THE STARLIGHT ON THE COMPARATIVELY SMOOTH
4898-28461-0059 A DISTANCE OF PERHAPS A MILE CROSSED THE MORAINE BATHED HIS HEAD AT ONE OF THE OUTLET STREAMS AND AFTER MANY RESTS REACHED A DRY PLACE AND MADE A BRUSH FIRE I THEN WENT AHEAD LOOKING FOR AN OPEN WAY
4898-28461-0060 AND A LEAFY BED BESIDE IT I NOW TOLD HIM I WOULD RUN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN HASTEN BACK WITH HELP FROM THE BOAT AND CARRY HIM DOWN IN COMFORT BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF MY LEAVING HIM NO NO HE SAID I CAN WALK DOWN DON'T LEAVE ME
4898-28461-0061 I REMINDED HIM OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WAY HIS NERVE SHAKEN CONDITION AND ASSURED HIM I WOULD NOT BE GONE LONG BUT HE INSISTED ON TRYING
4898-28461-0062 AND MADE HIM LEAN ON MY SHOULDER WHILE I STEADIED HIM TO PREVENT HIS FALLING THIS SLOW STAGGERING STRUGGLE FROM FIRE TO FIRE LASTED UNTIL LONG AFTER SUNRISE WHEN AT LAST WE REACHED THE SHIP AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE NARROW SINGLE PLANK
4898-28461-0063 AT A CONSIDERABLE ANGLE I BRIEFLY EXPLAINED TO MISTER YOUNG'S COMPANIONS WHO STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT US THAT HE HAD BEEN HURT IN AN ACCIDENT AND REQUESTED ONE OF THEM TO ASSIST ME IN GETTING HIM ABOARD BUT STRANGE TO SAY INSTEAD OF COMING DOWN TO HELP
4898-28461-0064 THEY MADE HASTE TO REPROACH HIM FOR HAVING GONE ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE WITH MUIR THESE FOOLISH ADVENTURES ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR MISTER MUIR THEY SAID BUT YOU MISTER YOUNG HAVE A WORK TO DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU HAVE A CHURCH
4898-28461-0065 AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RISK YOUR LIFE ON TREACHEROUS PEAKS AND PRECIPICES
4898-28461-0066 HAD BEEN SWEARING IN ANGRY IMPATIENCE FOR BEING COMPELLED TO MAKE SO LATE A START AND THUS ENCOUNTER A DANGEROUS WIND IN A NARROW GORGE AND WAS THREATENING TO PUT THE MISSIONARIES ASHORE TO SEEK THEIR LOST COMPANION
4898-28461-0067 WHILE HE WENT ON DOWN THE RIVER ABOUT HIS BUSINESS BUT WHEN HE HEARD MY CALL FOR HELP HE HASTENED FORWARD AND ELBOWED THE DIVINES AWAY FROM THE END OF THE GANGPLANK SHOUTING IN ANGRY IRREVERENCE OH BLANK THIS IS NO TIME FOR PREACHING
4898-28461-0068 THEN WITH A MAN HOLDING DOWN HIS SHOULDERS WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE BONE INTO ITS SOCKET NOTWITHSTANDING THE INFLAMMATION AND CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES AND LIGAMENTS MISTER YOUNG WAS THEN PUT TO BED AND HE SLEPT ALL THE WAY BACK TO WRANGELL
39-121915-0000 BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
39-121915-0001 AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY THEN EMBODIED CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY
39-121915-0002 AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND
39-121915-0003 MISS CHURCHILL HOWEVER BEING OF AGE AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER FORTUNE THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY ESTATE
39-121915-0004 AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
39-121915-0005 MISSUS WESTON OUGHT TO HAVE FOUND MORE IN IT FOR SHE HAD A HUSBAND WHOSE WARM HEART AND SWEET TEMPER MADE HIM THINK EVERY THING DUE TO HER IN RETURN FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS OF BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT THOUGH SHE HAD ONE SORT OF SPIRIT
39-121915-0006 SHE HAD NOT THE BEST SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S UNREASONABLE ANGER
39-121915-0007 NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
39-121915-0008 SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND BUT SHE WANTED AT ONCE TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE CAPTAIN WESTON WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED
39-121915-0009 AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
39-121915-0010 AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
39-121915-0011 HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN LONDON WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY
39-121915-0012 WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
39-121915-0013 ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
39-121915-0014 AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS SCHEMES BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH
39-121915-0015 TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BOUGHT HIS HOUSE AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH
39-121915-0016 HE HAD NEVER BEEN AN UNHAPPY MAN HIS OWN TEMPER HAD SECURED HIM FROM THAT EVEN IN HIS FIRST MARRIAGE BUT HIS SECOND MUST SHEW HIM HOW DELIGHTFUL A WELL JUDGING AND TRULY AMIABLE WOMAN COULD BE
39-121915-0017 ON COMING OF AGE IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY
39-121915-0018 BUT IT WAS NOT IN MISTER WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR AND AS HE BELIEVED SO DESERVEDLY DEAR HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON AND WAS PROUD OF HIM
39-121915-0019 MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY AND A LIVELY CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED
39-121915-0020 BUT NEVER ACHIEVED NOW UPON HIS FATHER'S MARRIAGE IT WAS VERY GENERALLY PROPOSED AS A MOST PROPER ATTENTION
39-121915-0021 EITHER WHEN MISSUS PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MISSUS AND MISS BATES OR WHEN MISSUS AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED
39-121915-0022 WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
39-121915-0023 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL HAS WRITTEN TO MISSUS WESTON
39-121915-0024 MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
39-121915-0025 AND EVERY EXPRESSION OF CONGRATULATION WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED SHE FELT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT
39-121915-0026 BUT DEAR EMMA WAS OF NO FEEBLE CHARACTER
39-121915-0027 AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
39-121915-0028 HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
39-121915-0029 AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
39-121915-0030 TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
39-121915-0031 BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
39-121915-0032 THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO PITY HER BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MISTER WOODHOUSE THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER
39-121915-0033 BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE
39-121916-0000 MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
39-121916-0001 HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
39-121916-0002 AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
39-121916-0003 AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM
39-121916-0004 AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
39-121916-0005 FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
39-121916-0006 SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
39-121916-0007 AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY
39-121916-0008 AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL
39-121916-0009 AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
39-121916-0010 FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER
39-121916-0011 HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
39-121916-0012 IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL
39-121916-0013 BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
39-121916-0014 TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY
39-121916-0015 A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
39-121916-0016 SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
39-121916-0017 AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
39-121916-0018 NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
39-121916-0019 AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN
39-121916-0020 THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER
39-121916-0021 SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS
39-121916-0022 SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH
39-121916-0023 ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
39-121916-0024 WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
39-121916-0025 HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID
39-121916-0026 AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
39-121916-0027 SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY
39-121916-0028 MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
39-121916-0029 I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
39-121916-0030 WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
39-121916-0031 AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
1867-154071-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT TWO APPARITIONS
1867-154071-0001 FOUND A BIG DOUBLE ROOM THAT RAN ACROSS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK IT LOOKED DOWN ON THE LIGHTS GLIMMERING ON THE BLACK EAST RIVER AND ACROSS TO THE FLARE OF BROOKLYN TO THE LEFT THE WHOLE ARC OF THE FIFTY NINTH STREET BRIDGE WAS EXPOSED
1867-154071-0002 HERE THEY TOOK UP THE VIGIL
1867-154071-0003 BILL GREGG SHOOK HIS HEAD THAT'S NOT THE ONE SHE'S ALL DIFFERENT A PILE DIFFERENT RONICKY RONICKY SIGHED
1867-154071-0004 GO ON BACK TO SLEEP I'LL CALL YOU AGAIN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
1867-154071-0005 GHOST HOURS OF THE EARLY MORNING THEY DID NOT RELAX THEIR VIGIL
1867-154071-0006 APPARENTLY THE PLACE WAS A HARMLESS ROOMING HOUSE OF FAIRLY GOOD QUALITY NOT A SIGN OF CAROLINE SMITH APPEARED EVEN DURING THE SECOND DAY
1867-154071-0007 BY THIS TIME THE NERVES OF THE TWO WATCHERS WERE SHATTERED BY THE CONSTANT STRAIN AND THE MONOTONOUS VIEW FROM THE FRONT WINDOW WAS BEGINNING TO MADDEN THEM IT'S PROOF THAT SHE AIN'T YONDER SAID BILL GREGG
1867-154071-0008 AND HE GREW PALE AT THE THOUGHT PARTNER SAID RONICKY DOONE IF THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM US THEY SURE HAVE THE SENSE TO KEEP HER UNDER COVER FOR AS LONG AS TWO DAYS AIN'T THAT RIGHT
1867-154071-0009 IT'S JUST ABOUT OUR LAST CHANCE BILL WE'VE DONE OUR HUNTING PRETTY NEAR AS WELL AS WE COULD IF WE DON'T LAND HER THIS TRIP I'M ABOUT READY TO GIVE UP
1867-154071-0010 ONE WEEK WAS DECIDED ON AS A FAIR TEST IF AT THE END OF THAT TIME CAROLINE SMITH DID NOT COME OUT OF THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET THEY COULD CONCLUDE THAT SHE DID NOT STAY THERE
1867-154071-0011 PEERING THROUGH THE SLIT BETWEEN THE DRAWN CURTAINS WHICH SHELTERED HIM FROM BEING OBSERVED AT HIS SPYING WHEN HE CALLED OUT SOFTLY THE SOUND BROUGHT GREGG WITH ONE LONG LEAP OUT OF THE CHAIR WHERE HE WAS SLEEPING TO THE WINDOW THERE COULD BE NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT ABOUT IT
1867-154071-0012 THERE STOOD CAROLINE SMITH IN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND WALKING TO THE TOP OF THE STEPS PAUSED THERE AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET BILL GREGG GROANED
1867-154071-0013 SNATCHED HIS HAT AND PLUNGED THROUGH THE DOOR AND RONICKY HEARD THE BRIEF THUNDER OF HIS FEET DOWN THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS THEN THE HEAVY THUMPS AS HE RACED AROUND THE LANDING
1867-154071-0014 AND SO SWIFT WAS THAT DESCENT THAT WHEN THE GIRL IDLING DOWN THE STEPS ACROSS THE STREET CAME ONTO THE SIDEWALK BILL GREGG RUSHED OUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND RAN TOWARD HER
1867-154071-0015 FOR NEVER HAD THE MINER SEEMED SO CLUMSILY BIG AND GAUNT NEVER HAD HIS CLOTHES SEEMED SO UNPRESSED AND SHAPELESS WHILE HIS SOFT GRAY HAT TO WHICH HE STILL CLUNG RELIGIOUSLY APPEARED HOPELESSLY OUT OF PLACE IN CONTRAST WITH THE SLIM PRETTINESS OF THE GIRL
1867-154071-0016 SHE WORE A BLACK STRAW HAT TURNED BACK FROM HER FACE WITH A SINGLE BIG RED FLOWER AT THE SIDE OF IT
1867-154071-0017 THE SAME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEIR CLOTHES WAS IN THEIR FACES THE FINELY MODELED PRETTINESS OF HER FEATURES AND THE BIG CARELESS CHISELING OF THE FEATURES OF BILL GREGG RONICKY DOONE DID NOT WONDER THAT AFTER HER FIRST FEAR HER GESTURE WAS ONE OF DISDAIN AND SURPRISE
1867-154071-0018 HE WENT A LONG SLOW STEP CLOSER TO HER WITH BOTH HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED
1867-154071-0019 RONICKY DOONE FOLLOWED THAT GLANCE AND HE SAW ALL HIDDEN SAVE THE PROFILE OF THE FACE
1867-154071-0020 WHAT A FACE IT WAS NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD RONICKY DOONE SEEN A MAN WHO IN ONE INSTANT FILLED HIM WITH SUCH FEAR AND HATRED SUCH LOATHING AND SUCH DREAD SUCH SCORN AND SUCH TERROR
1867-154071-0021 THE NOSE WAS HOOKED LIKE THE NOSE OF A BIRD OF PREY THE EYES WERE LONG AND SLANTING LIKE THOSE OF AN ORIENTAL THE FACE WAS THIN ALMOST FLESHLESS SO THAT THE BONY JAW STOOD OUT LIKE THE JAW OF A DEATH'S HEAD
1867-154071-0022 THE GIRL HESITATED A MOMENT
1867-154071-0023 FOR SHE MADE A SLIGHT OUTWARD GESTURE WITH ONE HAND IF THIS WERE IN HER MIND HOWEVER IT VANISHED INSTANTLY SHE TURNED WITH A SHUDDER AND HURRIED AWAY DOWN THE STREET
1867-154071-0024 AS FOR BILL GREGG HE BORE HIMSELF STRAIGHT AS A SOLDIER AND CAME BACK ACROSS THE PAVEMENT BUT IT WAS THE ERECTNESS OF A SOLDIER WHO HAS MET WITH A CRUSHING DEFEAT AND ONLY PRESERVES AN OUTWARD RESOLUTION WHILE ALL THE SPIRIT WITHIN IS CRUSHED
1867-154071-0025 WHAT A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ASCENT AND THE DESCENT HE HAD LITERALLY FLOWN DOWN NOW HIS HEELS CLUMPED OUT A SLOW AND REGULAR DEATH MARCH AS HE CAME BACK TO THE ROOM WHEN GREGG OPENED THE DOOR
1867-154071-0026 RONICKY DOONE BLINKED AND DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AT THE SIGHT OF THE POOR FELLOW'S FACE GREGG HAD KNOWN BEFORE THAT HE TRULY LOVED THIS GIRL WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN
1867-154071-0027 NOW IN THE VERY MOMENT OF SEEING HIS DREAM OF THE GIRL TURNED INTO FLESH AND BLOOD HE HAD LOST HER AND THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE DEATH IN THE FACE OF THE BIG MINER AS HE DROPPED HIS HAT ON THE FLOOR AND SANK INTO A CHAIR
1867-154071-0028 AFTER THAT HE DID NOT MOVE SO MUCH AS A FINGER FROM THE POSITION INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN LIMPLY HIS LEGS WERE TWISTED AWKWARDLY SPRAWLING ACROSS THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HIM ONE LONG ARM DRAGGED DOWN TOWARD THE FLOOR
1867-154071-0029 AS IF THERE WAS NO STRENGTH IN IT TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE LABOR HARDENED HANDS HIS CHIN WAS FALLEN AGAINST HIS BREAST WHEN RONICKY DOONE CROSSED TO HIM AND LAID A KIND HAND ON HIS SHOULDER HE DID NOT LOOK UP IT'S ENDED
1867-154071-0030 SAID BILL GREGG FAINTLY NOW WE HIT THE BACK TRAIL AND FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS HE ADDED WITH A FAINT ATTEMPT AT CYNICISM I'VE JUST WASTED A PILE OF GOOD MONEY MAKING TIME FROM THE MINE THAT'S ALL
1867-154071-0031 SAID RONICKY DOONE BILL LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME MAN TO MAN THAT YOU'RE A LIAR HE ADDED CAN YOU EVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER MAN THE CRUELTY OF THAT SPEECH MADE GREGG FLUSH
1867-154071-0032 SAID GREGG HUSKILY AIN'T THERE THAT'S WHERE YOU AND ME DON'T AGREE

1867-154071-0042 SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE'D RUN AFTER YOU AND TRY TO EXPLAIN BUT THE FEAR OF THAT FELLOW UP IN THE WINDOW WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER AND SHE DIDN'T DARE BILL

1867-154075-0041 YOU'RE FREE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO GET EITHER OF US WILL YOU SHAKE ON THAT FOR A MOMENT THE LEADER HESITATED THEN HIS FINGERS CLOSED OVER THE EXTENDED HAND OF RONICKY DOONE AND CLAMPED DOWN ON THEM LIKE SO MANY STEEL WIRES CONTRACTING
1867-154075-0042 AT THE SAME TIME A FLUSH OF EXCITEMENT AND FIERCENESS PASSED OVER THE FACE OF JOHN MARK RONICKY DOONE TAKEN UTTERLY BY SURPRISE WAS AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE
1867-154075-0043 A GREAT RAGE CAME IN THE EYES OF JOHN MARK A GREAT WONDER CAME IN THE EYES OF THE WESTERNER WHERE DID JOHN MARK GET HIS SUDDEN STRENGTH WELL SAID RONICKY WE'VE SHAKEN HANDS AND NOW YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU PLEASE
1867-154075-0044 SIT DOWN LEAVE THE ROOM ANYTHING
1867-154075-0045 THAT BROUGHT A START FROM JOHN MARK AND A FLASH OF EAGERNESS BUT HE REPRESSED THE IDEA AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE GIRL WE'VE SHAKEN HANDS HE ADMITTED SLOWLY AS THOUGH JUST REALIZING THE FULL EXTENT OF THE MEANING OF THAT ACT
8419-286676-0000 THE CLEVER WATER ADDER NONE OF THE POND PEOPLE WERE ALONE MORE THAN THE WATER ADDERS THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL UNTIL THE DAY WHEN HE AND BELOSTOMA DROVE AWAY THE BOYS AFTER THAT
8419-286676-0001 HIS NEIGHBORS BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER AND HE WAS LESS GRUMPY SO THAT THOSE WHO WORE SHELLS WERE SOON QUITE FOND OF HIM BELOSTOMA DID NOT HAVE MANY FRIENDS AMONG THE SMALLER PEOPLE AND ONLY A FEW AMONG THE LARGER ONES THEY SAID THAT HE WAS CRUEL
8419-286676-0002 AND THAT HE HAD A BAD HABIT OF USING HIS STOUT SUCKING TUBE TO STING WITH STILL BELOSTOMA DID NOT CARE HE SAID A GIANT WATER BUG DOES NOT ALWAYS LIVE IN THE WATER I SHALL HAVE MY WINGS SOON AND LEAVE THE WATER AND MARRY
8419-286676-0003 AFTER THAT I SHALL FLY AWAY ON MY WEDDING TRIP MISSUS BELOSTOMA MAY GO WITH ME IF SHE FEELS LIKE DOING SO AFTER LAYING HER EGGS HERE I SHALL GO ANYWAY AND I SHALL FLUTTER AND SPRAWL AROUND THE LIGHT AND STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHER ME AND HAVE A HAPPY TIME
8419-286676-0004 THAT WAS BELOSTOMA'S WAY HE WOULD STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHERED HIM BUT THEN HE ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY NEED NOT HAVE BOTHERED HIM AND PERHAPS THAT WAS SO WITH THE WATER ADDERS IT WAS DIFFERENT THEY WERE GOOD NATURED ENOUGH
8419-286676-0005 YET THE MUD TURTLES AND SNAPPING TURTLE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO EVER CALLED UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM AT HOME THE SMALL PEOPLE WITHOUT SHELLS WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND THE CLAMS AND POND SNAILS NEVER CALLED UPON ANY ONE THE MINNOWS SAID THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE LOOKS OF THE ADDERS
8419-286676-0006 THEY HAD SUCH UGLY MOUTHS AND SUCH QUICK MOTIONS THE LARGER FISHES KEPT AWAY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE SMALL AND TENDER ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE SAND HILL CRANES THE FISH HAWKS AND THE OTHER SHORE FAMILIES WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS FOR THEM BUT WHEN THEY CALLED
8419-286676-0007 THE ADDERS WERE ALWAYS AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT THE ADDERS WERE AFRAID OF THEM THE YELLOW BROWN FROG WISHED THAT THE ADDERS COULD BE SCARED BADLY SCARED SOME TIME SO SCARED THAT A CHILLY FEELING WOULD RUN DOWN THEIR BACKS FROM THEIR HEADS CLEAR TO THE TIPS OF THEIR TAILS
8419-286676-0008 I WISH SAID HE THAT THE CHILLY FEELING WOULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO GO WAY THROUGH TO THEIR BELLIES THEIR BELLIES ARE ONLY THE FRONT SIDE OF THEIR BACKS ANYWAY HE ADDED BECAUSE THEY ARE SO THIN OF COURSE THIS WAS A DREADFUL WISH TO MAKE
8419-286676-0009 BUT PEOPLE SAID THAT ONE OF THE ADDERS HAD FRIGHTENED THE YELLOW BROWN FROG SO THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER IT AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE FELT SO THE WATER ADDERS WERE CERTAINLY THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE IN THE POND
8419-286676-0010 SHE COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING AND SHE KNEW IT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT TOO AND THAT SHOWED BAD TASTE AND WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE WAS NOT LIKED BETTER SHE COULD SWIM VERY FAST COULD CREEP GLIDE
8419-286676-0011 CATCH HOLD OF THINGS WITH HER TAIL HANG HERSELF FROM THE BRANCH OF A TREE LIFT HER HEAD FAR INTO THE AIR LEAP DART BOUND AND DIVE ALL HER FAMILY COULD DO THESE THINGS BUT SHE COULD DO THEM A LITTLE THE BEST ONE DAY SHE WAS HANGING OVER THE POND IN A VERY GRACEFUL POSITION
8419-286676-0012 WITH HER TAIL TWISTED CARELESSLY AROUND A WILLOW BRANCH THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND A MUD TURTLE FATHER WERE IN THE SHALLOW WATER BELOW HER HER SLENDER FORKED TONGUE WAS DARTING IN AND OUT OF HER OPEN MOUTH
8419-286676-0013 IT IS USEFUL IN FEELING OF THINGS SHE SAID AND THEN I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT QUITE BECOMING SHE COULD SEE HERSELF REFLECTED IN THE STILL WATER BELOW HER AND SHE NOTICED HOW PRETTILY THE DARK BROWN OF HER BACK SHADED INTO THE WHITE OF HER BELLY
8419-286676-0014 YOU SEE SHE WAS VAIN AS WELL AS CLEVER THE SNAPPING TURTLE FELT CROSS TO DAY AND HAD COME TO SEE IF A TALK WITH HER WOULD NOT MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER THE MUD TURTLE WAS TIRED OF HAVING THE CHILDREN SPRAWL AROUND HIM
8419-286676-0015 AND OF MISSUS MUD TURTLE TELLING ABOUT THE TROUBLE SHE HAD TO GET THE RIGHT KIND OF FOOD THE CLEVER WATER ADDER SPOKE FIRST OF THE WEATHER IT MUST BE DREADFULLY HOT FOR THE SHORE PEOPLE SHE SAID
8419-286676-0016 AND FLY AROUND IN THE SUNSHINE TO FIND FOOD FOR THEIR CHILDREN AH YES SAID THE MUD TURTLE HOW THEY MUST WISH FOR SHELLS HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT FOR TO FLY WITH
8419-286676-0017 LET THEM COME IN SWIMMING WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE WARM AND TIRED THE WATER ADDER LAUGHED IN HER SNAKY WAY AND SHOWED HER SHARP TEETH I HAVE HEARD SHE SAID THAT WHEN THE WILD DUCKS BRING THEIR CHILDREN HERE TO SWIM
8419-286676-0018 THEY DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY HOME AS THEY BROUGHT THE SNAPPING TURTLE BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS WARTY RIGHT FORELEG AND DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THE MUD TURTLE SMILED I HAVE HEARD SHE WENT ON
8419-286676-0019 THAT WHEN YOUNG DUCKS DIVE HEAD FIRST THEY ARE QUITE SURE TO COME UP AGAIN BUT THAT WHEN THEY DIVE FEET FIRST THEY NEVER COME UP
8419-286676-0020 ASKED THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND HE WAS SNAPPY ABOUT IT OH NOTHING REPLIED THE WATER ADDER SWINGING HER HEAD BACK AND FORTH AND LOOKING AT THE SCALES ON HER BODY I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0021 AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING AND IF I AM SWIMMING UNDER THE WATER AND A DUCKLING PADDLES ALONG JUST ABOVE ME AND STICKS HIS FOOT INTO MY MOUTH I AM LIKELY TO SWALLOW HIM BEFORE I THINK THE WATER ADDER SAW THAT HE WAS PROVOKED BY WHAT SHE HAD SAID SO SHE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
8419-286676-0022 I THINK THE DUCKS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN SAID SHE THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS OVER THEM AND THEY ARE NOT NEARLY SO BRIGHT AS MY CHILDREN WHY MINE HATCH AS SOON AS THE EGGS ARE LAID AND GO HUNTING AT ONCE THEY ARE NO TROUBLE AT ALL
8419-286676-0023 I NEVER WORRY ABOUT MINE SAID THE MUD TURTLE ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER THINKS IT IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM ALL TO SLEEP AT ONCE AS THEY DO ON A LOG IN THE SUNSHINE IT ISN'T SAID THE ADDER DECIDEDLY I NEVER CLOSE MY EYES
8419-286676-0024 MOST OF THEM REMARKED THE TURTLES ALL OF THEM SHE SAID EXCEPT US ADDERS AND THE TURTLES I EVEN THINK THAT SOME OF THE TURTLES ARE A LITTLE QUEER DON'T YOU WE HAVE THOUGHT SO SAID THE MUD TURTLE
8419-286676-0025 THEY CERTAINLY ARE AGREED THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MUCH BETTER NATURED WHAT DID YOU SAY ASKED THE ADDER WHO LIKE ALL HER FAMILY WAS A LITTLE DEAF OUCH EXCLAIMED THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0026 OUCH OUCH WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE MUD TURTLE THEN HE BEGAN TO SLAP THE WATER WITH HIS SHORT STOUT TAIL AND SAY OUCH
8419-286676-0027 TWO NAUGHTY YOUNG WATER BOATMEN HAD SWUM QUIETLY UP ON THEIR BACKS AND STUNG THE TURTLES ON THEIR TAILS THEN THEY SWAM AWAY PUSHING THEMSELVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH SWIFT STROKES OF THEIR HAIRY OAR LEGS
8419-286676-0028 AND HE BACKED INTO THE MUD KNOWING THAT FINE SOFT MUD IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR STINGS
8419-286676-0029 IF I COULD ONLY REACH MY TAIL WITH MY HEAD OR EVEN WITH ONE OF MY HIND FEET
8419-286676-0030 ASKED THE WATER ADDER IN HER SWEETEST VOICE NOTHING IS EASIER AND SHE WOUND HERSELF AROUND THE WILLOW BRANCH IN ANOTHER GRACEFUL POSITION AND TOOK THE TIP OF HER TAIL DAINTILY BETWEEN HER TEETH HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0031 AND HE PULLED HIS TAIL OUT OF THE MUD AND SWAM AWAY
8419-286676-0032 SAID THE MUD TURTLE AND HE SWAM AWAY WITH THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT A RUDE PERSON SHE IS THEY SAID ALWAYS TRYING TO SHOW HOW MUCH MORE CLEVER SHE IS THAN OTHER PEOPLE WE WOULD RATHER BE STUPID AND POLITE AFTER A WHILE THE SNAPPING TURTLE SAID
8419-286676-0033 BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT STUPID OF COURSE NOT REPLIED THE MUD TURTLE
8419-293469-0000 IN ALL THE MEADOW THERE WAS NOBODY WHO COULD TELL SUCH INTERESTING STORIES AS THE OLD TREE FROG EVEN THE GARTER SNAKE WHO HAD BEEN THERE THE LONGEST AND THE OLD CRICKET WHO HAD LIVED IN THE FARM YARD COULD TELL NO SUCH EXCITING TALES AS THE TREE FROG
8419-293469-0001 ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS OF WHICH HE TOLD HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE CAME TO THE MEADOW
8419-293469-0002 NONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD KNOWN HIM THEN BUT HE WAS AN HONEST FELLOW AND THEY WERE SURE THAT EVERYTHING HE TOLD WAS TRUE BESIDES THEY MUST BE TRUE FOR HOW COULD A BODY EVER THINK OUT SUCH REMARKABLE TALES FROM HIS OWN HEAD
8419-293469-0003 WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO HIS HOME BY THE ELM TREE HE WAS VERY THIN AND LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SICK THE KATYDIDS WHO STAYED NEAR SAID THAT HE CROAKED IN HIS SLEEP AND THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT WHAT WELL AND HAPPY FROGS SHOULD DO
8419-293469-0004 ONE DAY WHEN MANY OF THE MEADOW PEOPLE WERE GATHERED AROUND HIM HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW HE SAID I WAS STRONG AND WELL AND COULD LEAP FARTHER THAN ANY OTHER FROG OF MY SIZE
8419-293469-0005 I WAS HATCHED IN THE POND BEYOND THE FARM HOUSE AND ATE MY WAY FROM THE EGG TO THE WATER OUTSIDE LIKE ANY OTHER FROG PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY LIKE ANY OTHER TADPOLE FOR OF COURSE I BEGAN LIFE AS A TADPOLE
8419-293469-0006 I PLAYED AND ATE WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND LITTLE DREAMED WHAT TROUBLE WAS IN STORE FOR ME WHEN I GREW UP WE WERE ALL IN A HURRY TO BE FROGS
8419-293469-0007 OH HOW HAPPY WE WERE THEN I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN MY HIND LEGS BEGAN TO GROW AND HOW THE OTHER TADPOLES CROWDED AROUND ME IN THE WATER AND SWAM CLOSE TO ME TO FEEL THE TWO LITTLE BUNCHES THAT WERE TO BE LEGS
8419-293469-0008 MY FORE LEGS DID NOT GROW UNTIL LATER AND THESE BUNCHES CAME JUST IN FRONT OF MY TAIL YOUR TAIL CRIED A PUZZLED YOUNG CRICKET
8419-293469-0009 I DID HAVE WHEN I WAS A TADPOLE SAID THE TREE FROG I HAD A BEAUTIFUL WIGGLY LITTLE TAIL WITH WHICH TO SWIM THROUGH THE WATERS OF THE POND BUT AS MY LEGS GREW LARGER AND STRONGER MY TAIL GREW LITTLER AND WEAKER UNTIL THERE WASN'T ANY TAIL LEFT
8419-293469-0010 THE KNOBS ON THE ENDS OF MY TOES WERE STICKY SO THAT I COULD CLIMB A TREE AND THEN I WAS READY TO START ON MY TRAVELS SOME OF THE OTHER FROGS STARTED WITH ME BUT THEY STOPPED ALONG THE WAY AND AT LAST I WAS ALONE
8419-293469-0011 I WAS A BOLD YOUNG FELLOW AND WHEN I SAW A GREAT WHITE THING AMONG THE TREES UP YONDER I MADE UP MY MIND TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THERE WAS A GREAT RED THING IN THE YARD BESIDE IT BUT I LIKED THE WHITE ONE BETTER
8419-293469-0012 I HOPPED ALONG AS FAST AS I COULD FOR I DID NOT THEN KNOW ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID I GOT CLOSE UP TO THEM BOTH AND SAW STRANGE BIG CREATURES GOING IN AND OUT OF THE RED THING THE BARN AS I AFTERWARD FOUND IT WAS CALLED
8419-293469-0013 THE LARGEST CREATURES HAD FOUR LEGS AND SOME OF THEM HAD HORNS THE SMALLER CREATURES HAD ONLY TWO LEGS ON WHICH TO WALK AND TWO OTHER LIMBS OF SOME SORT WITH WHICH THEY LIFTED AND CARRIED THINGS
8419-293469-0014 THE QUEEREST THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE SMALLER CREATURES SEEMED TO MAKE THE LARGER ONES DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED THEM TO THEY EVEN MADE SOME OF THEM HELP DO THEIR WORK YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME BUT WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE
8419-293469-0015 AS YOU MAY GUESS I STAYED THERE A LONG TIME WATCHING THESE STRANGE CREATURES WORK
8419-293469-0016 THERE WERE SOME BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS NEAR THE HOUSE AND I CRAWLED IN AMONG THEM THERE I RESTED UNTIL SUNSET AND THEN BEGAN MY EVENING SONG WHILE I WAS SINGING ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND FOUND ME
8419-293469-0017 SHE PICKED ME UP AND CARRIED ME INSIDE OH HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS MY HEART THUMPED AS THOUGH IT WOULD BURST AND I TRIED MY BEST TO GET AWAY FROM HER SHE DIDN'T HURT ME AT ALL BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET ME GO
8419-293469-0018 SHE PUT ME IN A VERY QUEER PRISON AT FIRST WHEN SHE PUT ME DOWN ON A STONE IN SOME WATER I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS IN PRISON I TRIED TO HOP AWAY AND BUMP WENT MY HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING
8419-293469-0019 WONDERFUL INDEED AND AT THE TOP CONTINUED THE TREE FROG WAS SOMETHING WHITE OVER THE DOORWAY INTO MY PRISON IN THE BOTTOM WERE WATER AND A STONE AND FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP WAS A LADDER
8419-293469-0020 I HAD ENOUGH TO EAT BUT ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN FREE CANNOT BE HAPPY SHUT IN I WATCHED MY CHANCE AND THREE TIMES I GOT OUT WHEN THE LITTLE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE CLOSED TWICE I WAS CAUGHT AND PUT BACK
8419-293469-0021 IN THE PLEASANT WEATHER OF COURSE I WENT TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND WHEN IT WAS GOING TO RAIN I WOULD GO DOWN AGAIN EVERY TIME THAT I WENT UP OR DOWN THOSE DREADFUL CREATURES WOULD PUT THEIR FACES UP CLOSE TO MY PRISON
8419-293469-0022 AND I COULD HEAR A ROARING SOUND WHICH MEANT THEY WERE TALKING AND LAUGHING THE LAST TIME I GOT OUT
8419-293469-0023 AFTER THEY STOPPED HUNTING THE WIND BLEW THE DOOR OPEN AND I HOPPED OUT YOU DON'T SAY EXCLAIMED A GRASSHOPPER
8419-293469-0024 BUT FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMING THAT I WAS BACK IN PRISON AND I WOULD CROAK IN MY SLEEP AT THE THOUGHT OF IT I HEARD YOU CRIED THE KATYDID AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS THE MATTER MATTER ENOUGH SAID THE TREE FROG
8419-293469-0025 IT MAKES MY SKIN DRY TO THINK OF IT NOW AND FRIENDS THE BEST WAY I CAN EVER REPAY YOUR KINDNESS TO ME IS TO TELL YOU TO NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER GO NEAR THE FARM HOUSE AND THEY ALL ANSWERED
8419-293473-0000 THE DIGNIFIED WALKING STICKS THREE WALKING STICKS FROM THE FOREST HAD COME TO LIVE IN THE BIG MAPLE TREE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW NOBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHY THEY HAD LEFT THE FOREST WHERE ALL THEIR SISTERS AND COUSINS AND AUNTS LIVED
8419-293473-0001 PERHAPS THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR RELATIVES BUT THEN IF ONE IS A WALKING STICK YOU KNOW ONE DOES NOT CARE SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ONE'S FAMILY THESE WALKING STICKS HAD GROWN UP THE BEST WAY THEY COULD WITH NO FATHER OR MOTHER TO CARE FOR THEM
8419-293473-0002 THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL OR TO THINK MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE HUNGRY THEY ATE SOME LEAVES AND NEVER THOUGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY WHEN THEY WERE TIRED THEY WENT TO SLEEP
8419-293473-0003 AND WHEN THEY HAD SLEPT ENOUGH THEY AWAKENED THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY DID NOT OFTEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO THINK THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THOSE MEADOW PEOPLE WHO RUSHED AND SCRAMBLED AND WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND THEY SHOWED VERY PLAINLY HOW THEY FELT
8419-293473-0004 THEY SAID IT WAS NOT GENTEEL TO HURRY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED ONE DAY THE TREE FROG WAS UNDER THE TREE WHEN THE LARGE BROWN WALKING STICK DECIDED TO LAY SOME EGGS HE SAW HER DROPPING THEM CARELESSLY AROUND ON THE GROUND AND ASKED
8419-293473-0005 DO YOU NEVER FIX A PLACE FOR YOUR EGGS A PLACE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK WAVING HER LONG AND SLENDER FEELERS TO AND FRO A PLACE OH NO I THINK THEY WILL HATCH WHERE THEY ARE IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND A PLACE
8419-293473-0006 SOME MOTHERS DO NOT THINK IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE THEY LAY EGGS THAT MAY BE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO OUR FAMILY SHE SPOKE AS IF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELONG TO HER FAMILY MIGHT BE GOOD BUT COULD NEVER BE GENTEEL
8419-293473-0007 SHE HAD ONCE TOLD HER BROTHER THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK THAT SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE IF SHE COULD NOT BE GENTEEL SHE THOUGHT THE MEADOW PEOPLE VERY COMMON THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK LOOKED MUCH LIKE HIS SISTER HE HAD THE SAME LONG SLENDER BODY
8419-293473-0008 THE SAME LONG FEELERS AND THE SAME SORT OF LONG SLENDER LEGS IF YOU HAD PASSED THEM IN A HAY FIELD YOU WOULD SURELY HAVE THOUGHT EACH A STEM OF HAY UNLESS YOU HAPPENED TO SEE THEM MOVE THE OTHER WALKING STICK THEIR FRIEND WAS YOUNGER AND GREEN
8419-293473-0009 HE KNEW JUST WHAT TO EXPECT SO WHEN THE NUTHATCH SET HIM DOWN ON THE BARK TO LOOK AT HIM HE UNHOOKED HIS FEET FROM THE BARK AND TUMBLED TO THE GROUND THE NUTHATCH TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND BROKE OFF ONE OF HIS LEGS BUT SHE NEVER FOUND HIM AGAIN ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
8419-293473-0010 THAT WAS BECAUSE HE CRAWLED INTO A CLUMP OF FERNS AND KEPT VERY STILL HIS SISTER CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY A SPIDER IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WOULD HAVE SIX LEGS AGAIN
8419-293473-0011 OF COURSE YOU KNOW SPIDERS NEVER DO HAVE A HUNDRED AND A WALKING STICK WOULDN'T BE WALKING WITHOUT ANY BUT THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF SPEAKING AND IT SHOWED WHAT KIND OF INSECT HE WAS HIS RELATIVES ALL WAVED THEIR FEELERS ONE AT A TIME AND SAID
8419-293473-0012 AH HE HAS THE TRUE WALKING STICK SPIRIT THEN THEY PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM AND AFTER A WHILE HE AND HIS SISTER AND THEIR GREEN LITTLE FRIEND LEFT THE FOREST FOR THE MEADOW ON THE DAY WHEN THE GRASS WAS CUT THEY HAD SAT QUIETLY IN THEIR TREES AND LOOKED GENTEEL
8419-293473-0013 THEIR FEELERS WERE HELD QUITE CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEY DID NOT MOVE THEIR FEET AT ALL ONLY SWAYED THEIR BODIES GRACEFULLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE NOW THEY WERE ON THE GROUND HUNTING THROUGH THE FLAT PILES OF CUT GRASS FOR SOME FRESH AND JUICY BITS TO EAT
8419-293473-0014 THE ANTS WERE SCRAMBLING AROUND AS BUSY AS EVER AND LIFE WENT ON QUITE AS THOUGH NEITHER MEN NOR HORSES HAD EVER ENTERED THE MEADOW SEE CRIED A SPIDER WHO WAS BUSILY LOOKING AFTER HER WEB THERE COMES A HORSE DRAWING SOMETHING AND THE FARMER SITTING ON IT AND DRIVING
8419-293473-0015 WHEN THE HORSE WAS WELL INTO THE MEADOW THE FARMER MOVED A BAR AND THE QUEER LOOKING MACHINE BEGAN TO KICK THE GRASS THIS WAY AND THAT WITH ITS MANY STIFF AND SHINING LEGS A FRISKY YOUNG GRASSHOPPER KICKED IN THE SAME WAY AND HAPPENED JUST HAPPENED OF COURSE
8419-293473-0016 THEN THERE WAS A GREAT SCRAMBLING AND THE CRICKETS FROLICKED WITH THEM THE YOUNG WALKING STICK THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE GREAT FUN AND ALMOST WISHED HERSELF SOME OTHER KIND OF INSECT SO THAT SHE COULD TUMBLE AROUND IN THE SAME WAY SHE DID NOT QUITE WISH IT YOU UNDERSTAND
8419-293473-0017 AND WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT IF SHE HAD TURNED BROWN AH SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK WHAT SCRAMBLING HOW VERY COMMON YES INDEED SAID HIS SISTER WHY CAN'T THEY LEARN TO MOVE SLOWLY AND GRACEFULLY
8419-293473-0018 PERHAPS THEY CAN'T HELP BEING FAT BUT THEY MIGHT AT LEAST ACT GENTEEL WHAT IS IT TO BE GENTEEL ASKED A GRASSHOPPER SUDDENLY HE HAD HEARD EVERY WORD THAT THE WALKING STICK SAID WHY SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK
8419-293473-0019 IT IS JUST TO BE GENTEEL TO ACT AS YOU SEE US ACT AND TO JUST HERE THE HAY TEDDER PASSED OVER THEM AND EVERY ONE OF THE WALKING STICKS WAS SENT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AND LANDED ON HIS BACK
8419-293473-0020 THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
27-124992-0000 IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE THE HIGH PRIEST ELIACHIM CALLED ALSO JOACHIM THE TRANSACTIONS HEREIN RELATED MOST PROBABLY HAPPENED IN HIS DAYS AND IN THE REIGN OF MANASSES AFTER HIS REPENTANCE AND RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY
27-124992-0001 IT TAKES ITS NAME FROM THAT ILLUSTRIOUS WOMAN BY WHOSE VIRTUE AND FORTITUDE AND ARMED WITH PRAYER THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE PRESERVED FROM THE DESTRUCTION THREATENED THEM BY HOLOFERNES AND HIS GREAT ARMY
27-124992-0002 SWORE BY HIS THRONE AND KINGDOM THAT HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES
27-124992-0003 THE TWO AND TWENTIETH DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH

27-124992-0006 GO OUT AGAINST ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WEST
27-124992-0007 CALLED THE CAPTAINS AND OFFICERS OF THE POWER OF THE ASSYRIANS AND HE MUSTERED MEN FOR THE EXPEDITION AND THE KING COMMANDED HIM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN ON FOOT AND TWELVE THOUSAND ARCHERS
27-124992-0008 WITH ALL PROVISIONS SUFFICIENT FOR THE ARMIES IN ABUNDANCE AND HERDS OF OXEN AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP
27-124992-0009 WITH THE CHARIOTS AND HORSEMEN AND ARCHERS
27-124992-0010 HE CAME TO THE GREAT MOUNTAINS OF ANGE
27-124992-0011 AND HE WENT UP TO ALL THEIR CASTLES
27-124992-0012 AND PILLAGED ALL THE CHILDREN OF THARSIS
27-124992-0013 WHO WERE OVER AGAINST THE FACE OF THE DESERT
27-124992-0014 AND HE FORCED ALL THE STATELY CITIES THAT WERE THERE FROM THE TORRENT OF MAMBRE
27-124992-0015 AND STRIPPED THEM OF ALL THEIR RICHES AND ALL THAT RESISTED HIM
27-124992-0016 AND HE SET ALL THE CORN ON FIRE
27-124992-0017 JUDITH CHAPTER THREE
27-124992-0018 HE DESTROYETH THEIR CITIES AND THEIR GODS
27-124992-0019 MESOPOTAMIA AND SYRIA SOBAL AND LIBYA
27-124992-0020 AND BE SUBJECT TO THEE THAN TO DIE AND TO PERISH
27-124992-0021 ALL MOUNTAINS AND HILLS AND FIELDS AND HERDS OF OXEN AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP AND GOATS AND HORSES AND CAMELS
27-124992-0022 AND MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF EVERY CITY
27-124992-0023 THAT THE INHABITANTS OF ALL THE CITIES BOTH PRINCES AND NOBLES AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE
27-124992-0024 THAT HE ONLY MIGHT BE CALLED GOD BY THOSE NATIONS WHICH COULD BE BROUGHT UNDER HIM
27-124992-0025 AND ALL APAMEA AND ALL MESOPOTAMIA
27-124992-0026 AND STAYED THERE FOR THIRTY DAYS
27-124992-0027 JUDITH CHAPTER FOUR
27-124992-0028 LEST HE SHOULD DO THE SAME TO JERUSALEM AND TO THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
27-124992-0029 WROTE TO ALL THAT WERE OVER AGAINST ESDRELON
27-124992-0030 AND TO ALL BY WHOM THERE MIGHT BE A PASSAGE OF WAY THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF THE ASCENTS OF THE MOUNTAINS BY WHICH THERE MIGHT BE ANY WAY TO JERUSALEM
27-124992-0031 AND THEY HUMBLED THEIR SOULS IN FASTINGS AND PRAYERS
27-124992-0032 AND THEY CAUSED THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO LIE PROSTRATE BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
27-124992-0033 THAT THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT NOT BE MADE A PREY AND THEIR WIVES CARRIED OFF AND THEIR CITIES DESTROYED AND THEIR HOLY THINGS PROFANED
27-124992-0034 KNOW YE THAT THE LORD WILL HEAR YOUR PRAYERS
27-124992-0035 THAT TRUSTED IN HIS OWN STRENGTH AND IN HIS POWER AND IN HIS ARMY AND IN HIS SHIELDS AND IN HIS CHARIOTS AND IN HIS HORSEMEN NOT BY FIGHTING WITH THE SWORD
27-124992-0036 JUDITH CHAPTER FIVE
27-124992-0037 THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL PREPARED THEMSELVES TO RESIST
27-124992-0038 OR WHAT ARE THEIR CITIES AND OF WHAT SORT AND HOW GREAT ALSO WHAT IS THEIR POWER OR WHAT IS THEIR MULTITUDE
27-124992-0039 HAVE DESPISED US AND HAVE NOT COME OUT TO MEET US
27-124992-0040 ANSWERING SAID IF THOU VOUCHSAFE MY LORD TO HEAR I WILL TELL THE TRUTH IN THY SIGHT CONCERNING THIS PEOPLE THAT DWELLETH IN THE MOUNTAINS
27-124992-0041 WHO ALSO COMMANDED THEM TO DEPART FROM THENCE AND TO DWELL IN CHARAN AND WHEN THERE WAS A FAMINE OVER ALL THE LAND THEY WENT DOWN INTO EGYPT AND THERE FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WERE SO MULTIPLIED
27-124992-0042 AND MADE SLAVES OF THEM TO LABOUR IN CLAY AND BRICK IN THE BUILDING OF HIS CITIES THEY CRIED TO THEIR LORD AND HE STRUCK THE WHOLE LAND OF EGYPT
27-124992-0043 AND THE PLAGUE HAD CEASED FROM THEM AND THEY HAD A MIND TO TAKE THEM AGAIN
27-124992-0044 SO THAT THE WATERS WERE MADE TO STAND FIRM AS A WALL ON EITHER SIDE
27-124992-0045 THEY WERE SO OVERWHELMED WITH THE WATERS
27-124992-0046 IN WHICH NEVER MAN COULD DWELL
27-124992-0047 AND OF THE HETHITES AND OF THE HEVITES AND OF THE AMORRHITES AND ALL THE MIGHTY ONES IN HESEBON
27-124992-0048 WHEN THEY HAD REVOLTED FROM THE WAY WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN THEM TO WALK THEREIN THEY WERE DESTROYED IN BATTLES BY MANY NATIONS AND VERY MANY OF THEM WERE LED AWAY CAPTIVE
27-124992-0049 FROM THE DIFFERENT PLACES WHEREIN THEY WERE SCATTERED THEY ARE COME TOGETHER
27-124992-0050 IF THERE BE ANY INIQUITY OF THEIRS IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR GOD LET US GO UP TO THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL SURELY DELIVER THEM TO THEE
27-124992-0051 WE CANNOT RESIST THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL DEFEND THEM
27-124992-0052 WHEN ACHIOR HAD CEASED TO SPEAK THESE WORDS ALL THE GREAT MEN OF HOLOFERNES WERE ANGRY
27-124992-0053 AND HIS ARMIES MEN UNARMED AND WITHOUT FORCE
27-124992-0054 LET US GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND WHEN THE BRAVEST OF THEM SHALL BE TAKEN
27-124992-0055 AND BESIDES HIM THERE IS NO OTHER JUDITH CHAPTER SIX
27-124992-0056 WHEN THEY HAD LEFT OFF SPEAKING THAT HOLOFERNES BEING IN A VIOLENT PASSION
27-124992-0057 THAT THE NATION OF ISRAEL IS DEFENDED BY THEIR GOD
27-124992-0058 THEN THOU ALSO SHALT DIE WITH THEM BY THE SWORD OF THE ASSYRIANS
27-124992-0059 AND THEN THE SWORD OF MY SOLDIERS SHALL PASS THROUGH THY SIDES AND THOU SHALT BE STABBED AND FALL AMONG THE WOUNDED OF ISRAEL
27-124992-0060 LET NOT THY COUNTENANCE SINK AND LET THE PALENESS THAT IS IN THY FACE DEPART FROM THEE
27-124992-0061 BEHOLD FROM THIS HOUR THOU SHALT BE ASSOCIATED TO THEIR PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY SHALL RECEIVE THE PUNISHMENT THEY DESERVE FROM MY SWORD
27-124992-0062 AND TO LEAD HIM TO BETHULIA
27-124992-0063 WENT THROUGH THE PLAINS BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THE MOUNTAINS
27-124992-0064 AND SO LEFT HIM BOUND WITH ROPES
27-124992-0065 AND SETTING HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE ASKED HIM
27-124992-0066 AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEING ASKED BY HOLOFERNES
27-124992-0067 HAD COMMANDED HIM TO BE DELIVERED FOR THIS CAUSE TO THE ISRAELITES THAT WHEN HE SHOULD OVERCOME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THEN HE MIGHT COMMAND ACHIOR ALSO HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH BY DIVERSE TORMENTS FOR HAVING SAID
27-124992-0068 ALL THE PEOPLE FELL UPON THEIR FACES ADORING THE LORD AND ALL OF THEM TOGETHER MOURNING AND WEEPING
27-124992-0069 O LORD GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH BEHOLD THEIR PRIDE AND LOOK ON OUR LOW CONDITION AND HAVE REGARD TO THE FACE OF THY SAINTS AND SHEW THAT THOU FORSAKEST NOT THEM THAT TRUST ON THEE
27-124992-0070 THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS WHOSE POWER THOU HAST SET FORTH WILL MAKE THIS RETURN TO THEE
27-124992-0071 LET GOD BE WITH THEE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF US THAT AS IT SHALL PLEASE THEE SO THOU WITH ALL THINE
27-124992-0072 AFTER THE ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN UP RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOUSE
27-124992-0073 AND THEY REFRESHED THEMSELVES TOGETHER
27-124992-0074 AND THEY PRAYED ALL THE NIGHT LONG WITHIN THE CHURCH DESIRING HELP OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL
27-124992-0075 THE CHURCH THAT IS THE SYNAGOGUE OR PLACE WHERE THEY MET FOR PRAYER JUDITH CHAPTER SEVEN HOLOFERNES BESIEGETH BETHULIA
27-124992-0076 AND TWO AND TWENTY THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE PREPARATIONS OF THOSE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN
27-124992-0077 AND THEY CAME BY THE HILLSIDE TO THE TOP WHICH LOOKETH TOWARD DOTHAIN FROM THE PLACE WHICH IS CALLED BELMA UNTO CHELMON
27-124992-0078 WHEN THEY SAW THE MULTITUDE OF THEM PROSTRATED THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND
7447-91187-0000 THE PIANO BARD THE PIANO RHAPSODIST THE PIANO MIND THE PIANO SOUL IS CHOPIN SAID RUBINSTEIN TRAGIC ROMANTIC LYRIC HEROIC DRAMATIC FANTASTIC SOULFUL
7447-91187-0001 SWEET DREAMY BRILLIANT GRAND SIMPLE ALL POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS ARE FOUND IN HIS COMPOSITIONS AND ALL ARE SUNG BY HIM ON HIS INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0002 IN THESE FEW BOLD STROKES ONE WHO KNEW HIM BY VIRTUE OF CLOSE ART AND RACE KINSHIP PRESENTS AN INCOMPARABLE OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE POLISH TONE POET
7447-91187-0003 WHO EXPLORED THE HARMONIC VASTNESS OF THE PIANOFORTE AND MADE HIS OWN ALL ITS MYSTIC SECRETS BORN AND BRED ON POLAND'S SOIL SON OF A FRENCH FATHER AND A POLISH MOTHER FREDERIC CHOPIN
7447-91187-0004 COMBINED WITHIN HIMSELF TWO NATURES EACH COMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BOTH UNITING TO FORM A PERSONALITY NOT UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY CASUAL OBSERVER HE IS DESCRIBED AS KIND COURTEOUS
7447-91187-0005 POSSESSED OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING GRACE AND EASE OF MANNER NOW INCLINED TO LANGUOROUS MELANCHOLY NOW SCINTILLATING WITH A JOYOUS VIVACITY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS
7447-91187-0006 HIS SENSITIVE NATURE LIKE THE MOST EXQUISITELY CONSTRUCTED SOUNDING BOARD VIBRATED WITH THE DESPAIRING SADNESS THE SUPPRESSED WRATH AND THE SUBLIME FORTITUDE OF THE BRAVE HAUGHTY
7447-91187-0007 UNHAPPY PEOPLE HE LOVED AND WITH HIS OWN HOMESICKNESS WHEN AFAR FROM HIS CHERISHED NATIVE LAND PATRIOT AND TONE POET IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
7447-91187-0008 HIS GENIUS INEVITABLY CLAIMED AS ITS OWN THE SOUL'S DIVINEST LANGUAGE PURE MUSIC UNFETTERED BY WORDS THE PROFOUND RESERVE OF HIS NATURE MADE IT PECULIARLY
7447-91187-0009 AGREEABLE TO HIM TO GRATIFY THE HAUNTING DEMANDS OF HIS LYRIC MUSE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE ONE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THAT LENDS ITSELF IN PRIVACY TO THE EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE MYSTERIES OF HARMONY
7447-91187-0010 STRONG CONVICTION IN REGARD TO HIS OWN CALLING AND CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS AND FUTURE MISSION OF THE PIANO EARLY COMPELLED HIM TO CONSECRATE TO IT HIS UNFALTERING DEVOTION
7447-91187-0011 HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
7447-91187-0012 AND ENDOWED IT WITH A WARMTH OF TONE COLORING THAT SPIRITUALIZED IT FOR ALL TIME TO THE PIANO HE CONFIDED ALL THE CONFLICTS THAT RAGED WITHIN HIM ALL THE COURAGE AND LIVING HOPE THAT SUSTAINED HIM
7447-91187-0013 IN GIVING TONAL FORM TO THE DEEP THINGS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR ESSENCE AND APPLICATION HE EMBODIED UNIVERSAL RATHER THAN MERELY INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES
7447-91187-0014 AND THUS UNBARED WHAT WAS MOST SACRED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT JARRING ON THE INNATE RETICENCE WHICH MADE PURELY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES IMPOSSIBLE
7447-91187-0015 ALTHOUGH HIS MODE OF EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY HIS OWN HE HAD RECEIVED A STRONG IMPULSE FROM THE POPULAR MUSIC OF POLAND
7447-91187-0016 THEY WERE HIS EARLIEST MODELS ON THEM WERE BUILDED HIS FIRST THEMES
7447-91187-0017 SO CHOPIN GLORIFIED THOSE OF THE POLES THE NATIONAL TONALITY BECAME TO HIM A VEHICLE TO BE FREIGHTED WITH HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TO MY PEOPLE
7447-91187-0018 WHAT UHLAND WAS TO THE GERMANS HE ONCE SAID TO A FRIEND HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE AND IMMORTALIZED ITS JOYS SORROWS AND CAPRICES BY THE FORCE OF HIS SPLENDID ART
7447-91187-0019 THOSE WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INTERPRET HIM AS THE SENTIMENTAL HERO OF MINOR MOODS THE TONE POET IN WHOM THE WEAKNESS OF DESPAIR PREDOMINATES HAVE MISSED THE LEAPING FLAMES THE VIVID INTENSITY
7447-91187-0020 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0021 THAT UPLIFTS AND STRENGTHENS THE TRAVAILING SOUL IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE HAD A SAD HEART BUT A JOYFUL MIND THE TWO TEACHERS OF CHOPIN WERE
7447-91187-0022 ZWYNY A BOHEMIAN VIOLINIST WHO TAUGHT THE PIANO AND JOSEPH ELSNER A VIOLINIST ORGANIST AND THEORIST FROM ZWYNY AND ELSNER EVEN THE GREATEST DUNCE MUST LEARN SOMETHING HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING
7447-91187-0023 NEITHER OF THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO HAMPER HIS FREE GROWTH BY RIGID TECHNICAL RESTRAINTS THEIR GUIDANCE LEFT HIM MASTER OF HIS OWN GENIUS AT LIBERTY TO SOAR LIKE THE LARK INTO THE ETHEREAL BLUE OF THE SKIES
7447-91187-0024 HE RESPECTED THEM BOTH A REVERING AFFECTION WAS CHERISHED BY HIM FOR ELSNER TO WHOM HE OWED HIS SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HIS ART HIS HABITS OF SERIOUS STUDY
7447-91187-0025 AND HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH BACH THERE IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THE FACT THAT THIS PRINCE CHARMING OF THE PIANO WHOSE MAGIC TOUCH AWAKENED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY OF THE INSTRUMENT OF WOOD AND WIRES NEVER HAD A LESSON IN HIS LIFE
7447-91187-0026 FROM A MERE PIANO SPECIALIST LISZT ONCE SAID CHOPIN WAS THE ONLY PIANIST HE EVER KNEW THAT COULD PLAY THE VIOLIN ON THE PIANO IF HE COULD DO SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD HARKENED TO THE VOICE OF THE VIOLIN
7447-91187-0027 AND RESOLVED TO SHOW THAT THE PIANO TOO COULD PRODUCE THRILLING EFFECTS IN THE SAME WAY HE HAD LISTENED TO THE HUMAN VOICE AND DETERMINED THAT THE SONG OF HIS OWN INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE HEARD
7447-91187-0028 THOSE WHO GIVE EAR TO THE PIANO ALONE WILL NEVER LEARN THE SECRET OF CALLING FORTH ITS SUPREME ELOQUENCE WE CAN SEE AND HEAR THIS RAPHAEL OF MUSIC AT THE PIANO
7447-91187-0029 SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
7447-91187-0030 THE MOST UNACCUSTOMED OF HIS COMPLICATED CHROMATIC MODULATIONS WE CAN FEEL HIS INDIVIDUALITY PULSATING THROUGH EVERY TONE EVOKED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALIZED FINGERS OF HIS AS THEY WEAVE MEASURES FOR SYLPHS
7447-91187-0031 WE MARVEL AT HIS SOFTLY WHISPERED YET EVER CLEARLY DISTINCT PIANISSIMO AT THE FULL ROUND TONE OF ITS RELATIVE FORTISSIMO THAT WAS NEVER HARSH OR NOISY
7447-91187-0032 AND AT ALL THE EXQUISITELY GRADED NUANCES THAT LAY BETWEEN WITH THOSE TIME FLUCTUATIONS EXPRESSIVE OF THE EBB AND FLOW OF HIS POETIC INNER BEING
7447-91187-0033 NO WONDER BALZAC MAINTAINED THAT IF CHOPIN SHOULD BUT DRUM ON THE TABLE HIS FINGERS WOULD EVOKE SUBTLE SOUNDING MUSIC AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT FOR TEACHERS DELICATELY STRUNG AS HE WAS
7447-91187-0034 HE MUST OFTEN HAVE ENDURED TORTURES FROM THE BEST OF HIS PUPILS BUT SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE CONSECRATED TO HIS ART THAT HE NEVER FALTERED IN HIS EFFORTS TO LIFT THOSE WHO CONFIDED IN HIM
7447-91187-0035 TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
7447-91187-0036 THE BASIS OF THIS METHOD CONSISTED IN REFINEMENT OF TOUCH FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH A NATURAL EASY POSITION OF THE HAND WAS CONSIDERED BY CHOPIN A PRIME REQUISITE HE PREPARED EACH HAND WITH INFINITE CARE
7447-91187-0037 BEFORE PERMITTING ANY ATTEMPT AT THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL IDEAS IN ORDER TO PLACE IT TO ADVANTAGE HE CAUSED IT TO BE THROWN LIGHTLY ON THE KEYBOARD SO THAT THE FIVE FINGERS RESTED ON THE NOTES E F SHARP G SHARP A SHARP AND B
7447-91187-0038 AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF POSITION REQUIRED THE PRACTICE OF EXERCISES CALCULATED TO INSURE INDEPENDENCE THE PUPIL WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO THROUGH THESE EXERCISES FIRST STACCATO EFFECTED BY A FREE MOVEMENT OF THE WRIST
7447-91187-0039 AN ADMIRABLE MEANS OF COUNTERACTING HEAVINESS AND CLUMSINESS THEN LEGATO STACCATO THEN ACCENTED LEGATO THEN PURE LEGATO
7447-91187-0040 AND THE MOVEMENT FROM ANDANTE TO PRESTISSIMO HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PARTICULAR ABOUT ARPEGGIO WORK AND INSISTED UPON THE REPETITION OF EVERY NOTE AND PASSAGE UNTIL ALL HARSHNESS AND ROUGHNESS OF TONE WERE ELIMINATED
7447-91187-0041 HE NEVER HESITATED ABOUT PLACING IT ON A BLACK KEY WHEN CONVENIENT AND HAD IT PASSED BY MUSCLE ACTION ALONE IN SCALES AND BROKEN CHORDS WHOSE ZEALOUS PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF TOUCH ACCENT RHYTHM AND TONE
7447-91187-0042 WERE DEMANDED BY HIM INDIVIDUALIZATION OF THE FINGERS WAS ONE OF HIS STRONG POINTS AND HE BELIEVED IN ASSIGNING TO EACH OF THEM ITS APPROPRIATE PART IN A GOOD MECHANISM HE SAID
7447-91187-0043 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7447-91187-0044 ONE WHOSE EXQUISITE DELICACY COULD NEVER BE CONFOUNDED WITH FEEBLENESS
7447-91187-0045 AND HE KNEW HOW TO AUGMENT THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF TONE COLORING BY SETTING IN VIBRATION SYMPATHETIC HARMONICS OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTES THROUGH JUDICIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE DAMPER PEDAL
7447-91187-0046 BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED FREQUENT PLAYING OF THE PRELUDES AND FUGUES OF BACH AS A MEANS OF CULTIVATING MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE MUSCULAR INDEPENDENCE AND TOUCH AND TONE DISCRIMINATION HIS MUSICAL HEROES WERE BACH AND MOZART
7447-91187-0047 FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM NATURE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY AND POETRY IN MUSIC AT ONE TIME HE UNDERTOOK TO WRITE A METHOD OR SCHOOL OF PIANO PLAYING BUT NEVER PROGRESSED BEYOND THE OPENING SENTENCES
7447-91187-0048 A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
7447-91187-0049 COULD ADEQUATELY INTERPRET HIS TONE CREATIONS OR MAKE PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE HIS METHOD PUPILS OF HIS AND THEIR PUPILS HAVE FAITHFULLY ENDEAVORED TO TRANSMIT TO THE MUSICAL WORLD THE TRADITION OF HIS INDIVIDUAL STYLE
7447-91187-0050 THE ELECT FEW HAVE COME INTO TOUCH WITH HIS VISION OF BEAUTY BUT IT HAS BEEN MERCILESSLY MISINTERPRETED BY THOUSANDS OF RUTHLESS ASPIRANTS TO MUSICAL HONORS IN THE SCHOOLROOM THE STUDENTS RECITAL AND THE CONCERT HALL
7447-91187-0051 WHOEVER PLAYS CHOPIN WITH SLEDGE HAMMER FINGERS WILL DEADEN ALL SENSE OF HIS POETRY CHARM AND GRACE WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM WITH WEAK SENTIMENTALISM WILL MISS ALTOGETHER HIS DIGNITY AND STRENGTH
7447-91187-0052 IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE WAS WOMAN IN HIS TENDERNESS AND REALIZATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND MAN IN HIS ENERGY AND FORCE OF MIND THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ARTIST AND HUMAN BEING IS THUS REPRESENTED
7447-91187-0053 TO INTERPRET HIM REQUIRES SIMPLICITY PURITY OF STYLE REFINED TECHNIQUE POETIC IMAGINATION AND GENUINE SENTIMENT NOT FITFUL FICTITIOUS SENTIMENTALITY
7447-91187-0054 SERENELY FANCYING THEY ARE HEEDING THE MASTER'S DESIGN RECKLESS OUT OF TIME PLAYING DISFIGURES WHAT IS MEANT TO EXPRESS THE FLUCTUATION OF THOUGHT THE SOUL'S AGITATION THE ROLLING OF THE WAVES OF TIME AND ETERNITY
7447-91187-0055 THE RUBATO FROM RUBARE TO ROB REPRESENTS A PLIABLE MOVEMENT THAT IS CERTAINLY AS OLD AS THE GREEK DRAMA IN DECLAMATION AND WAS EMPLOYED IN INTONING THE GREGORIAN CHANT
7447-91187-0056 INDICATIONS OF IT IN BACH ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED BEETHOVEN USED IT EFFECTIVELY CHOPIN APPROPRIATED IT AS ONE OF HIS MOST POTENT AUXILIARIES IN PLAYING HE EMPHASIZED THE SAYING OF MOZART
7447-91187-0057 ITS LEAVES TREMBLE WITH EVERY BREATH OF THE WIND BUT THE TREE REMAINS UNSHAKEN THAT IS THE RUBATO THERE ARE STORMS TO WHICH EVEN THE TREE YIELDS TO REALIZE THEM TO DIVINE THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE UNDULATING TEMPEST TOSSED RUBATO
7447-91187-0058 REQUIRES HIGHLY MATURED ARTISTIC TASTE AND ABSOLUTE MUSICAL CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE TO ENJOY PLAYING BEFORE MISCELLANEOUS AUDIENCES WHOSE UNSYMPATHETIC CURIOSITY HE DECLARED PARALYZED HIM
7447-91187-0059 CHOPIN WAS AT HIS BEST WHEN INTERPRETING MUSIC IN PRIVATE FOR A CHOICE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OR PUPILS OR WHEN ABSORBED IN COMPOSITION IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY FOR HIM THAT HE USHERED IN A NEW ERA FOR HIS CHOSEN INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0060 SPIRITUALIZING ITS TIMBRE LIBERATING IT FROM TRADITIONAL ORCHESTRAL AND CHORAL EFFECTS AND ELEVATING IT TO AN INDEPENDENT POWER IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC BESIDES ENRICHING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE PIANO HE AUGMENTED THE MATERIALS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION
7447-91187-0061 HARMONY AND RHYTHM NEW CHORD EXTENSIONS PASSAGES OF DOUBLE NOTES ARABESQUES AND HARMONIC COMBINATIONS WERE DEVISED BY HIM
7447-91187-0062 AND HE SO SYSTEMATIZED THE USE OF THE PEDALS THAT THE MOST VARIED NUANCES COULD BE PRODUCED BY THEM IN MELODY AND GENERAL CONCEPTION HIS TONE POEMS SPRANG SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS GLOWING FANCY
7447-91187-0063 BUT THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE MOST SEVERE TESTS BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD EVERY INGENIOUS DEVICE THAT GAVE CHARACTER TO HIS EXQUISITE CANTILENA AND SOFTENED HIS MOST STARTLING CHORD PROGRESSIONS
7447-91187-0064 DISCUSSING THE COMPOSITIONS OF CHOPIN IN HIS DELIGHTFUL AND INSPIRING BOOK CHOPIN THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC CALLS THE STUDIES TITANIC EXPERIMENTS
7447-91187-0065 THE PRELUDES MOODS IN MINIATURE THE NOCTURNES NIGHT AND ITS MELANCHOLY MYSTERIES
7447-91187-0066 FAERY DRAMAS THE POLONAISES HEROIC HYMNS OF BATTLE THE VALSES AND MAZURKAS
7447-91187-0067 TO WRITE OF THE FOUR IMPROMPTUS IN THEIR OWN KEY OF UNRESTRAINED FEELING AND PONDERED INTENTION WOULD NOT BE AS EASY AS RECAPTURING THE FIRST CARELESS RAPTURE OF THE LARK UNQUESTIONABLY
7447-91187-0068 THE POETRY OF CHOPIN IS OF THE MOST EXQUISITE LYRIC CHARACTER HIS LEADERSHIP IS SUPREME SO ORIGINAL WAS HIS CONCEPTION SO FINISHED HIS WORKMANSHIP SO SUBLIME HIS PURPOSE
7447-91187-0069 THAT WE MAY WELL EXCLAIM WITH SCHUMANN HE IS THE BOLDEST PROUDEST POETIC SPIRIT OF THE TIME HIS GREATNESS IS HIS ARISTOCRACY SAYS OSCAR BIE HE STANDS AMONG MUSICIANS IN HIS FAULTLESS VESTURE
3242-67168-0000 I NEVER SELL GOODS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I CAN FIND THEM WHEN I WANT THEM AND IF THESE FELLOWS TRY TO PUT THEIR FOREFEET IN THE TROUGH OR START ANY SHOVING AND CROWDING THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ME FORGETTING MY TABLE MANNERS TOO
3242-67168-0001 FOR WHEN IT COMES TO FUNNY BUSINESS I'M SOMETHING OF A HUMORIST MYSELF AND WHILE I'M TOO OLD TO RUN I'M YOUNG ENOUGH TO STAND AND FIGHT FIRST AND LAST A GOOD MANY MEN HAVE GONE GUNNING FOR ME BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS PLANNED THE OBSEQUIES BEFORE THEY CAUGHT THE DECEASED
3242-67168-0002 I RECKON THERE HASN'T BEEN A TIME IN TWENTY YEARS WHEN THERE WASN'T A NICE GATES AJAR PIECE ALL MADE UP AND READY FOR ME IN SOME OFFICE NEAR THE BOARD OF TRADE BUT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF A QUIET FUNERAL IS A WILLING CORPSE AND I'M STILL SITTING UP AND TAKING NOURISHMENT
3242-67168-0003 ABUSE AND FLATTERY THE FIRST CAN'T HARM YOU AND THE SECOND CAN'T HELP YOU SOME MEN ARE LIKE YELLOW DOGS
3242-67168-0004 LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS BULLING THE MARKET THE LONGS ALL SAID THAT I WAS A KIND HEARTED OLD PHILANTHROPIST WHO WAS LAYING AWAKE NIGHTS SCHEMING TO GET THE FARMERS A TOP PRICE FOR THEIR HOGS
3242-67168-0005 AND THE SHORTS ALLOWED THAT I WAS AN INFAMOUS OLD ROBBER WHO WAS STEALING THE PORK OUT OF THE WORKINGMAN'S POT AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T PLEASE BOTH SIDES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PLEASING YOUR OWN SIDE
3242-67168-0006 I REMEMBER ONCE I HAD A VACANT LOT OUT ON THE AVENUE AND A LADY CAME IN TO MY OFFICE AND IN A SOOTHING SYRUPY WAY ASKED IF I WOULD LEND IT TO HER AS SHE WANTED TO BUILD A CRECHE ON IT I HESITATED A LITTLE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF A CRECHE BEFORE
3242-67168-0007 AND SOMEWAYS IT SOUNDED SORT OF FOREIGN AND FRISKY THOUGH THE WOMAN LOOKED LIKE A GOOD SAFE RELIABLE OLD HEIFER BUT SHE EXPLAINED THAT A CRECHE WAS A BABY FARM WHERE OLD MAIDS WENT TO WASH AND FEED AND STICK PINS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN WHILE THEIR MOTHERS WERE OFF AT WORK
3242-67168-0008 OF COURSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT TO GET OUR PASTOR OR THE POLICE AFTER ME SO I TOLD HER TO GO AHEAD SHE WENT OFF HAPPY BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER SHE DROPPED IN AGAIN LOOKING SORT OF DISSATISFIED TO FIND OUT IF I WOULDN'T BUILD THE CRECHE ITSELF
3242-67168-0009 IT SEEMED LIKE A WORTHY OBJECT SO I SENT SOME CARPENTERS OVER TO KNOCK TOGETHER A LONG FRAME PAVILION SHE WAS MIGHTY GRATEFUL YOU BET AND I DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR A FORTNIGHT THEN SHE CALLED BY TO SAY THAT SO LONG AS I WAS IN THE BUSINESS AND THEY DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING SPECIAL
3242-67168-0010 WOULD I MIND GIVING HER A FEW COWS SHE HAD A SURPRISED AND GRIEVED EXPRESSION ON HER FACE AS SHE TALKED AND THE WAY SHE PUT IT MADE ME FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING THOUGHT OF THE LIVE STOCK MYSELF SO I THREW IN HALF A DOZEN COWS TO PROVIDE THE REFRESHMENTS
3242-67168-0011 TO ASK WHY I HADN'T HAD IT PAINTED I WAS TOO BUSY THAT MORNING TO QUARREL SO I SENT WORD THAT I WOULD FIX IT UP AND WHEN I WAS DRIVING BY THERE NEXT DAY THE PAINTERS WERE HARD AT WORK ON IT
3242-67168-0012 GRAHAM'S EXTRACT IT MAKES THE WEAK STRONG
3242-67168-0013 WENT ALL AROUND TOWN SAYING THAT I HAD GIVEN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SHED TO CHARITY AND PAINTED A THOUSAND DOLLAR AD ON IT ALLOWED I OUGHT TO SEND MY CHECK FOR THAT AMOUNT TO THE CRECHE FUND KEPT AT IT TILL I BEGAN TO THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN IT AFTER ALL AND SENT HER THE MONEY
3242-67168-0014 THEN I FOUND A FELLOW WHO WANTED TO BUILD IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD SOLD HIM THE LOT CHEAP AND GOT OUT OF THE CRECHE INDUSTRY
3242-67168-0015 BUT THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER PUT INTO IT WHICH DIDN'T DRAW DIVIDENDS IN FUN OR DOLLARS WAS WORRY THAT IS A BRANCH OF THE TRADE WHICH YOU WANT TO LEAVE TO OUR COMPETITORS I'VE ALWAYS FOUND WORRYING A BLAMED SIGHT MORE UNCERTAIN THAN HORSE RACING IT'S HARDER TO PICK A WINNER AT IT
3242-67168-0016 YOU GO HOME WORRYING BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOUR FOOL NEW CLERK FORGOT TO LOCK THE SAFE AFTER YOU AND DURING THE NIGHT THE LARD REFINERY BURNS DOWN YOU SPEND A YEAR FRETTING BECAUSE YOU THINK BILL JONES IS GOING TO CUT YOU OUT WITH YOUR BEST GIRL AND THEN YOU SPEND TEN WORRYING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
3242-67168-0017 A BUSY MAN HAS NO TIME TO BOTHER WITH IT HE CAN ALWAYS FIND PLENTY OF OLD WOMEN IN SKIRTS OR TROUSERS TO SPEND THEIR DAYS WORRYING OVER THEIR OWN TROUBLES AND TO SIT UP NIGHTS WAKING HIS SPEAKING OF HANDING OVER YOUR WORRIES TO OTHERS NATURALLY CALLS TO MIND THE WIDOW WILLIAMS AND HER SON BUD
3242-67168-0018 WHO WAS A PLAYMATE OF MINE WHEN I WAS A BOY BUD WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE WIDOW'S TROUBLES AND SHE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE TROUBLES SELDOM CAME SINGLY HAD FOURTEEN ALTOGETHER AND FOUR PAIR OF EM WERE TWINS
3242-67168-0019 AND THEN SHE'D SHED ALL WORRY OVER THEM FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALLOWED THAT IF THEY GOT HURT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BRING THEM HOME
3242-67168-0020 AND SOMEWAYS THE WHOLE DROVE ALWAYS SHOWED UP SAFE AND DIRTY ABOUT MEAL TIME
3242-67168-0021 AND SO WHEN BUD'S CLOTHES WERE FOUND AT THE SWIMMING HOLE ONE DAY AND NO BUD INSIDE THEM SHE DIDN'T TAKE ON UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD BROUGHT THE NEWS AND WHO WERE STANDING AROUND WAITING FOR HER TO GO OFF INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE WAY OF HIGH STRIKES
3242-67168-0022 HINTED THAT THERE'D BE NO FUNERAL OR SUCH LIKE EXPENSIVE GOINGS ON UNTIL SOME ONE PRODUCED THE DECEASED TAKE HER BY AND LARGE SHE WAS A PRETTY COOL CALM CUCUMBER
3242-67168-0023 AND EVERY ONE JUST QUIT WORK TO TELL EACH OTHER WHAT A NOBLE LITTLE FELLOW HE WAS AND HOW HIS MOTHER HADN'T DESERVED TO HAVE SUCH A BRIGHT LITTLE SUNBEAM IN HER HOME AND TO DRAG THE RIVER BETWEEN TALKS BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A RISE
3242-67168-0024 BUT FINALLY AT THE END OF A WEEK WHEN THEY'D STRAINED THE WHOLE RIVER THROUGH THEIR DRAGS AND HADN'T ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BUT A COLLECTION OF TIN CANS AND DEAD CATFISH
3242-67168-0025 AND WENT DOWN THE STREET TO THE CABIN OF LOUISIANA CLYTEMNESTRA AN OLD YELLOW WOMAN WHO WOULD GO INTO A TRANCE FOR FOUR BITS AND FIND A FORTUNE FOR YOU FOR A DOLLAR I RECKON SHE'D HAVE CALLED HERSELF A CLAIRVOYANT NOWADAYS BUT THEN SHE WAS JUST A VOODOO WOMAN
3242-67168-0026 WELL THE WIDOW SAID SHE RECKONED THAT BOYS OUGHT TO BE LET OUT AS WELL AS IN FOR HALF PRICE AND SO SHE LAID DOWN TWO BITS ALLOWING THAT SHE WANTED A FEW MINUTES PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER BUD
3242-67168-0027 CLYTIE SAID SHE'D DO HER BEST BUT THAT SPIRITS WERE MIGHTY SNIFTY AND HIGH TONED EVEN WHEN THEY'D ONLY BEEN POOR WHITE TRASH ON EARTH AND IT MIGHT MAKE THEM MAD TO BE CALLED AWAY FROM THEIR HIGH JINKS IF THEY WERE TAKING A LITTLE RECREATION OR FROM THEIR HIGH PRICED NEW YORK CUSTOMERS IF THEY WERE WORKING
3242-67168-0028 BUT NEXT DAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND PAID DOWN FOUR BITS AND CLYTIE RECKONED THAT THAT OUGHT TO FETCH BUD SURE SOMEWAYS THOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LUCK AND FINALLY THE WIDOW SUGGESTED THAT SHE CALL UP BUD'S FATHER BUCK WILLIAMS HAD BEEN DEAD A MATTER OF TEN YEARS
3242-67168-0029 AND THE OLD MAN RESPONDED PROMPTLY WHERE'S BUD ASKED THE WIDOW
3242-67168-0030 NO THEN HE'D HAVE TO LOOK DOWNSTAIRS FOR HIM CLYTIE TOLD THE WIDOW TO CALL AGAIN AND THEY'D GET HIM SURE SO SHE CAME BACK NEXT DAY AND LAID DOWN A DOLLAR THAT FETCHED OLD BUCK WILLIAMS GHOST ON THE JUMP YOU BET
3242-67168-0031 BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A WHISPER EVEN FROM BUD I RECKON CLYTIE HAD BEEN STRINGING THE OLD LADY ALONG INTENDING TO PRODUCE BUD'S SPOOK AS A SORT OF RED FIRE CALCIUM LIGHT GRAND MARCH OF THE AMAZONS CLIMAX BUT SHE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
3242-67168-0032 FOR RIGHT THERE THE OLD LADY GOT UP WITH A MIGHTY SET EXPRESSION AROUND HER LIPS AND MARCHED OUT MUTTERING THAT IT WAS JUST AS SHE HAD THOUGHT ALL ALONG BUD WASN'T THERE AND WHEN THE NEIGHBORS DROPPED IN THAT AFTERNOON TO PLAN OUT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HER LOST LAMB
3242-67168-0033 SHE CHASED THEM OFF THE LOT WITH A BROOM
3242-67168-0034 AND THAT THEY WOULD JUST STAND PAT NOW AND WAIT FOR HIM TO MAKE THE NEXT MOVE
3242-67168-0035 BUT THERE WOULDN'T BE TILL THEN ALTOGETHER IT LOOKED AS IF THERE WAS A HEAP OF TROUBLE COMING TO BUD IF HE HAD MADE ANY MISTAKE AND WAS STILL ALIVE THE WIDOW FOUND HER LOST LAMB HIDING BEHIND A RAIN BARREL WHEN SHE OPENED UP THE HOUSE NEXT MORNING
3242-67168-0036 AND THERE WAS A MIGHTY TOUCHING AND AFFECTING SCENE IN FACT THE WIDOW MUST HAVE TOUCHED HIM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES AND EVERY TIME HE WAS AFFECTED TO TEARS FOR SHE WAS USING A BED SLAT WHICH IS A POWERFULLY STRONG MORAL AGENT FOR MAKING A BOY SEE THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS
3242-67168-0037 AND IT WAS A MONTH AFTER THAT BEFORE BUD COULD GO DOWN MAIN STREET WITHOUT SOME MAN WHO HAD CALLED HIM A NOBLE LITTLE FELLOW OR A BRIGHT MANLY LITTLE CHAP WHILE HE WAS DROWNED REACHING OUT AND FETCHING HIM A CLIP ON THE EAR FOR HAVING COME BACK AND PUT THE LAUGH ON HIM
3242-67168-0038 BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE LEFT HOME TO GET A FEW INDIAN SCALPS AND THAT HE CAME BACK FOR A LITTLE BACON AND CORN PONE I SIMPLY MENTION THE WIDOW IN PASSING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT THE TIME TO DO YOUR WORRYING IS WHEN A THING IS ALL OVER AND THAT THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBORS
3242-67168-0039 I SAIL FOR HOME TO MORROW
3242-8112-0000 MANTELISH EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT OFF WITH THE MESSENGER THE DOOR CLOSED QUILLAN CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR WE'RE MOVING THE OUTFIT LATER TONIGHT THE COMMISSIONER EXPLAINED
3242-8112-0001 EIGHT TONS OF HIS LAB EQUIPMENT PLUS HIS SPECIAL U LEAGUE GUARDS OH TRIGGER PICKED UP THE PUYA GLASS SHE LOOKED INTO IT IT WAS EMPTY MOVING WHERE SHE ASKED MANON SAID THE COMMISSIONER TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LATER
3242-8112-0002 EVERY LAST MUSCLE IN TRIGGER'S BODY SEEMED TO GO LIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE SETTLED BACK SLIGHTLY IN THE CHAIR SURPRISED BY THE FORCE OF THE REACTION SHE HADN'T REALIZED BY NOW HOW KEYED UP SHE WAS SHE SIGHED A SMALL SIGH
3242-8112-0003 THEN SHE SMILED AT QUILLAN MAJOR SHE SAID HOW ABOUT A TINY LITTLE REFILL ON THAT PUYA ABOUT HALF QUILLAN TOOK CARE OF THE TINY LITTLE REFILL COMMISSIONER TATE SAID BY THE WAY
3242-8112-0004 QUILLAN DOES HAVE A DEGREE IN SUBSPACE ENGINEERING AND GETS ASSIGNED TO THE ENGINEERS NOW AND THEN BUT HIS REAL JOB'S SPACE SCOUT INTELLIGENCE TRIGGER NODDED I'D ALMOST GUESSED IT SHE GAVE QUILLAN ANOTHER SMILE
3242-8112-0005 AND NOW SAID THE COMMISSIONER WE'LL TALK MORE FREELY WE TELL MANTELISH JUST AS LITTLE AS WE CAN TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH TRIGGER THE PROFESSOR IS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP ON AN OPERATION LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S YES SHE SAID
3242-8112-0006 GOING OVER FOR VISITS TO MANTELISH'S GARDEN WITH MY FATHER IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I REMEMBER I CAN IMAGINE HE'S A PROBLEM SHE SHIFTED HER GAZE CURIOUSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO MEN WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING
3242-8112-0007 LOOKING FOR GESS FAYLE AND THE KEY UNIT HOLATI TATE SAID THAT'S ABOUT IT WE'RE ONE OF A FEW THOUSAND FEDERATION GROUPS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME GENERAL JOB EACH GROUP WORKS AT ITS SPECIALTIES AND THE INFORMATION GETS CORRELATED
3242-8112-0008 IN WHAT WAY TRIGGER ASKED WELL SUPPOSE THAT KEY UNIT IS LOST AND STAYS LOST SUPPOSE ALL THE OTHER PLASMOIDS PUT TOGETHER DON'T CONTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SHOW HOW THE OLD GALACTICS PRODUCED THE THINGS AND GOT THEM TO OPERATE
3242-8112-0009 SOMEBODY WOULD GET THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY SOON WOULDN'T THEY
3242-8112-0010 THERE SEEM TO BE TOO MANY BASIC FACTORS MISSING IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF SCIENCES FIRST AND THAT COULD TAKE A FEW CENTURIES WELL TRIGGER ADMITTED I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THE THINGS INDEFINITELY
3242-8112-0011 SAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE FEDERATION AREN'T THERE MORE OR LESS
3242-8112-0012 AND THE NUMBER OF PLANETARY CONFEDERACIES SUBPLANETARY GOVERNMENTS INDUSTRIAL FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL COMBINES ASSORTED POWER GROUPS ET CETERA AND SO ON IS SOMETHING I'D HATE TO HAVE TO CALCULATE WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE ASKED
3242-8112-0013 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
3242-8112-0014 OF COURSE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET VERY UNHAPPY EH THAT SAID COMMISSIONER TATE IS ONLY A LITTLE OF IT YES THE THING ISN'T JUST LOST SOMEBODY'S GOT IT VERY LIKELY TRIGGER NODDED
3242-8112-0015 SO ANY ONE OF UMPTEEN THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE HUB MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT HAS THAT PLASMOID NOW INCLUDING SAID HOLATI ANY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN RESTRICTED WORLDS
3242-8112-0016 THEIR TREATIES OF LIMITATION WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM GET INTO THE PLASMOID PIE UNTIL THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AT IT A DECADE OR SO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EAGER THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE THEN TRIGGER SAID LORDY
3242-8112-0017 THE THING COULD EVEN SET OFF ANOTHER STRING OF WARS THAT'S A POINT THE COUNCIL IS NERVOUS ABOUT HE SAID WELL IT CERTAINLY IS A MESS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE FEDERATION MIGHT HAVE HAD A SECURITY CHIEF IN ON THAT FIRST OPERATION
3242-8112-0018 RIGHT THERE ON HARVEST MOON THEY DID HE SAID IT WAS FAYLE
3242-8112-0019 HOLATI COULD THOSE THINGS EVER BECOME AS VALUABLE AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING IT'S ALL SOUNDED A LITTLE EXAGGERATED TO ME THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D WONDERED ABOUT IT TOO
3242-8112-0020 I'M NOT ENOUGH OF A BIOLOGIST TO MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO IS THAT THEY MIGHT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GAMBLE VERY HIGH FOR A CHANCE TO GET CONTROL OF THE PLASMOID PROCESS
3242-8112-0021 AND WE KNOW DEFINITELY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GAMBLING FOR IT HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE OF LEADS HERE PRETTY SHORT LEADS SO FAR BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET HE NODDED AT THE TABLE
3242-8112-0022 TRIGGER GLANCED DOWN THE PLASMOID LAY THERE SOME INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF HER HAND YOU KNOW SHE SAID UNCOMFORTABLY OLD REPULSIVE MOVED AGAIN WHILE WE WERE TALKING TOWARDS MY HAND SHE DREW THE HAND AWAY
3242-8112-0023 I WAS WATCHING IT MAJOR QUILLAN SAID REASSURINGLY FROM THE END OF THE TABLE
3242-8112-0024 MANTELISH BROUGHT IT BACK TO MACCADON WITH HIM
3242-8112-0025 HE WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN GUESS AT WHAT ITS FUNCTION WAS IT WAS JUST LYING THERE IN A CUBICLE SO HE DID CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT WHILE HE WAITED FOR GESS FAYLE TO SHOW UP
3242-8112-0026 AND LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS FIDGETED AROUND HOPING TO GET THE KIND OF REPORT FROM MANTELISH AND FAYLE THAT MANTELISH THOUGHT THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED THEY WERE WONDERING WHERE FAYLE WAS TOO BUT THEY KNEW FAYLE WAS SECURITY SO THEY DIDN'T LIKE TO GET TOO NOSY
3242-8112-0027 TRIGGER SHOOK HER HEAD WONDERFUL SO
3242-8112-0028 MANTELISH BEGAN TO GET RESULTS WITH IT THE COMMISSIONER SAID ONE EXPERIMENT WAS RATHER STARTLING HE'D BEEN TRYING THAT ELECTRICAL STIMULATION BUSINESS NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED THEN HE TOUCHED THE PLASMOID AND IT FED THE WHOLE CHARGE BACK TO HIM
3242-8112-0029 SHE LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY GOOD FOR REPULSIVE STOOD UP FOR HIS RIGHTS EH MANTELISH GAINED SOME SUCH IMPRESSION ANYWAY HE BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS WITH IT AFTER THAT AND THEN HE LEARNED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT
3242-8112-0030 HE WAS VISITING ANOTHER LAB WHERE THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PLASMOIDS WHICH ACTUALLY MOVED NOW AND THEN
3242-8112-0031 THE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE
3242-8112-0032 RIGHT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LOCATED ANOTHER MOVING PLASMOID
3242-8112-0033 THE BIG ONE INDUCES PLASMOID ACTIVITY THE LITTLE ONE MODIFIES IT
3242-8112-0034 BUT HIS TWO LAB GUARDS AND ONE OF THE RAIDERS WERE KILLED THE OTHERS GOT AWAY GESS FAYLE'S DEFECTION WAS A CERTAINTY BY THEN AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FEDS GOT THERE FAST AND DEAD BRAINED THE RAIDER THEY LEARNED JUST TWO THINGS
3242-8112-0035 ONE HE'D BEEN MIND BLOCKED AND COULDN'T HAVE SPILLED ANY SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION EVEN IF THEY HAD GOT HIM ALIVE THE OTHER ITEM THEY DREW FROM HIS BRAIN WAS A CLEAR IMPRESSION OF THE TARGET OF THE RAID THE PROFESSOR'S PAL HERE UH HUH TRIGGER SAID LOST IN THOUGHT
3242-8112-0036 SHE POKED REPULSIVE LIGHTLY THAT WOULD BE FAYLE AND HIS ASSOCIATES THEN OR SOMEBODY WHO KNEW ABOUT THEM DID THEY WANT TO KILL IT OR GRAB IT THE COMMISSIONER LOOKED AT HER GRAB IT WAS THE DEAD BRAIN REPORT WHY
3242-8112-0037 SO THEY NEED IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KEY UNIT TRIGGER ASKED PROBABLY THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK VERY MUCH BETTER DOESN'T IT QUITE A LITTLE HE SAID THE UNIT MAY NOT WORK
3242-8112-0038 MANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCE
3242-8112-0039 SO TRIGGER SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE TWO THIRDS OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE THIRD RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE HOW MANY OF THE LATER RAIDERS DID YOU CATCH ALL OF THEM SAID THE COMMISSIONER AROUND FORTY
3242-8112-0040 WE GOT THEM DEAD WE GOT THEM ALIVE IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE THEY WERE HIRED HANDS VERY EXPENSIVE HIRED HANDS BUT STILL JUST THAT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW A THING WE COULD USE THE ONES THAT DID KNOW SOMETHING WERE MIND BLOCKED AGAIN
3242-8112-0041 I THOUGHT TRIGGER SAID REFLECTIVELY YOU COULD UN BLOCK SOMEONE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AND IF YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT A YEAR THEY DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHING
3242-8112-0042 THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN TRIGGER ASKED HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS PERSONALLY MORE OR LESS BY ACCIDENT THE COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECOND LEAD THAT'S ME HUH SHE SAID UNHAPPILY YES
3242-8112-0043 WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GRAB ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET WE'RE HOPING WE WILL IN A VERY FEW DAYS IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT
3242-8112-0044 I CAN TELL YOU MOST OF WHAT I KNOW AT THE MOMENT SAID THE COMMISSIONER
3982-182255-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE GREAT FIGHT FOR CLEAN GOVERNMENT
3982-182255-0001 AS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS CITY SAID MISTER NEWBERRY LEANING BACK IN A LEATHER ARMCHAIR AT THE MAUSOLEUM CLUB AND LIGHTING A SECOND CIGAR IT'S ROTTEN THAT'S ALL
3982-182255-0002 ABSOLUTELY ROTTEN ASSENTED MISTER DICK OVEREND RINGING THE BELL FOR A SECOND WHISKEY AND SODA CORRUPT SAID MISTER NEWBERRY BETWEEN TWO PUFFS OF HIS CIGAR FULL OF GRAFT SAID MISTER OVEREND
3982-182255-0003 FLICKING HIS ASHES INTO THE GRATE CROOKED ALDERMEN SAID MISTER NEWBERRY A BUM CITY SOLICITOR SAID MISTER OVEREND AND AN INFERNAL GRAFTER FOR TREASURER YES ASSENTED MISTER NEWBERRY
3982-182255-0004 AND THEN LEANING FORWARDS IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING CAREFULLY ABOUT THE CORRIDORS OF THE CLUB HE SPOKE BEHIND HIS HAND AND SAID AND THE MAYOR'S THE BIGGEST GRAFTER OF THE LOT AND WHAT'S MORE HE ADDED
3982-182255-0005 SINKING HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER THE TIME HAS COME TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT IT FEARLESSLY MISTER OVEREND NODDED IT'S A TYRANNY HE SAID WORSE THAN RUSSIA REJOINED MISTER NEWBERRY
3982-182255-0006 THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN A QUIET CORNER OF THE CLUB IT WAS ON A SUNDAY EVENING
3982-182255-0007 NOT ARGUMENTATIVELY OR WITH ANY HEAT BUT WITH THE REFLECTIVE SADNESS THAT STEALS OVER AN ELDERLY MAN WHEN HE SITS IN THE LEATHER ARMCHAIR OF A COMFORTABLE CLUB SMOKING A GOOD CIGAR AND MUSING ON THE DECADENCE OF THE PRESENT DAY
3982-182255-0008 THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T ANGER THEM IT MERELY GRIEVED THEM THEY COULD REMEMBER BOTH OF THEM HOW DIFFERENT EVERYTHING WAS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG MEN JUST ENTERING ON LIFE
3982-182255-0009 WHEN MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE YOUNG MEN WENT INTO CONGRESS FROM PURE PATRIOTISM THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS GRAFT OR CROOKEDNESS AS THEY BOTH ADMITTED IN THOSE DAYS AND AS FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE
3982-182255-0010 HERE THEIR VOICES WERE ALMOST HUSHED IN AWE WHY WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG THE UNITED STATES SENATE BUT NO NEITHER OF THEM COULD FIND A PHRASE BIG ENOUGH FOR THEIR MEANING THEY MERELY REPEATED
3982-182255-0011 AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND TOOK LONG DRINKS OF WHISKEY AND SODA THEN NATURALLY SPEAKING OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD LED THEM TO TALK OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE
3982-182255-0012 HOW DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURES THAT THEY REMEMBERED AS YOUNG MEN NOT MERELY DIFFERENT IN THE MATTER OF GRAFT BUT DIFFERENT SO MISTER NEWBERRY SAID IN THE CALIBRE OF THE MEN
3982-182255-0013 HE RECALLED HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN AS A BOY OF TWELVE BY HIS FATHER TO HEAR A DEBATE HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT GIANTS HE SAID THAT WAS WHAT THEY WERE IN FACT THE THING WAS MORE LIKE A WITENAGEMOT
3982-182255-0014 THAN A LEGISLATURE HE SAID HE DISTINCTLY RECALLED A MAN WHOSE NAME HE DIDN'T RECOLLECT SPEAKING ON A QUESTION HE DIDN'T JUST REMEMBER WHAT EITHER FOR OR AGAINST
3982-182255-0015 IT THRILLED HIM HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT IT STAYED IN HIS MEMORY AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY BUT AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE HERE MISTER DICK OVEREND SADLY NODDED ASSENT IN ADVANCE TO WHAT HE KNEW WAS COMING
3982-182255-0016 AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE WELL MISTER NEWBERRY HAD HAD HE SAID OCCASION TO VISIT THE STATE CAPITAL A WEEK BEFORE IN CONNECTION WITH A RAILWAY BILL THAT HE WAS TRYING TO THAT IS THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO
3982-182255-0017 FROM SPEAKING OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE LED TO TALK OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND THEY BOTH AGREED AS ABOVE THAT THINGS WERE WORSE THAN IN RUSSIA WHAT SECRETLY IRRITATED THEM BOTH MOST
3982-182255-0018 WAS THAT THEY HAD LIVED AND DONE BUSINESS UNDER THIS INFERNAL CORRUPTION FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AND HADN'T NOTICED IT THEY HAD BEEN TOO BUSY THE FACT WAS THAT THEIR CONVERSATION REFLECTED NOT SO MUCH THEIR OWN ORIGINAL IDEAS
3982-182255-0019 AS A GENERAL WAVE OF FEELING THAT WAS PASSING OVER THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THERE HAD COME A MOMENT QUITE SUDDENLY IT SEEMED WHEN IT OCCURRED TO EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY WAS ROTTEN THE WORD IS A STRONG ONE
3982-182255-0020 BUT IT IS THE ONE THAT WAS USED LOOK AT THE ALDERMEN THEY SAID ROTTEN LOOK AT THE CITY SOLICITOR ROTTEN AND AS FOR THE MAYOR HIMSELF PHEW THE THING CAME LIKE A WAVE
3982-182255-0021 EVERYBODY FELT IT AT ONCE PEOPLE WONDERED HOW ANY SANE INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY COULD TOLERATE THE PRESENCE OF A SET OF CORRUPT SCOUNDRELS LIKE THE TWENTY ALDERMEN OF THE CITY THEIR NAMES IT WAS SAID
3982-182255-0022 WERE SIMPLY A BYWORD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOR RANK CRIMINAL CORRUPTION THIS WAS SAID SO WIDELY THAT EVERYBODY STARTED HUNTING THROUGH THE DAILY PAPERS TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO IN BLAZES WERE ALDERMEN ANYHOW
3982-182255-0023 AND AS A MATTER OF FACT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THIS WAVE OF FEELING STRUCK THE CITY NOBODY KNEW OR CARED WHO WERE ALDERMEN ANYWAY TO TELL THE TRUTH THE ALDERMEN HAD BEEN MUCH THE SAME PERSONS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS SOME WERE IN THE PRODUCE BUSINESS
3982-182255-0024 OTHERS WERE BUTCHERS TWO WERE GROCERS AND ALL OF THEM WORE BLUE CHECKERED WAISTCOATS AND RED TIES AND GOT UP AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING TO ATTEND THE VEGETABLE AND OTHER MARKETS NOBODY HAD EVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THEM THAT IS TO SAY NOBODY ON PLUTORIA AVENUE
3982-182255-0025 SOMETIMES ONE SAW A PICTURE IN THE PAPER AND WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHO THE PERSON WAS BUT ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND NOTICING WHAT WAS WRITTEN UNDER IT ONE SAID OH I SEE AN ALDERMAN AND TURNED TO SOMETHING ELSE WHOSE FUNERAL IS THAT
3982-182255-0026 A MAN WOULD SOMETIMES ASK ON PLUTORIA AVENUE OH JUST ONE OF THE CITY ALDERMEN
3982-182255-0027 OH I SEE I BEG YOUR PARDON I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SOMEBODY IMPORTANT
3982-182255-0028 HOW AND WHERE THIS MOVEMENT OF INDIGNATION HAD STARTED PEOPLE SAID THAT IT WAS PART OF A NEW WAVE OF PUBLIC MORALITY THAT WAS SWEEPING OVER THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY IT WAS BEING REMARKED IN ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE COUNTRY
3982-182255-0029 CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS WERE ATTRIBUTING ITS ORIGIN TO THE NEW VIGOUR AND THE FRESH IDEALS OF THE MIDDLE WEST IN BOSTON IT WAS SAID TO BE DUE TO A REVIVAL OF THE GRAND OLD NEW ENGLAND SPIRIT IN PHILADELPHIA
3982-182255-0030 THEY CALLED IT THE SPIRIT OF WILLIAM PENN IN THE SOUTH IT WAS SAID TO BE THE REASSERTION OF SOUTHERN CHIVALRY MAKING ITSELF FELT AGAINST THE GREED AND SELFISHNESS OF THE NORTH WHILE IN THE NORTH THEY RECOGNIZED IT AT ONCE
3982-182255-0031 AS A PROTEST AGAINST THE SLUGGISHNESS AND IGNORANCE OF THE SOUTH IN THE WEST THEY SPOKE OF IT AS A REVOLT AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE EAST AND IN THE EAST THEY CALLED IT A REACTION AGAINST THE LAWLESSNESS OF THE WEST BUT EVERYWHERE THEY HAILED IT AS A NEW SIGN OF THE GLORIOUS
3982-182255-0032 UNITY OF THE COUNTRY IF THEREFORE MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER OVEREND WERE FOUND TO BE DISCUSSING THE CORRUPT STATE OF THEIR CITY THEY ONLY SHARED IN THE NATIONAL SENTIMENTS OF THE MOMENT IN FACT IN THE SAME CITY HUNDREDS OF OTHER CITIZENS
3982-182255-0033 AS DISINTERESTED AS THEMSELVES WERE WAKING UP TO THE REALIZATION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AS SOON AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO LOOK INTO THE CONDITION OF THINGS IN THE CITY THEY WERE HORRIFIED AT WHAT THEY FOUND IT WAS DISCOVERED FOR EXAMPLE
3982-182255-0034 IN A CITY WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEATHS A WEEK AND SOMETIMES EVEN BETTER AN UNDERTAKER SAT ON THE COUNCIL A CITY THAT WAS ABOUT TO EXPROPRIATE LAND AND TO SPEND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A NEW CEMETERY HAD AN UNDERTAKER
3982-182255-0035 ON THE EXPROPRIATION COMMITTEE ITSELF AND WORSE THAN THAT ALDERMAN UNDERCUTT WAS A BUTCHER IN A CITY THAT CONSUMED A THOUSAND TONS OF MEAT EVERY WEEK AND ALDERMAN O'HOOLIGAN IT LEAKED OUT WAS AN IRISHMAN
3982-182255-0036 IMAGINE IT AN IRISHMAN SITTING ON THE POLICE COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL IN A CITY WHERE THIRTY EIGHT AND A HALF OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED POLICEMEN WERE IRISH EITHER BY BIRTH OR PARENTAGE THE THING WAS MONSTROUS SO
3982-182255-0037 WHEN MISTER NEWBERRY SAID IT'S WORSE THAN RUSSIA HE MEANT IT EVERY WORD NOW JUST AS MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE FINISHING THEIR DISCUSSION THE HUGE BULKY FORM OF MAYOR MC GRATH CAME PONDEROUSLY PAST THEM AS THEY SAT
3982-182255-0038 HE LOOKED AT THEM SIDEWAYS OUT OF HIS EYES HE HAD EYES LIKE PLUMS IN A MOTTLED FACE AND BEING A BORN POLITICIAN HE KNEW BY THE VERY LOOK OF THEM THAT THEY WERE TALKING OF SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE TALKING ABOUT BUT
3982-182255-0039 BEING A POLITICIAN HE MERELY SAID GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN WITHOUT A SIGN OF DISTURBANCE GOOD EVENING MISTER MAYOR SAID MISTER NEWBERRY RUBBING HIS HANDS FEEBLY TOGETHER AND SPEAKING IN AN
3982-182255-0040 INGRATIATING TONE THERE IS NO MORE PITIABLE SPECTACLE THAN AN HONEST MAN CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF SPEAKING BOLDLY AND FEARLESSLY OF THE EVIL DOER GOOD EVENING MISTER MAYOR ECHOED MISTER DICK OVEREND ALSO RUBBING HIS HANDS
3982-182255-0041 WARM EVENING IS IT NOT THE MAYOR GAVE NO OTHER ANSWER THAN THAT DEEP GUTTURAL GRUNT WHICH IS TECHNICALLY KNOWN IN MUNICIPAL INTERVIEWS AS REFUSING TO COMMIT ONESELF DID HE HEAR
3982-182255-0042 WHISPERED MISTER NEWBERRY AS THE MAYOR PASSED OUT OF THE CLUB I DON'T CARE IF HE DID WHISPERED MISTER DICK OVEREND HALF AN HOUR LATER MAYOR MC GRATH ENTERED THE PREMISES OF THE THOMAS JEFFERSON CLUB
3982-182255-0043 WHICH WAS SITUATED IN THE REAR END OF A SALOON AND POOL ROOM FAR DOWN IN THE TOWN BOYS HE SAID TO ALDERMAN O'HOOLIGAN AND ALDERMAN GORFINKEL WHO WERE PLAYING FREEZE OUT POKER IN A CORNER BEHIND THE POOL TABLES
3982-182255-0044 YOU WANT TO LET THE BOYS KNOW TO KEEP PRETTY DARK AND GO EASY THERE'S A LOT OF TALK I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE ELECTIONS GOING ROUND THE TOWN LET THE BOYS KNOW THAT JUST FOR A WHILE THE DARKER THEY KEEP THE BETTER WHEREUPON THE WORD WAS PASSED
3982-182255-0045 FROM THE THOMAS JEFFERSON CLUB TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON CLUB AND THENCE TO THE EUREKA CLUB COLOURED AND TO THE KOSSUTH CLUB HUNGARIAN AND TO VARIOUS OTHER CENTRES OF CIVIC PATRIOTISM IN THE LOWER PARTS OF THE CITY
1040-133433-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN WHEN WENDY GREW UP I HOPE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THE OTHER BOYS THEY WERE WAITING BELOW TO GIVE WENDY TIME TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD COUNTED FIVE HUNDRED THEY WENT UP
1040-133433-0001 THEY WENT UP BY THE STAIR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE A BETTER IMPRESSION THEY STOOD IN A ROW IN FRONT OF MISSUS DARLING WITH THEIR HATS OFF AND WISHING THEY WERE NOT WEARING THEIR PIRATE CLOTHES THEY SAID NOTHING BUT THEIR EYES ASKED HER TO HAVE THEM
1040-133433-0002 BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT HIM OF COURSE MISSUS DARLING SAID AT ONCE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THEM BUT MISTER DARLING WAS CURIOUSLY DEPRESSED AND THEY SAW THAT HE CONSIDERED SIX A RATHER LARGE NUMBER I MUST SAY HE SAID TO WENDY
1040-133433-0003 THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS BY HALVES A GRUDGING REMARK WHICH THE TWINS THOUGHT WAS POINTED AT THEM THE FIRST TWIN WAS THE PROUD ONE AND HE ASKED FLUSHING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL SIR BECAUSE IF SO WE CAN GO AWAY
1040-133433-0004 FATHER WENDY CRIED SHOCKED BUT STILL THE CLOUD WAS ON HIM HE KNEW HE WAS BEHAVING UNWORTHILY BUT HE COULD NOT HELP IT WE COULD LIE DOUBLED UP SAID NIBS I ALWAYS CUT THEIR HAIR MYSELF SAID WENDY
1040-133433-0005 GEORGE MISSUS DARLING EXCLAIMED PAINED TO SEE HER DEAR ONE SHOWING HIMSELF IN SUCH AN UNFAVOURABLE LIGHT THEN HE BURST INTO TEARS AND THE TRUTH CAME OUT HE WAS AS GLAD TO HAVE THEM AS SHE WAS HE SAID
1040-133433-0006 BUT HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIS CONSENT AS WELL AS HERS
1040-133433-0007 I DON'T THINK HE IS A CYPHER TOOTLES CRIED INSTANTLY DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER CURLY NO I DON'T DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER SLIGHTLY RATHER NOT TWIN WHAT DO YOU THINK
1040-133433-0008 IT TURNED OUT THAT NOT ONE OF THEM THOUGHT HIM A CYPHER AND HE WAS ABSURDLY GRATIFIED AND SAID HE WOULD FIND SPACE FOR THEM ALL IN THE DRAWING ROOM IF THEY FITTED IN WE'LL FIT IN SIR THEY ASSURED HIM THEN FOLLOW THE LEADER HE CRIED GAILY
1040-133433-0009 MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
1040-133433-0010 BUT AT ANY RATE THEY FOUND CORNERS AND THEY ALL FITTED IN AS FOR PETER HE SAW WENDY ONCE AGAIN BEFORE HE FLEW AWAY HE DID NOT EXACTLY COME TO THE WINDOW BUT HE BRUSHED AGAINST IT IN PASSING SO THAT SHE COULD OPEN IT IF SHE LIKED AND CALL TO HIM
1040-133433-0011 THAT IS WHAT SHE DID HULLO WENDY GOOD BYE HE SAID OH DEAR ARE YOU GOING AWAY YES YOU DON'T FEEL PETER SHE SAID FALTERINGLY
1040-133433-0012 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING TO MY PARENTS ABOUT A VERY SWEET SUBJECT NO ABOUT ME PETER NO MISSUS DARLING CAME TO THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0013 WOULD YOU SEND ME TO SCHOOL HE INQUIRED CRAFTILY YES AND THEN TO AN OFFICE I SUPPOSE SO
1040-133433-0014 VERY SOON I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN SOLEMN THINGS HE TOLD HER PASSIONATELY I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAN O WENDY'S MOTHER IF I WAS TO WAKE UP AND FEEL THERE WAS A BEARD PETER SAID WENDY THE COMFORTER I SHOULD LOVE YOU IN A BEARD
1040-133433-0015 AND MISSUS DARLING STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS TO HIM BUT HE REPULSED HER KEEP BACK LADY
1040-133433-0016 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE WITH TINK IN THE HOUSE WE BUILT FOR WENDY THE FAIRIES ARE TO PUT IT HIGH UP AMONG THE TREE TOPS WHERE THEY SLEEP AT NIGHTS HOW LOVELY CRIED WENDY SO LONGINGLY THAT MISSUS DARLING TIGHTENED HER GRIP I THOUGHT ALL THE FAIRIES WERE DEAD MISSUS DARLING SAID
1040-133433-0017 BECAUSE YOU SEE WHEN A NEW BABY LAUGHS FOR THE FIRST TIME A NEW FAIRY IS BORN AND AS THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW BABIES THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW FAIRIES THEY LIVE IN NESTS ON THE TOPS OF TREES AND THE MAUVE ONES ARE BOYS AND THE WHITE ONES ARE GIRLS AND THE BLUE ONES ARE JUST LITTLE SILLIES WHO ARE NOT SURE WHAT THEY ARE
1040-133433-0018 I SHALL HAVE TINK TINK CAN'T GO A TWENTIETH PART OF THE WAY ROUND SHE REMINDED HIM A LITTLE TARTLY
1040-133433-0019 TINK CALLED OUT FROM SOMEWHERE ROUND THE CORNER IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER SAID O PETER YOU KNOW IT MATTERS
1040-133433-0020 MAY I MUMMY CERTAINLY NOT I HAVE GOT YOU HOME AGAIN AND I MEAN TO KEEP YOU BUT HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER SO DO YOU MY LOVE OH ALL RIGHT PETER SAID AS IF HE HAD ASKED HER FROM POLITENESS MERELY
1040-133433-0021 LONG IN COMING BUT THIS PROMISE SENT PETER AWAY QUITE GAY AGAIN
1040-133433-0022 I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE WENDY KNEW THIS THAT HER LAST WORDS TO HIM WERE THESE RATHER PLAINTIVE ONES YOU WON'T FORGET ME PETER WILL YOU BEFORE SPRING CLEANING TIME COMES OF COURSE PETER PROMISED AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY HE TOOK MISSUS DARLING'S KISS WITH HIM
1040-133433-0023 THE KISS THAT HAD BEEN FOR NO ONE ELSE PETER TOOK QUITE EASILY FUNNY BUT SHE SEEMED SATISFIED OF COURSE ALL THE BOYS WENT TO SCHOOL
1040-133433-0024 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW AND SOON THEY SETTLED DOWN TO BEING AS ORDINARY AS YOU OR ME OR JENKINS MINOR
1040-133433-0025 IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
1040-133433-0026 THOUGH THEY JEERED AT HIM SO HE WAS WITH WENDY WHEN PETER CAME FOR HER AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR SHE FLEW AWAY WITH PETER IN THE FROCK SHE HAD WOVEN FROM LEAVES AND BERRIES IN THE NEVERLAND AND HER ONE FEAR WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOTICE HOW SHORT IT HAD BECOME BUT HE NEVER NOTICED HE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIMSELF
1040-133433-0027 SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THRILLING TALKS WITH HIM ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT NEW ADVENTURES HAD CROWDED THE OLD ONES FROM HIS MIND WHO IS CAPTAIN HOOK
1040-133433-0028 WHEN SHE SPOKE OF THE ARCH ENEMY DON'T YOU REMEMBER SHE ASKED AMAZED HOW YOU KILLED HIM AND SAVED ALL OUR LIVES I FORGET THEM AFTER I KILL THEM HE REPLIED CARELESSLY WHEN SHE EXPRESSED A DOUBTFUL HOPE THAT TINKER BELL WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER HE SAID
1040-133433-0029 WHO IS TINKER BELL O PETER SHE SAID SHOCKED BUT EVEN WHEN SHE EXPLAINED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THERE ARE SUCH A LOT OF THEM HE SAID I EXPECT SHE IS NO MORE I EXPECT HE WAS RIGHT FOR FAIRIES DON'T LIVE LONG
1040-133433-0030 BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE THAT A SHORT TIME SEEMS A GOOD WHILE TO THEM WENDY WAS PAINED TOO TO FIND THAT THE PAST YEAR WAS BUT AS YESTERDAY TO PETER
1040-133433-0031 BUT HE WAS EXACTLY AS FASCINATING AS EVER AND THEY HAD A LOVELY SPRING CLEANING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE TREE TOPS NEXT YEAR HE DID NOT COME FOR HER SHE WAITED IN A NEW FROCK BECAUSE THE OLD ONE SIMPLY WOULD NOT MEET BUT HE NEVER CAME
1040-133433-0032 PERHAPS HE IS ILL MICHAEL SAID YOU KNOW HE IS NEVER ILL MICHAEL CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED WITH A SHIVER PERHAPS THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WENDY AND THEN WENDY WOULD HAVE CRIED IF MICHAEL HAD NOT BEEN CRYING
1040-133433-0033 PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
1040-133433-0034 AND SHE FELT SHE WAS UNTRUE TO HIM WHEN SHE GOT A PRIZE FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE BUT THE YEARS CAME AND WENT WITHOUT BRINGING THE CARELESS BOY AND WHEN THEY MET AGAIN WENDY WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND PETER WAS NO MORE TO HER
1040-133433-0035 THAN A LITTLE DUST IN THE BOX IN WHICH SHE HAD KEPT HER TOYS WENDY WAS GROWN UP YOU NEED NOT BE SORRY FOR HER SHE WAS ONE OF THE KIND THAT LIKES TO GROW UP IN THE END SHE GREW UP OF HER OWN FREE WILL A DAY QUICKER THAN OTHER GIRLS
1040-133433-0036 ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
1040-133433-0037 YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
1040-133433-0038 AND ALWAYS HAD AN ODD INQUIRING LOOK
1040-133433-0039 WHEN SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO ASK THEM THEY WERE MOSTLY ABOUT PETER PAN SHE LOVED TO HEAR OF PETER AND WENDY TOLD HER ALL SHE COULD REMEMBER IN THE VERY NURSERY FROM WHICH THE FAMOUS FLIGHT HAD TAKEN PLACE
1040-133433-0040 WHO WAS NO LONGER FOND OF STAIRS MISSUS DARLING WAS NOW DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE NURSERY NOW JANE'S AND HER NURSE'S AND THERE WAS NO KENNEL FOR NANA ALSO HAD PASSED AWAY
1040-133433-0041 SHE DIED OF OLD AGE AND AT THE END SHE HAD BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET ON WITH BEING VERY FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT NO ONE KNEW HOW TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN EXCEPT HERSELF ONCE A WEEK JANE'S NURSE HAD HER EVENING OFF
1040-133433-0042 AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
1040-133433-0043 I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE
1040-133433-0044 THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO SWEETHEART SAYS WENDY AH ME HOW TIME FLIES DOES IT FLY ASKS THE ARTFUL CHILD THE WAY YOU FLEW WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
1040-133433-0045 WHY CAN'T YOU FLY NOW MOTHER BECAUSE I AM GROWN UP DEAREST WHEN PEOPLE GROW UP THEY FORGET THE WAY WHY DO THEY FORGET THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0046 IT IS ONLY THE GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS WHO CAN FLY WHAT IS GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0047 OR PERHAPS WENDY ADMITS SHE DOES SEE SOMETHING I DO BELIEVE SHE SAYS THAT IT IS THIS NURSERY I DO BELIEVE IT IS SAYS JANE GO ON
1040-133433-0048 THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW
1040-133433-0049 YOU HAVE MISSED A BIT INTERRUPTS JANE WHO NOW KNOWS THE STORY BETTER THAN HER MOTHER WHEN YOU SAW HIM SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAT UP IN BED AND I SAID BOY WHY ARE YOU CRYING
1040-133433-0050 YES THAT WAS IT SAYS JANE WITH A BIG BREATH AND THEN HE FLEW US ALL AWAY TO THE NEVERLAND AND THE FAIRIES AND THE PIRATES AND THE REDSKINS AND THE MERMAID'S LAGOON
1040-133433-0051 YES WHICH DID YOU LIKE BEST OF ALL I THINK I LIKED THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND BEST OF ALL
1040-133433-0052 WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
1040-133433-0053 WENDY SAID IT WITH A SMILE SHE WAS AS GROWN UP AS THAT WHAT DID HIS CROW SOUND LIKE JANE ASKED ONE EVENING IT WAS LIKE THIS WENDY SAID
1040-133433-0054 TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
1040-133433-0055 JANE SAID AH YES MANY GIRLS HEAR IT WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD IT AWAKE LUCKY YOU SAID JANE AND THEN ONE NIGHT CAME THE TRAGEDY IT WAS THE SPRING OF THE YEAR
1040-133433-0056 WENDY WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRE SO AS TO SEE TO DARN FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT IN THE NURSERY AND WHILE SHE SAT DARNING SHE HEARD A CROW THEN THE WINDOW BLEW OPEN AS OF OLD
1040-133433-0057 HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVER AND WENDY SAW AT ONCE THAT HE STILL HAD ALL HIS FIRST TEETH HE WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SHE WAS GROWN UP SHE HUDDLED BY THE FIRE NOT DARING TO MOVE HELPLESS AND GUILTY
1040-133433-0058 A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER
1040-133433-0059 SHE REPLIED FAINTLY SQUEEZING HERSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE SOMETHING INSIDE HER WAS CRYING WOMAN WOMAN LET GO OF ME HULLO WHERE IS JOHN HE ASKED SUDDENLY MISSING THE THIRD BED
1040-133433-0060 JOHN IS NOT HERE NOW SHE GASPED IS MICHAEL ASLEEP HE ASKED WITH A CARELESS GLANCE AT JANE
1040-133433-0061 THAT IS NOT MICHAEL SHE SAID QUICKLY LEST A JUDGMENT SHOULD FALL ON HER PETER LOOKED HULLO IS IT A NEW ONE YES BOY OR GIRL GIRL NOW SURELY HE WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1040-133433-0062 PETER SHE SAID FALTERING ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO FLY AWAY WITH YOU OF COURSE THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME HE ADDED A LITTLE STERNLY HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT THIS IS SPRING CLEANING TIME
1040-133433-0063 SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY THAT HE HAD LET MANY SPRING CLEANING TIMES PASS I CAN'T COME SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY I'LL SOON TEACH YOU AGAIN O PETER DON'T WASTE THE FAIRY DUST ON ME
1040-133433-0064 WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
1040-133433-0065 FOR ALMOST THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT I KNOW OF PETER WAS AFRAID DON'T TURN UP THE LIGHT HE CRIED SHE LET HER HANDS PLAY IN THE HAIR OF THE TRAGIC BOY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE GIRL HEART BROKEN ABOUT HIM
1040-133433-0066 SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN SMILING AT IT ALL
1040-133433-0067 THEN SHE TURNED UP THE LIGHT AND PETER SAW HE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND WHEN THE TALL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE STOOPED TO LIFT HIM IN HER ARMS HE DREW BACK SHARPLY WHAT IS IT HE CRIED AGAIN SHE HAD TO TELL HIM
1040-133433-0068 I AM OLD PETER I AM EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN TWENTY I GREW UP LONG AGO YOU PROMISED NOT TO I COULDN'T HELP IT
1040-133433-0069 NO YOU'RE NOT YES AND THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE BED IS MY BABY NO SHE'S NOT
1040-133433-0070 OF COURSE HE DID NOT STRIKE
1040-133433-0071 AND WENDY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO COMFORT HIM THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO EASILY ONCE SHE WAS ONLY A WOMAN NOW AND SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM TO TRY TO THINK PETER CONTINUED TO CRY AND SOON HIS SOBS WOKE JANE
1040-133433-0072 BOY SHE SAID WHY ARE YOU CRYING PETER ROSE AND BOWED TO HER AND SHE BOWED TO HIM FROM THE BED HULLO HE SAID HULLO SAID JANE MY NAME IS PETER PAN HE TOLD HER
1040-133433-0073 YES I KNOW I CAME BACK FOR MY MOTHER HE EXPLAINED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEVERLAND YES I KNOW JANE SAID I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WHEN WENDY RETURNED DIFFIDENTLY SHE FOUND PETER SITTING ON THE BED POST CROWING GLORIOUSLY
1040-133433-0074 WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
1040-133433-0075 HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER JANE SAID YES I KNOW WENDY ADMITTED RATHER FORLORNLY NO ONE KNOWS IT SO WELL AS I GOOD BYE SAID PETER TO WENDY AND HE ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE SHAMELESS JANE ROSE WITH HIM
1040-133433-0076 IT WAS ALREADY HER EASIEST WAY OF MOVING ABOUT WENDY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW NO NO SHE CRIED IT IS JUST FOR SPRING CLEANING TIME JANE SAID HE WANTS ME ALWAYS TO DO HIS SPRING CLEANING
1040-133433-0077 IF ONLY I COULD GO WITH YOU WENDY SIGHED YOU SEE YOU CAN'T FLY SAID JANE OF COURSE IN THE END WENDY LET THEM FLY AWAY TOGETHER
1040-133433-0078 OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0079 AS YOU LOOK AT WENDY YOU MAY SEE HER HAIR BECOMING WHITE AND HER FIGURE LITTLE AGAIN FOR ALL THIS HAPPENED LONG AGO
1040-133433-0080 AND EVERY SPRING CLEANING TIME EXCEPT WHEN HE FORGETS PETER COMES FOR MARGARET AND TAKES HER TO THE NEVERLAND WHERE SHE TELLS HIM STORIES ABOUT HIMSELF TO WHICH HE LISTENS EAGERLY WHEN MARGARET GROWS UP SHE WILL HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS TO BE PETER'S MOTHER IN TURN
3240-131232-0000 THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001 BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0002 SO THEN THAT THE TURTLE AND THE PIECE OF ALABASTER MAY HAVE HAD FAR DIFFERENT ORIGINS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS PERHAPS HAVE ENTERED A REGION OF SUSPENSION OVER THIS EARTH WAFTING NEAR EACH OTHER LONG DURATION
3240-131232-0003 FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0005 QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007 RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0008 BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
3240-131232-0009 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0011 THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
3240-131232-0012 THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0014 BEFORE WE TAKE UP AN ESPECIAL EXPRESSION UPON THE FALL OF IMMATURE AND LARVAL FORMS OF LIFE TO THIS EARTH AND THE NECESSITY THEN OF CONCEIVING OF SOME FACTOR BESIDES MERE STATIONARINESS OR SUSPENSION OR STAGNATION
3240-131232-0015 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016 THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0017 NONE SEEN TO FALL BY THE WRITER OF THIS ACCOUNT SNAILS SAID TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THIS DISTRICT
3240-131232-0018 OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019 IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0020 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023 AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026 THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029 RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0030 BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032 AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0033 STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0036 RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038 FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
3240-131232-0039 FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040 ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
7190-90543-0000 HOWEVER OBSCURE A MYSTERY MAY BE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME POINT OR CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IF RIGHTLY INTERPRETED WILL LEAD TO ITS SOLUTION EVEN IN THOSE CRIMES WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN ELUCIDATED THIS POINT EXISTS ONLY IT HAS NEVER BEEN DULY APPRECIATED
7190-90543-0001 FOR WHICH THE DETECTIVE FIRST LOOKS AND SINCE FEW CRIMES IF ANY ARE COMMITTED WITHOUT SOME DEFINITE REASON IT IS MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND IN THE MOTIVE HIS ALMOST SUPERHUMAN POWER OF RECOGNIZING THIS KEY CLEW WAS THE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTOPHER QUARLES'S SUCCESS
7190-90543-0002 AND HIS SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS BURGLARIES WHICH CAUSED SUCH SPECULATION FOR A TIME WAS NOT THE LEAST OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD THE EMINENT PHYSICIAN OF HARLEY STREET HAD GIVEN A SMALL DINNER PARTY ONE EVENING THE GUESTS LEFT EARLY
7190-90543-0003 AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED NEITHER SIR JOSEPH NOR LADY MAYNARD NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS WERE DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT BURGLARS HAD ENTERED THEY HAD GOT IN BY A PASSAGE WINDOW AT THE BACK
7190-90543-0004 NOT A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER AND HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO THE DINING ROOM AND HELPED THEMSELVES TO SPIRITS FROM A TANTALUS WHICH WAS ON THE SIDEBOARD THREE GLASSES WITH A LITTLE OF THE LIQUOR LEFT IN THEM WERE ON THE TABLE AND NEAR THEM WERE SOME BISCUIT CRUMBS
7190-90543-0005 THERE WERE SEVERAL SILVER ARTICLES ON THE SIDEBOARD BUT THESE HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED THE BURGLARS APPEARED TO HAVE GIVEN ALL THEIR ATTENTION TO SIR JOSEPH'S ROOM WHICH WAS IN A STATE OF CONFUSION TWO CUPBOARDS AND EVERY DRAWER HAD BEEN TURNED OUT AND THE CONTENTS THROWN ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7190-90543-0006 BUT OF AN OLD FASHIONED TYPE PRESENTING LITTLE DIFFICULTY TO EXPERTS IN IT BESIDES PAPERS AND ABOUT SEVENTY POUNDS IN GOLD IN A CANVAS BAG
7190-90543-0007 PRESENTATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM AND SOME UNIQUE SPECIMENS OF THE QUEEN ANNE PERIOD ALL THIS SILVER WAS UPON THE FLOOR ALSO THE BAG OF MONEY INTACT
7190-90543-0008 IT LOOKED AS IF THE BOX HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND TRODDEN ON BY MISTAKE FOR THE COUNTERS WERE IN A LITTLE HEAP CLOSE TO THE BROKEN FRAGMENTS IT APPEARED THAT THE BURGLARS MUST HAVE BEEN DISTURBED AND HAD MADE OFF WITHOUT SECURING THEIR BOOTY
7190-90543-0009 THIS WAS THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION BUT IT DID NOT SATISFY ME I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HAD HE ANY DOCUMENT WHICH FOR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC REASONS SOMEONE MIGHT BE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HE SAID HE HAD NOT
7190-90543-0010 WAS INCLINED TO LAUGH AT MY QUESTION AND PROCEEDED TO INFORM ME THAT HE HAD NO FAMILY SKELETON
7190-90543-0011 HAD NEVER BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ANY MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY
7190-90543-0012 BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS AGAINST THIS IDEA NO ONE HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT
7190-90543-0013 THE SILVER ON THE FLOOR WAS SCATTERED
7190-90543-0014 AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE CARELESSLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT WHAT THE THIEVES WERE IN SEARCH OF AND SURELY HAD THEY LEFT IN A HURRY THE BAG OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
7190-90543-0015 MOREOVER THE CIGARETTE ENDS AND THE DIRTY GLASSES SUGGESTED A CERTAIN LEISURELY METHOD OF GOING TO WORK AND MEN OF THIS KIND WOULD NOT BE EASILY FRIGHTENED THE CIGARETTE ENDS PUZZLED ME THEY WERE OF A CHEAP AMERICAN BRAND
7190-90543-0016 HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN FROM SIR JOSEPH'S BOX WHICH CONTAINED ONLY TURKISH ONES AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD APPARENTLY BEEN THROWN DOWN CARELESSLY THERE WAS NO ASH UPON THE CARPET NOR ANYWHERE ELSE
7190-90543-0017 IF MY IDEA WERE CORRECT IT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY HAD BEEN PUT THERE ON PURPOSE TO MISLEAD I EXAMINED THE THREE GLASSES ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE THERE WAS THE STAIN OF LIPS AT THE RIM OF ONE BUT NOT OF THE OTHER TWO ONLY ONE HAD BEEN DRUNK OUT OF
7190-90543-0018 AND PROBABLY A LITTLE OF THE LIQUID HAD BEEN EMPTIED OUT OF THIS INTO THE OTHER TWO ON INQUIRY ONE OF THE SERVANTS TOLD ME THAT ONLY A VERY LITTLE OF THE SPIRIT HAD BEEN TAKEN SHE ALSO SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE BISCUIT LEFT IN THE BOX LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS THERE NOW
7190-90543-0019 BY DOING SO I CERTAINLY SAVED ONE VALUABLE LIFE POSSIBLY MORE THAN ONE THAT HE WAS INTERESTED WAS SHOWN BY OUR ADJOURNMENT TO THE EMPTY ROOM
7190-90543-0020 HE SAID I THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE BURGLAR BUT FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD BE BELIEVED THERE WERE MORE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND A REASONABLE CONCLUSION I FANCY SAID QUARLES IF YOU ARE RIGHT IT NARROWS THE SPHERE OF INQUIRY
7190-90543-0021 NARROWS IT VERY MUCH TAKEN WITH THE OTHER FACTS OF THE CASE EXACTLY I ANSWERED THERE IS A SUGGESTION TO MY MIND OF AMATEURISHNESS IN THE AFFAIR I GRANT THE SAFE WAS NOT A DIFFICULT ONE TO BREAK OPEN BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE IN A VERY EXPERT MANNER
7190-90543-0022 THE CIGARETTE ENDS THE DIRTY GLASSES AND THE BISCUIT CRUMBS SEEM TO ME RATHER GRATUITOUS DECEPTIONS AND WAIT SAID QUARLES YOU ASSUME A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE DECEIVED NINE MEN OUT OF TEN YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE TENTH MAN
7190-90543-0023 AMATEUR OR NOT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A VERY SMART MAN SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ENEMY WIGAN ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE WORK OF AN AMATEUR TO WHAT DEFINITE POINT DOES IT LEAD YOU TO THIS QUESTION I REPLIED DID SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD BURGLE HIS OWN HOUSE
7190-90543-0024 WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO HIS MANNER WAS CURIOUS THEN THERE IS ONLY HIS OWN STATEMENT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN BUT SUPPOSING HE WISHED TO GET RID OF PAPERS OR
7190-90543-0025 WOULD HE NOT HAVE ROBBED HIMSELF OF SOMETHING TO MAKE THE AFFAIR MORE PLAUSIBLE SAID QUARLES THE AMATEUR CONSTANTLY OVERLOOKS THE OBVIOUS I ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
7190-90543-0026 I THINK THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE MAN'S TEMPERAMENT PROFESSOR
7190-90543-0027 SIR JOSEPH'S STANDING IS VERY HIGH SUDDEN TEMPTATION OR NECESSITY MAY SUBVERT THE HIGHEST CHARACTER I ANSWERED
7190-90543-0028 WHEN I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HIS MANNER SEEMED CURIOUS AS I HAVE SAID HE AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO PART IN ANY GOVERNMENT SECRET OR MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY GRATUITOUS INFORMATION YOU UNDERSTAND
7190-90543-0029 NOT IN ANSWER TO ANY DIRECT QUESTION OF MINE SHOWING THAT THE IDEAS WERE IN HIS MIND WHY THE EXPLANATION WOULD BE SIMPLE IF HE WERE THE BURGLAR OF HIS OWN PAPERS
7190-90543-0030 I ADMIT THE ARGUMENT IS SOUND WIGAN BUT IT DOES NOT CREEP INTO MY BRAIN WITH ANY COMPELLING INFLUENCE THERE IS A LINK MISSING IN THE CHAIN SOMEWHERE AND HE LOOKED AT ZENA HIS OFTEN REPEATED STATEMENT THAT SHE HELPED HIM BY HER QUESTIONS HAD NEVER IMPRESSED ME VERY GREATLY
7190-90543-0031 WHEN A MYSTERY WAS CLEARED UP IT WAS EASY TO SAY THAT ZENA HAD PUT HIM ON THE RIGHT ROAD AND I CONSIDERED IT A WHIM OF HIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
7190-90543-0032 IT WAS SO NOW YOU DO NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN THE BROKEN BOX OF COUNTERS SHE SAID TURNING TOWARD HER GRANDFATHER I WONDER WIGAN IS THAT THE CLEW QUARLES SAID QUICKLY IT CREEPS INTO MY BRAIN THE COUNTERS WERE IN A HEAP I SAID
7190-90543-0033 ASKED QUARLES NO THAT WOULD HAVE SCATTERED THEM MORE THEY WERE ROUND AND MIGHT HAVE FALLEN OVER AFTER HAVING BEEN PUT ONE UPON ANOTHER AS ONE GATHERS COPPERS TOGETHER WHEN COUNTING A NUMBER OF THEM SIR JOSEPH PICKED THEM UP
7190-90543-0034 DID THAT STRIKE YOU AS SIGNIFICANT ASKED QUARLES I CANNOT SAY IT DID
7190-90543-0035 THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT WIGAN BUT I CANNOT SEE YET IN WHICH DIRECTION THEY LEAD US WE MUST WAIT FOR THE MOMENT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE I HAD BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED TO QUARLES JUMPING TO SOME SUDDEN CONCLUSION THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED
7190-90543-0036 NATURALLY I WAS NOT IDLE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT AT THE END OF THEM I HAD LEARNT NOTHING THEN THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENED ON CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS TWO DOCTORS HOUSES WERE BURGLED THE FIRST WAS IN KENSINGTON
7190-90543-0037 RATHER THAN INTENDED ROBBERY NOTHING HAD BEEN STOLEN BUT EVERYTHING IN HIS ROOM WAS IN DISORDER AND A SMALL AND UNIQUE INLAID CABINET WITH A SECRET SPRING LOCK HAD BEEN SMASHED TO PIECES SEVERAL CIGARETTE ENDS WERE ON THE FLOOR
7190-90543-0038 HE HAD SEVERAL CABINETS IN HIS ROOM CONTAINING SPECIMENS AND EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED ON TO THE FLOOR AND DAMAGED MORE OR LESS IN FACT ALTHOUGH NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN THE DAMAGE WAS CONSIDERABLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE BURGLARY DOCTOR WOOD WAS AWAY FROM HOME
7190-90543-0039 ONLY SERVANTS BEING IN THE HOUSE THE COOK SUFFERING FROM FACEACHE HAD BEEN RESTLESS ALL NIGHT BUT HAD HEARD NOTHING
7190-90543-0040 FOR A REVOLVER LOADED IN EVERY CHAMBER WAS FOUND ON ONE OF THE CABINETS APPARENTLY HAVING PUT IT READY FOR USE HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT AWAY THE DOCTOR WAS FURIOUS AT THE WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS SPECIMENS
7190-90543-0041 THE UNEXPECTED HAS HAPPENED I SAID NO NO THE EXPECTED
7190-90543-0042 I'VE READ EVERY REPORT BUT TELL ME YOURSELF EVERY DETAIL I DID SO THE SAME BRAND OF CIGARETTES HE ASKED NO BUT ALL CHEAP AMERICAN ONES
7190-90543-0043 YOU STILL THINK THAT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED
7190-90543-0044 NO I HOLD TO THE ONE MAN THEORY AND YOU ARE RIGHT HE SNAPPED I ADMIT I MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT UPON THE RIGHT TRACK HAD YOU NOT MADE THAT DISCOVERY IT WAS CLEVER WIGAN IT DID NOT SEEM TO HELP YOU TO A THEORY I ANSWERED TRUE
7190-90543-0045 MUCH DEPENDED UPON THE ANSWER IF HE HAD
7190-90543-0046 IF THE THIEF HAD NOT FOUND WHAT HE WANTED HE WOULD CONTINUE HIS SEARCH I ARGUED FOR SOME REASON HE CONNECTED SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD WITH THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH
163-122947-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
163-122947-0001 OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
163-122947-0002 AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
163-122947-0003 WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
163-122947-0004 AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
163-122947-0005 IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
163-122947-0006 NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
163-122947-0007 SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
163-122947-0008 AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
163-122947-0009 INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
163-122947-0010 IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
163-122947-0011 AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
163-122947-0012 MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
163-122947-0013 LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
163-122947-0014 FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
163-122947-0015 JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0016 I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
163-122947-0017 SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
163-122947-0018 TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
163-122947-0019 IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
163-122947-0020 MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
163-122947-0021 I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
163-122947-0022 IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
163-122947-0023 GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
163-122947-0024 AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
163-122947-0025 THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
163-122947-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
163-122947-0027 WHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATING
163-122947-0028 EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
163-122947-0029 THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
163-122947-0030 THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
163-122947-0031 AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
163-122947-0032 SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0033 BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
163-122947-0034 MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
163-122947-0035 THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
163-122947-0036 DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
163-122947-0037 FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
163-122947-0038 AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
163-122947-0039 THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
163-122947-0040 THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
163-122947-0041 TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
163-122947-0042 AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
163-122947-0043 OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
163-122947-0044 HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
163-122947-0045 WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
163-122947-0046 AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
163-122947-0047 PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
163-122947-0048 THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
163-122947-0049 THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
163-122947-0050 HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
163-122947-0051 AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
163-122947-0052 BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
163-122947-0053 AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
163-122947-0054 THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0055 WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
163-122947-0056 ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
163-122947-0057 A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
163-122947-0058 OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
163-122947-0059 THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
163-122947-0060 WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
163-122947-0061 IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
163-122947-0062 LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
163-122947-0063 IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
163-122947-0064 THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0065 AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
163-122947-0066 AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
163-122947-0067 OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
163-122947-0068 WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
163-122947-0069 THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
163-122947-0070 FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
163-122947-0071 WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
163-122947-0072 AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
163-122947-0073 THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
163-122947-0074 CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
163-122947-0075 THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
163-122947-0076 APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
163-122947-0077 SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
163-122947-0078 AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
163-122947-0079 IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
163-122947-0080 AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
163-122947-0081 PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
163-122947-0082 THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
163-122947-0083 HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
163-122947-0084 AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
163-122947-0085 LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
163-122947-0086 THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
163-122947-0087 OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
163-122947-0088 HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
163-122947-0089 IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
163-122947-0090 BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
163-122947-0091 INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
163-122947-0092 JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
163-122947-0093 NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
163-122947-0094 HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
163-122947-0095 IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
163-122947-0096 IS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITY
163-122947-0097 OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
163-122947-0098 I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
1098-133695-0000 AS IF THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN IN A POSITION TO APPEAL TO IT BUT IN FACT THE BRITISH PUBLIC REMAINED FOR THE PRESENT PROFOUNDLY INDIFFERENT TO MISS ISABEL ARCHER WHOSE FORTUNE HAD DROPPED HER AS HER COUSIN SAID INTO THE DULLEST HOUSE IN ENGLAND
1098-133695-0001 HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
1098-133695-0002 FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHE HAD VERY LITTLE RELISH BUT NOTHING PLEASED HER MORE THAN TO FIND HER HALL TABLE WHITENED WITH OBLONG MORSELS OF SYMBOLIC PASTEBOARD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS A VERY JUST WOMAN
1098-133695-0003 AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
1098-133695-0004 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
1098-133695-0005 ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
1098-133695-0006 ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
1098-133695-0007 SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
1098-133695-0008 SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
1098-133695-0009 THERE ARE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW IN THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SENSE TO TAKE THEM YOU MAY SAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM VERY NUMEROUS AMERICAN NEVER IN THE WORLD THAT'S SHOCKINGLY NARROW MY POINT OF VIEW THANK GOD IS PERSONAL
1098-133695-0010 ISABEL THOUGHT THIS A BETTER ANSWER THAN SHE ADMITTED IT WAS A TOLERABLE DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN MANNER OF JUDGING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WELL FOR HER TO SAY SO
1098-133695-0011 WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
1098-133695-0012 WITH WHOM SHE TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND WITH WHOM HER CONVERSATION WAS OF A SORT THAT GAVE A LARGE LICENCE TO EXTRAVAGANCE HER COUSIN USED AS THE PHRASE IS TO CHAFF HER
1098-133695-0013 HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
1098-133695-0014 OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
1098-133695-0015 HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
1098-133695-0016 HIS ADOPTED AND HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HIS CHARMING NEW FOUND COUSIN I KEEP A BAND OF MUSIC IN MY ANTE ROOM HE SAID ONCE TO HER IT HAS ORDERS TO PLAY WITHOUT STOPPING IT RENDERS ME TWO EXCELLENT SERVICES
1098-133695-0017 IT KEEPS THE SOUNDS OF THE WORLD FROM REACHING THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND IT MAKES THE WORLD THINK THAT DANCING'S GOING ON WITHIN
1098-133695-0018 THE LIVELIEST WALTZES SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON THE AIR ISABEL OFTEN FOUND HERSELF IRRITATED BY THIS PERPETUAL FIDDLING
1098-133695-0019 AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
1098-133695-0020 IT MUST BE SAID THAT HER WIT WAS EXERCISED TO A LARGE EXTENT IN SELF DEFENCE FOR HER COUSIN AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CALLING HER COLUMBIA AND ACCUSING HER OF A PATRIOTISM SO HEATED THAT IT SCORCHED HE DREW A CARICATURE OF HER
1098-133695-0021 IN THE FOLDS OF THE NATIONAL BANNER ISABEL'S CHIEF DREAD IN LIFE AT THIS PERIOD OF HER DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT SHE SHOULD APPEAR NARROW MINDED WHAT SHE FEARED NEXT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT SHE SHOULD REALLY BE SO BUT SHE NEVERTHELESS
1098-133695-0022 SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
1098-133695-0023 SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO DIFFER FROM HIM ON A VARIETY OF POINTS IN FACT THE QUALITY OF THIS SMALL RIPE COUNTRY SEEMED AS SWEET TO HER AS THE TASTE OF AN OCTOBER PEAR
1098-133695-0024 AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
1098-133695-0025 IF HER GOOD HUMOUR FLAGGED AT MOMENTS IT WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HERSELF ILL USED BUT BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY FELT SORRY FOR RALPH IT SEEMED TO HER HE WAS TALKING AS A BLIND AND HAD LITTLE HEART IN WHAT HE SAID
1098-133695-0026 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
1098-133695-0027 I DON'T THINK YOU CARE FOR ANYTHING YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR ENGLAND WHEN YOU PRAISE IT YOU DON'T CARE FOR AMERICA EVEN WHEN YOU PRETEND TO ABUSE IT I CARE FOR NOTHING BUT YOU DEAR COUSIN SAID RALPH IF I COULD BELIEVE
1098-133695-0028 EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1098-133695-0029 AT A TIME WHEN HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A BURDEN TO HIM HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WHICH PROMISED NOTHING AND WAS AN OPEN HANDED GIFT OF FATE HAD REFRESHED AND QUICKENED THEM GIVEN THEM WINGS AND SOMETHING TO FLY FOR
1098-133695-0030 POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
1098-133695-0031 THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
1098-133695-0032 WHO WAS WAITING TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS GUARD IF THE MANOEUVRE SHOULD SUCCEED THERE WOULD BE LITTLE HOPE OF ANY GREAT RESISTANCE RALPH HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HIS FATHER WOULD SURVIVE HIM THAT HIS OWN NAME WOULD BE THE FIRST GRIMLY CALLED
1098-133695-0033 THE FATHER AND SON HAD BEEN CLOSE COMPANIONS AND THE IDEA OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH THE REMNANT OF A TASTELESS LIFE ON HIS HANDS WAS NOT GRATIFYING TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS AND TACITLY COUNTED UPON HIS ELDER'S HELP IN MAKING THE BEST OF A POOR BUSINESS
1098-133695-0034 AT THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HIS GREAT MOTIVE RALPH LOST INDEED HIS ONE INSPIRATION
1098-133695-0035 BUT WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S SOCIETY HE SHOULD BARELY HAVE PATIENCE TO AWAIT HIS OWN TURN HE HAD NOT THE INCENTIVE OF FEELING THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIS MOTHER IT WAS A RULE WITH HIS MOTHER TO HAVE NO REGRETS
1098-133695-0036 HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT IT HAD BEEN A SMALL KINDNESS TO HIS FATHER TO WISH THAT OF THE TWO THE ACTIVE RATHER THAN THE PASSIVE PARTY SHOULD KNOW THE FELT WOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS TREATED HIS OWN FORECAST OF AN EARLY END AS A CLEVER FALLACY
1098-133695-0037 WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
1098-133695-0038 HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE HARBOURING LOVE FOR THIS SPONTANEOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY BUT HE JUDGED THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT AFTER HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR A WEEK HE QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS AND EVERY DAY HE FELT A LITTLE MORE SURE
1098-133695-0039 LORD WARBURTON HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT HER SHE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING LITTLE FIGURE RALPH WONDERED HOW THEIR NEIGHBOUR HAD FOUND IT OUT SO SOON AND THEN HE SAID IT WAS ONLY ANOTHER PROOF OF HIS FRIEND'S HIGH ABILITIES
1098-133695-0040 WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS GREATLY ADMIRED IF HIS COUSIN WERE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ENTERTAINMENT TO HIM RALPH WAS CONSCIOUS SHE WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT OF A HIGH ORDER A CHARACTER LIKE THAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1098-133695-0041 A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
1098-133695-0042 THAN A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL IT'S VERY PLEASANT TO BE SO WELL TREATED WHERE ONE HAD LEAST LOOKED FOR IT I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BLUE MORE BORED THAN FOR A WEEK BEFORE SHE CAME I HAD NEVER EXPECTED LESS THAT ANYTHING PLEASANT WOULD HAPPEN
1098-133695-0043 A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
1098-133695-0044 AND NOW YOU HAD BETTER KEEP VERY QUIET AND NEVER GRUMBLE AGAIN THE SENTIMENT OF THESE REFLEXIONS WAS VERY JUST
1098-133695-0045 HIS COUSIN WAS A VERY BRILLIANT GIRL
1098-133695-0046 BUT SHE NEEDED THE KNOWING AND HIS ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HER THOUGH IT WAS CONTEMPLATIVE AND CRITICAL WAS NOT JUDICIAL HE SURVEYED THE EDIFICE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND ADMIRED IT GREATLY
1098-133695-0047 ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY WAS THAT SHE GAVE ONE AN IMPRESSION OF HAVING INTENTIONS OF HER OWN WHENEVER SHE EXECUTES THEM SAID RALPH MAY I BE THERE TO SEE IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM OF COURSE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE PLACE
1098-133695-0048 AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
1098-133695-0049 A PASTIME FOR WHICH THE WEATHER REMAINED FAVOURABLE WITH A PERSISTENCY NOT ALLOWED FOR IN ISABEL'S SOMEWHAT LUGUBRIOUS PREVISION OF THE CLIMATE AND IN THE LONG AFTERNOONS OF WHICH THE LENGTH WAS BUT THE MEASURE OF HER GRATIFIED EAGERNESS
1098-133695-0050 THEY TOOK A BOAT ON THE RIVER THE DEAR LITTLE RIVER AS ISABEL CALLED IT WHERE THE OPPOSITE SHORE SEEMED STILL A PART OF THE FOREGROUND OF THE LANDSCAPE OR DROVE OVER THE COUNTRY IN A PHAETON A LOW CAPACIOUS THICK WHEELED PHAETON
1098-133695-0051 BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
1098-133695-0052 FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
1098-133695-0053 BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
1098-133695-0054 BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
1098-133695-0055 ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
1098-133695-0056 OF WHICH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE DESULTORY CHARACTER WAS APPRECIABLE WITH
1098-133695-0057 HE HAD DRIVEN OVER FROM HIS OWN PLACE WITH A PORTMANTEAU AND HAD ASKED AS THE FATHER AND SON OFTEN INVITED HIM TO DO FOR A DINNER AND A LODGING ISABEL SEEING HIM FOR HALF AN HOUR ON THE DAY OF HER ARRIVAL HAD DISCOVERED IN THIS BRIEF SPACE THAT SHE LIKED HIM
1098-133695-0058 HE HAD INDEED RATHER SHARPLY REGISTERED HIMSELF ON HER FINE SENSE AND SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD HOPED SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN HOPED TOO THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A FEW OTHERS GARDENCOURT WAS NOT DULL
1098-133695-0059 THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
1098-133695-0060 HER IMPRESSIONS WERE STILL SO FRESH AND SO QUICKLY RENEWED THAT THERE WAS AS YET HARDLY A HINT OF VACANCY IN THE VIEW BUT ISABEL HAD NEED TO REMIND HERSELF THAT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN HUMAN NATURE AND THAT HER FOREMOST HOPE IN COMING ABROAD
1098-133695-0061 HAD BEEN THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHEN RALPH SAID TO HER AS HE HAD DONE SEVERAL TIMES I WONDER YOU FIND THIS ENDURABLE YOU OUGHT TO SEE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND SOME OF OUR FRIENDS
1098-133695-0062 THOUGH YOU WOULD NEVER SUPPOSE IT WHEN HE OFFERED TO INVITE WHAT HE CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAKE HER ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLISH SOCIETY SHE ENCOURAGED THE HOSPITABLE IMPULSE AND PROMISED IN ADVANCE TO HURL HERSELF INTO THE FRAY
1098-133695-0063 LITTLE HOWEVER FOR THE PRESENT HAD COME OF HIS OFFERS AND IT MAY BE CONFIDED TO THE READER THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN DELAYED TO CARRY THEM OUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE LABOUR OF PROVIDING FOR HIS COMPANION BY NO MEANS SO SEVERE AS TO REQUIRE EXTRANEOUS HELP
1098-133695-0064 ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECIMENS IT WAS A WORD THAT PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE PART IN HER VOCABULARY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WISHED TO SEE ENGLISH SOCIETY ILLUSTRATED BY EMINENT CASES
1098-133695-0065 WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0066 OH NO THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0067 SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
1098-133695-0068 THE FORTUNATE LORD WARBURTON EXCHANGED A HANDSHAKE WITH OUR HEROINE AND HOPED SHE WAS VERY WELL BUT I NEEDN'T ASK THAT HE SAID SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE OARS I'VE BEEN ROWING A LITTLE ISABEL ANSWERED BUT HOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IT
1098-133695-0069 OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
1098-133695-0070 CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
1098-133695-0071 IT MAKES ONE WANT TO BE TOUCHED MISS ARCHER LORD WARBURTON DECLARED
1098-133695-0072 WHO IF IT PLEASED HER TO HEAR IT SAID THAT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE NUMEROUS WAS HAPPILY ABLE TO REFLECT THAT SUCH COMPLACENCY WAS NOT THE INDICATION OF A FEEBLE MIND INASMUCH AS THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS IN WHICH SHE EXCELLED
1098-133695-0073 HAD AT LEAST THE ELEMENT OF HUMILITY THAT IT ALWAYS NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED BY PROOF LORD WARBURTON NOT ONLY SPENT THE NIGHT AT GARDENCOURT BUT HE WAS PERSUADED TO REMAIN OVER THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN THE SECOND DAY WAS ENDED
1098-133695-0074 HE DETERMINED TO POSTPONE HIS DEPARTURE TILL THE MORROW DURING THIS PERIOD HE ADDRESSED MANY OF HIS REMARKS TO ISABEL WHO ACCEPTED THIS EVIDENCE OF HIS ESTEEM WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE SHE FOUND HERSELF LIKING HIM EXTREMELY
1098-133695-0075 THE FIRST IMPRESSION HE HAD MADE ON HER HAD HAD WEIGHT BUT AT THE END OF AN EVENING SPENT IN HIS SOCIETY SHE SCARCE FELL SHORT OF SEEING HIM THOUGH QUITE WITHOUT LURIDITY AS A HERO OF ROMANCE
1098-133695-0076 WITH A QUICKENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF POSSIBLE FELICITIES IT'S VERY NICE TO KNOW TWO SUCH CHARMING PEOPLE AS THOSE SHE SAID MEANING BY THOSE HER COUSIN AND HER COUSIN'S FRIEND IT MUST BE ADDED MOREOVER
1098-133695-0077 THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED WHICH MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO PUT HER GOOD HUMOUR TO THE TEST
1098-133695-0078 BUT HIS WIFE REMAINED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY SHE PROLONGED HER VIGIL FOR SOMETHING LESS THAN AN HOUR AND THEN RISING OBSERVED TO ISABEL THAT IT WAS TIME THEY SHOULD BID THE GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT ISABEL HAD AS YET NO DESIRE TO GO TO BED
1098-133695-0079 THE OCCASION WORE TO HER SENSE A FESTIVE CHARACTER AND FEASTS WERE NOT IN THE HABIT OF TERMINATING SO EARLY SO WITHOUT FURTHER THOUGHT SHE REPLIED VERY SIMPLY NEED I GO DEAR AUNT I'LL COME UP IN HALF AN HOUR
1098-133695-0080 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD WAIT FOR YOU MISSUS TOUCHETT ANSWERED
1098-133695-0081 RALPH WILL LIGHT MY CANDLE ISABEL GAILY ENGAGED I'LL LIGHT YOUR CANDLE DO LET ME LIGHT YOUR CANDLE MISS ARCHER
1098-133695-0082 ONLY I BEG IT SHALL NOT BE BEFORE MIDNIGHT
1098-133695-0083 AND TRANSFERRED THEM COLDLY TO HER NIECE
1098-133695-0084 YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT AT YOUR BLEST ALBANY MY DEAR ISABEL ROSE BLUSHING I WISH I WERE SHE SAID OH I SAY MOTHER RALPH BROKE OUT
1098-133695-0085 I MUST TAKE IT AS I FIND IT CAN'T I STAY WITH MY OWN COUSIN ISABEL ENQUIRED I'M NOT AWARE THAT LORD WARBURTON IS YOUR COUSIN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER GO TO BED THE VISITOR SUGGESTED THAT WILL ARRANGE IT
1098-133695-0086 MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
1098-133695-0087 RALPH MEANWHILE HANDED ISABEL HER CANDLESTICK HE HAD BEEN WATCHING HER IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM HER TEMPER WAS INVOLVED AN ACCIDENT THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING BUT IF HE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING OF A FLARE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR THE GIRL SIMPLY LAUGHED A LITTLE
1098-133695-0088 NODDED GOOD NIGHT AND WITHDREW ACCOMPANIED BY HER AUNT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS MOTHER THOUGH HE THOUGHT SHE WAS RIGHT ABOVE STAIRS THE TWO LADIES SEPARATED AT MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR ISABEL HAD SAID NOTHING ON HER WAY UP
1098-133695-0089 ISABEL CONSIDERED I'M NOT VEXED BUT I'M SURPRISED AND A GOOD DEAL MYSTIFIED WASN'T IT PROPER I SHOULD REMAIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOT IN THE LEAST YOUNG GIRLS HERE IN DECENT HOUSES
1098-133695-0090 DON'T SIT ALONE WITH THE GENTLEMEN LATE AT NIGHT YOU WERE VERY RIGHT TO TELL ME THEN SAID ISABEL I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT I'M VERY GLAD TO KNOW IT I SHALL ALWAYS TELL YOU HER AUNT ANSWERED WHENEVER I SEE YOU TAKING WHAT SEEMS TO ME TOO MUCH LIBERTY
1098-133695-0091 YES I THINK I'M VERY FOND OF THEM BUT I ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW THE THINGS ONE SHOULDN'T DO SO AS TO DO THEM ASKED HER AUNT
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0001 DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0004 WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0010 AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0019 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0022 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0031 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0034 IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0002 THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0008 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0011 TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0014 SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0023 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0026 HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0029 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0032 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
60-121082-0000 THE EVENING PASSED ON MADAME DE VILLEFORT EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO RETURN TO PARIS WHICH MADAME DANGLARS HAD NOT DARED TO DO NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNEASINESS SHE EXPERIENCED ON HIS WIFE'S REQUEST M DE VILLEFORT
60-121082-0001 WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THE SIGNAL OF DEPARTURE HE OFFERED A SEAT IN HIS LANDAU TO MADAME DANGLARS THAT SHE MIGHT BE UNDER THE CARE OF HIS WIFE
60-121082-0002 AS FOR M DANGLARS ABSORBED IN AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITH M CAVALCANTI HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT WAS PASSING
60-121082-0003 HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
60-121082-0004 WITHOUT OPPOSING THEIR ARRANGEMENTS HE ALLOWED MORREL CHATEAU RENAUD AND DEBRAY TO LEAVE ON HORSEBACK AND THE LADIES IN M DE VILLEFORT'S CARRIAGE DANGLARS MORE AND MORE DELIGHTED WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI
60-121082-0005 HAD OFFERED HIM A SEAT IN HIS CARRIAGE ANDREA CAVALCANTI FOUND HIS TILBURY WAITING AT THE DOOR THE GROOM IN EVERY RESPECT A CARICATURE OF THE ENGLISH FASHION
60-121082-0006 WAS STANDING ON TIPTOE TO HOLD A LARGE IRON GRAY HORSE ANDREA HAD SPOKEN VERY LITTLE DURING DINNER HE WAS AN INTELLIGENT LAD AND HE FEARED TO UTTER SOME ABSURDITY BEFORE SO MANY GRAND PEOPLE
60-121082-0007 AMONGST WHOM WITH DILATING EYES HE SAW THE KING'S ATTORNEY THEN HE HAD BEEN SEIZED UPON BY DANGLARS WHO WITH A RAPID GLANCE AT THE STIFF NECKED OLD MAJOR AND HIS MODEST SON
60-121082-0008 AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HOSPITALITY OF THE COUNT MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE WAS IN THE SOCIETY OF SOME NABOB COME TO PARIS TO FINISH THE WORLDLY EDUCATION OF HIS HEIR
60-121082-0009 HE CONTEMPLATED WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT THE LARGE DIAMOND WHICH SHONE ON THE MAJOR'S LITTLE FINGER FOR THE MAJOR LIKE A PRUDENT MAN IN CASE OF ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENING TO HIS BANK NOTES HAD IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THEM INTO AN AVAILABLE ASSET
60-121082-0010 THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
60-121082-0011 WERE SO FULL OF AFFABILITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HANDS EVEN WITH THE BANKER'S SERVANTS SO MUCH DID THEIR GRATITUDE NEED AN OBJECT TO EXPEND ITSELF UPON ONE THING ABOVE ALL THE REST HEIGHTENED THE RESPECT
60-121082-0012 NAY ALMOST THE VENERATION OF DANGLARS FOR CAVALCANTI THE LATTER FAITHFUL TO THE PRINCIPLE OF HORACE NIL ADMIRARI HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE
60-121082-0013 BY DECLARING IN WHAT LAKE THE BEST LAMPREYS WERE CAUGHT THEN HE HAD EATEN SOME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD MORE
60-121082-0014 DANGLARS THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT SUCH LUXURIES WERE COMMON AT THE TABLE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS DESCENDANT OF THE CAVALCANTI WHO MOST LIKELY IN LUCCA FED UPON TROUT BROUGHT FROM SWITZERLAND AND LOBSTERS SENT FROM ENGLAND
60-121082-0015 BY THE SAME MEANS USED BY THE COUNT TO BRING THE LAMPREYS FROM LAKE FUSARO AND THE STERLET FROM THE VOLGA THUS IT WAS WITH MUCH POLITENESS OF MANNER THAT HE HEARD CAVALCANTI PRONOUNCE THESE WORDS
60-121082-0016 TO MORROW SIR I SHALL HAVE THE HONOR OF WAITING UPON YOU ON BUSINESS AND I SIR SAID DANGLARS SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO RECEIVE YOU
60-121082-0017 IF IT WOULD NOT BE DEPRIVING HIM OF THE COMPANY OF HIS SON TO THIS CAVALCANTI REPLIED BY SAYING THAT FOR SOME TIME PAST HIS SON HAD LIVED INDEPENDENTLY OF HIM THAT HE HAD HIS OWN HORSES AND CARRIAGES
60-121082-0018 AND THAT NOT HAVING COME TOGETHER IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LEAVE SEPARATELY THE MAJOR SEATED HIMSELF THEREFORE BY THE SIDE OF DANGLARS
60-121082-0019 WHO WAS MORE AND MORE CHARMED WITH THE IDEAS OF ORDER AND ECONOMY WHICH RULED THIS MAN AND YET WHO BEING ABLE TO ALLOW HIS SON SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
60-121082-0020 AS FOR ANDREA HE BEGAN BY WAY OF SHOWING OFF TO SCOLD HIS GROOM WHO INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE TILBURY TO THE STEPS OF THE HOUSE HAD TAKEN IT TO THE OUTER DOOR THUS
60-121082-0021 GIVING HIM THE TROUBLE OF WALKING THIRTY STEPS TO REACH IT THE GROOM HEARD HIM WITH HUMILITY TOOK THE BIT OF THE IMPATIENT ANIMAL WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND WITH THE RIGHT HELD OUT THE REINS TO ANDREA
60-121082-0022 WHO TAKING THEM FROM HIM RESTED HIS POLISHED BOOT LIGHTLY ON THE STEP AT THAT MOMENT A HAND TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER THE YOUNG MAN TURNED ROUND
60-121082-0023 AND HAD RETURNED JUST AS THEY WERE STARTING BUT INSTEAD OF EITHER OF THESE HE SAW NOTHING BUT A STRANGE FACE SUNBURNT AND ENCIRCLED BY A BEARD WITH EYES BRILLIANT AS CARBUNCLES
60-121082-0024 AND A SMILE UPON THE MOUTH WHICH DISPLAYED A PERFECT SET OF WHITE TEETH POINTED AND SHARP AS THE WOLF'S OR JACKAL'S A RED HANDKERCHIEF ENCIRCLED HIS GRAY HEAD
60-121082-0025 TORN AND FILTHY GARMENTS COVERED HIS LARGE BONY LIMBS WHICH SEEMED AS THOUGH LIKE THOSE OF A SKELETON THEY WOULD RATTLE AS HE WALKED AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE LEANED UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDER
60-121082-0026 AND WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING ANDREA SAW SEEMED OF GIGANTIC SIZE DID THE YOUNG MAN RECOGNIZE THAT FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN IN HIS TILBURY
60-121082-0027 OR WAS HE MERELY STRUCK WITH THE HORRIBLE APPEARANCE OF HIS INTERROGATOR WE CANNOT SAY BUT ONLY RELATE THE FACT THAT HE SHUDDERED AND STEPPED BACK SUDDENLY
60-121082-0028 HE ASKED PARDON ME MY FRIEND IF I DISTURB YOU SAID THE MAN WITH THE RED HANDKERCHIEF BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BEG AT NIGHT
60-121082-0029 SAID THE GROOM ENDEAVORING TO RID HIS MASTER OF THE TROUBLESOME INTRUDER I AM NOT BEGGING MY FINE FELLOW SAID THE UNKNOWN TO THE SERVANT WITH SO IRONICAL AN EXPRESSION OF THE EYE AND SO FRIGHTFUL A SMILE THAT HE WITHDREW
60-121082-0030 I ONLY WISH TO SAY TWO OR THREE WORDS TO YOUR MASTER WHO GAVE ME A COMMISSION TO EXECUTE ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO COME SAID ANDREA WITH SUFFICIENT NERVE FOR HIS SERVANT NOT TO PERCEIVE HIS AGITATION WHAT DO YOU WANT
60-121082-0031 SPEAK QUICKLY FRIEND THE MAN SAID IN A LOW VOICE I WISH I WISH YOU TO SPARE ME THE WALK BACK TO PARIS I AM VERY TIRED AND AS I HAVE NOT EATEN SO GOOD A DINNER AS YOU
60-121082-0032 I CAN SCARCELY STAND THE YOUNG MAN SHUDDERED AT THIS STRANGE FAMILIARITY TELL ME HE SAID TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT WELL THEN
60-121082-0033 I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME UP IN YOUR FINE CARRIAGE AND CARRY ME BACK ANDREA TURNED PALE BUT SAID NOTHING
60-121082-0034 YES SAID THE MAN THRUSTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND LOOKING IMPUDENTLY AT THE YOUTH I HAVE TAKEN THE WHIM INTO MY HEAD DO YOU UNDERSTAND MASTER BENEDETTO
60-121082-0035 AT THIS NAME NO DOUBT THE YOUNG MAN REFLECTED A LITTLE FOR HE WENT TOWARDS HIS GROOM SAYING THIS MAN IS RIGHT I DID INDEED CHARGE HIM WITH A COMMISSION THE RESULT OF WHICH HE MUST TELL ME WALK TO THE BARRIER
60-121082-0036 THERE TAKE A CAB THAT YOU MAY NOT BE TOO LATE THE SURPRISED GROOM RETIRED LET ME AT LEAST REACH A SHADY SPOT SAID ANDREA OH AS FOR THAT
60-121082-0037 I'LL TAKE YOU TO A SPLENDID PLACE SAID THE MAN WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF AND TAKING THE HORSE'S BIT HE LED THE TILBURY WHERE IT WAS CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO WITNESS THE HONOR THAT ANDREA CONFERRED UPON HIM
60-121082-0038 DON'T THINK I WANT THE GLORY OF RIDING IN YOUR FINE CARRIAGE SAID HE OH NO IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I AM TIRED AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE BUSINESS TO TALK OVER WITH YOU
60-121082-0039 COME STEP IN SAID THE YOUNG MAN IT WAS A PITY THIS SCENE HAD NOT OCCURRED IN DAYLIGHT FOR IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE THIS RASCAL THROWING HIMSELF HEAVILY DOWN ON THE CUSHION BESIDE THE YOUNG AND ELEGANT DRIVER OF THE TILBURY
60-121082-0040 ANDREA DROVE PAST THE LAST HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HIS COMPANION WHO SMILED COMPLACENTLY AS THOUGH WELL PLEASED TO FIND HIMSELF TRAVELLING IN SO COMFORTABLE A VEHICLE
60-121082-0041 ANDREA LOOKED AROUND IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NEITHER BE SEEN NOR HEARD AND THEN STOPPING THE HORSE AND CROSSING HIS ARMS BEFORE THE MAN HE ASKED NOW
60-121082-0042 LET ME ASK YOU WHY YOU DECEIVED ME HOW HAVE I DECEIVED YOU HOW DO YOU ASK
60-121082-0043 BUT INSTEAD OF THAT YOU COME TO PARIS HOW DOES THAT ANNOY YOU IT DOES NOT ON THE CONTRARY I THINK IT WILL ANSWER MY PURPOSE SO SAID ANDREA

60-121082-0063 OH BE EASY I HAVE NO DESIGN UPON YOUR COUNT AND YOU SHALL HAVE HIM ALL TO YOURSELF BUT
60-121082-0064 YOU MUST PAY FOR IT YOU UNDERSTAND WELL
60-121082-0065 I THINK THAT WITH A HUNDRED FRANCS A MONTH WELL I COULD LIVE UPON A HUNDRED FRANCS COME YOU UNDERSTAND ME
60-121082-0066 BUT THAT WITH WITH WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRANCS I SHOULD BE QUITE HAPPY HERE ARE TWO HUNDRED SAID ANDREA
60-121082-0067 THERE NOW AGAIN YOU DEGRADE ME HOW SO BY MAKING ME APPLY TO THE SERVANTS WHEN I WANT TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH YOU ALONE WELL BE IT SO THEN
60-121082-0068 TAKE IT FROM ME THEN AND SO LONG AT LEAST AS I RECEIVE MY INCOME YOU SHALL BE PAID YOURS COME COME I ALWAYS SAID YOU WERE A FINE FELLOW AND IT IS A BLESSING WHEN GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENS TO SUCH AS YOU
60-121082-0069 BUT TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT WHY DO YOU WISH TO KNOW ASKED CAVALCANTI WHAT DO YOU AGAIN DEFY ME NO THE FACT IS I HAVE FOUND MY FATHER WHAT
60-121082-0070 A REAL FATHER YES SO LONG AS HE PAYS ME YOU'LL HONOR AND BELIEVE HIM THAT'S RIGHT WHAT IS HIS NAME MAJOR CAVALCANTI
60-121082-0071 SO FAR I HAVE APPEARED TO ANSWER HIS PURPOSE AND WHO FOUND THIS FATHER FOR YOU THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO
60-121082-0072 THE MAN WHOSE HOUSE YOU HAVE JUST LEFT YES

60-121082-0077 DO YOU THINK SO M BOSSUET AND YOU
60-121082-0078 A PEER OF FRANCE AH SAID ANDREA WHO KNOWS MAJOR CAVALCANTI IS ALREADY ONE PERHAPS BUT THEN HEREDITARY RANK IS ABOLISHED
60-121082-0079 AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE ALL YOU WANT AND THAT WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER JUMP DOWN FROM THE TILBURY AND DISAPPEAR
60-121082-0080 HOW NOT AT ALL WHY JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT WITH THIS RED HANDKERCHIEF ON MY HEAD WITH SCARCELY ANY SHOES
60-121082-0081 WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE MAKING IN ALL ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FRANCS WHY I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE ARRESTED AT THE BARRIERS THEN TO JUSTIFY MYSELF I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU GAVE ME THE MONEY
60-121082-0082 THIS WOULD CAUSE INQUIRIES IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT I LEFT TOULON WITHOUT GIVING DUE NOTICE AND I SHOULD THEN BE ESCORTED BACK TO THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN THEN I SHOULD BECOME SIMPLY
60-121082-0083 AND GOOD BY TO MY DREAM OF RESEMBLING THE RETIRED BAKER NO NO MY BOY I PREFER REMAINING HONORABLY IN THE CAPITAL ANDREA SCOWLED CERTAINLY
60-121082-0084 AS HE HAD HIMSELF OWNED THE REPUTED SON OF MAJOR CAVALCANTI WAS A WILFUL FELLOW HE DREW UP FOR A MINUTE THREW A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM AND THEN HIS HAND FELL INSTANTLY INTO HIS POCKET
60-121082-0085 WHERE IT BEGAN PLAYING WITH A PISTOL BUT MEANWHILE
60-121082-0086 WHO HAD NEVER TAKEN HIS EYES OFF HIS COMPANION PASSED HIS HAND BEHIND HIS BACK AND OPENED A LONG SPANISH KNIFE WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM TO BE READY IN CASE OF NEED
60-121082-0087 THE TWO FRIENDS AS WE SEE WERE WORTHY OF AND UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER ANDREA'S HAND LEFT HIS POCKET INOFFENSIVELY AND WAS CARRIED UP TO THE RED MUSTACHE WHICH IT PLAYED WITH FOR SOME TIME
60-121082-0088 HE SAID HOW HAPPY YOU WILL BE I WILL DO MY BEST SAID THE INN KEEPER OF THE PONT DU GARD SHUTTING UP HIS KNIFE WELL THEN WE WILL GO INTO PARIS
60-121082-0089 BUT HOW WILL YOU PASS THROUGH THE BARRIER WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION IT SEEMS TO ME
60-121082-0090 WE SHALL SEE HE THEN TOOK THE GREAT COAT WITH THE LARGE COLLAR WHICH THE GROOM HAD LEFT BEHIND IN THE TILBURY AND PUT IT ON HIS BACK THEN HE TOOK OFF CAVALCANTI'S HAT WHICH HE PLACED UPON HIS OWN HEAD AND FINALLY
60-121082-0091 HE ASSUMED THE CARELESS ATTITUDE OF A SERVANT WHOSE MASTER DRIVES HIMSELF BUT TELL ME SAID ANDREA
60-121082-0092 IT IS SO WINDY THAT YOUR HAT CAN EASILY APPEAR TO HAVE BLOWN OFF COME COME ENOUGH OF THIS SAID CAVALCANTI
60-121082-0093 I HOPE I AM NOT THE CAUSE HUSH SAID ANDREA THEY PASSED THE BARRIER WITHOUT ACCIDENT AT THE FIRST CROSS STREET
60-121082-0094 WELL SAID ANDREA
60-121082-0095 YOU WOULD NOT LIKE ME TO RISK TAKING COLD BUT WHAT AM I TO DO YOU OH YOU ARE YOUNG WHILE I AM BEGINNING TO GET OLD AU REVOIR BENEDETTO
60-121082-0096 AND RUNNING INTO A COURT HE DISAPPEARED ALAS SAID ANDREA SIGHING
2391-145015-0000 STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
2391-145015-0001 AND AS IT CURVES ROUND PRESENTS A GOOD VIEW OF IT ON THE LEFT HAND TO THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELLING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT THREE MILES BEFORE ENTERING THE TUNNEL UNDER POPHAM BEACON IT MAY BE KNOWN TO SOME SPORTSMEN AS LYING IN ONE OF THE BEST PORTIONS OF THE VINE HUNT
2391-145015-0002 IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
2391-145015-0003 AND THOUGH IT IS SUFFICIENTLY WELL CLOTHED WITH WOODS AND HEDGEROWS YET THE POVERTY OF THE SOIL IN MOST PLACES PREVENTS THE TIMBER FROM ATTAINING A LARGE SIZE STILL IT HAS ITS BEAUTIES THE LANES WIND ALONG IN A NATURAL CURVE
2391-145015-0004 CONTINUALLY FRINGED WITH IRREGULAR BORDERS OF NATIVE TURF AND LEAD TO PLEASANT NOOKS AND CORNERS ONE WHO KNEW AND LOVED IT WELL VERY HAPPILY EXPRESSED ITS QUIET CHARMS WHEN HE WROTE TRUE TASTE IS NOT FASTIDIOUS
2391-145015-0005 NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
2391-145015-0006 IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
2391-145015-0007 COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
2391-145015-0008 EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0009 NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
2391-145015-0010 AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS PULLED DOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW HOUSE IN A FAR BETTER SITUATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
2391-145015-0011 ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
2391-145015-0012 ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
2391-145015-0013 BUT THE CHIEF BEAUTY OF STEVENTON CONSISTED IN ITS HEDGEROWS A HEDGEROW IN THAT COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN A THIN FORMAL LINE OF QUICKSET BUT AN IRREGULAR BORDER OF COPSE WOOD AND TIMBER OFTEN WIDE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN WITHIN IT A WINDING FOOTPATH OR A ROUGH CART TRACK
2391-145015-0014 AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
2391-145015-0015 AND WAS FORMED INTO A RUSTIC SHRUBBERY WITH OCCASIONAL SEATS ENTITLED THE WOOD WALK THE OTHER RAN STRAIGHT UP THE HILL UNDER THE NAME OF THE CHURCH WALK BECAUSE IT LED TO THE PARISH CHURCH
2391-145015-0016 WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0017 MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
2391-145015-0018 WHILE ITS SOLITARY POSITION FAR FROM THE HUM OF THE VILLAGE AND WITHIN SIGHT OF NO HABITATION EXCEPT A GLIMPSE OF THE GRAY MANOR HOUSE THROUGH ITS CIRCLING SCREEN OF SYCAMORES HAS IN IT SOMETHING SOLEMN AND APPROPRIATE TO THE LAST RESTING PLACE OF THE SILENT DEAD
2391-145015-0019 SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
2391-145015-0020 THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
2391-145015-0021 THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
2391-145015-0022 THEY SHARED WITH THE PRINCIPAL TENANT THE COMMAND OF AN EXCELLENT MANOR AND ENJOYED IN THIS REFLECTED WAY SOME OF THE CONSIDERATION USUALLY AWARDED TO LANDED PROPRIETORS
2391-145015-0023 THEY HAD ENOUGH TO AFFORD A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TO EXERCISE A LIBERAL HOSPITALITY TO THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND FRIENDS A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES WERE KEPT
2391-145015-0024 THIS MIGHT IMPLY A HIGHER STYLE OF LIVING IN OUR DAYS THAN IT DID IN THEIRS THERE WERE THEN NO ASSESSED TAXES THE CARRIAGE ONCE BOUGHT ENTAILED LITTLE FURTHER EXPENSE AND THE HORSES PROBABLY LIKE MISTER BENNET'S WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED ON FARM WORK
2391-145015-0025 MOREOVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT A PAIR OF HORSES IN THOSE DAYS WERE ALMOST NECESSARY IF LADIES WERE TO MOVE ABOUT AT ALL
2391-145015-0026 WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
2391-145015-0027 THE FAMILY LIVED IN CLOSE INTIMACY WITH TWO COUSINS EDWARD AND JANE COOPER THE CHILDREN OF MISSUS AUSTEN'S ELDEST SISTER AND DOCTOR COOPER THE VICAR OF SONNING NEAR READING THE COOPERS LIVED FOR SOME YEARS AT BATH
2391-145015-0028 I BELIEVE THAT CASSANDRA AND JANE SOMETIMES VISITED THEM THERE AND THAT JANE THUS ACQUIRED THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMS OF BATH WHICH ENABLED HER TO WRITE NORTHANGER ABBEY LONG BEFORE SHE RESIDED THERE HERSELF
2391-145015-0029 AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
2391-145015-0030 AND IN LATER LIFE HE WAS KNOWN BY A WORK ON PROPHECY CALLED THE CRISIS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS PUBLICATIONS ESPECIALLY FOR SEVERAL VOLUMES OF SERMONS MUCH PREACHED IN MANY PULPITS IN MY YOUTH
2391-145015-0031 JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
2391-145015-0032 BUT WAS FATED TO BECOME A CAUSE OF GREAT SORROW TO HER FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE SHE WAS SUDDENLY KILLED BY AN ACCIDENT TO HER CARRIAGE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUSIN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT STEVENTON
2391-145015-0033 WHO MUST HAVE INTRODUCED GREATER VARIETY INTO THE FAMILY CIRCLE THIS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER AUSTEN'S ONLY SISTER MISSUS HANCOCK
2391-145015-0034 OF WHOM I KNOW LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE PERISHED BY THE GUILLOTINE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OFFENCE WAS HIS RANK BUT IT WAS SAID THAT THE CHARGE OF INCIVISM UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED RESTED ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING LAID DOWN SOME ARABLE LAND INTO PASTURE
2391-145015-0035 HIS WIFE ESCAPED THROUGH DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES TO ENGLAND WAS RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME INTO HER UNCLE'S FAMILY AND FINALLY MARRIED HER COUSIN HENRY AUSTEN
2391-145015-0036 SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
2391-145015-0037 BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0038 SHE WAS A CLEVER WOMAN AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE FRENCH RATHER THAN THE ENGLISH MODE AND IN THOSE DAYS WHEN INTERCOURSE WITH THE CONTINENT WAS LONG INTERRUPTED BY WAR SUCH AN ELEMENT IN THE SOCIETY OF A COUNTRY PARSONAGE MUST HAVE BEEN A RARE ACQUISITION
2391-145015-0039 THE SISTERS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INDEBTED TO THIS COUSIN THAN TO MISSUS LA TOURNELLE'S TEACHING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH WHICH THEY POSSESSED SHE ALSO TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PARTS IN THE PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN WHICH THE FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES INDULGED
2391-145015-0040 HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
2391-145015-0041 AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VIGOROUS AND AMUSING JANE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN WHEN THE LAST TOOK PLACE SHE WAS HOWEVER AN EARLY OBSERVER
2391-145015-0042 AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
2391-145015-0043 HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0044 THIS LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY CAUSED GREAT AND LASTING GRIEF TO THE PRINCIPAL SUFFERER AND COULD NOT BUT CAST A GLOOM OVER THE WHOLE PARTY THE SYMPATHY OF JANE WAS PROBABLY FROM HER AGE AND HER PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HER SISTER
2391-145015-0045 HER REVIEWER IN THE QUARTERLY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE OBSERVES CONCERNING THE ATTACHMENT OF FANNY PRICE TO EDMUND BERTRAM THE SILENCE IN WHICH THIS PASSION IS CHERISHED THE SLENDER HOPES AND ENJOYMENTS BY WHICH IT IS FED
2391-145015-0046 THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
2391-145015-0047 AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
2391-145015-0048 IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER LIFE WAS THERE ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER HEROINE IN MANSFIELD PARK
2391-145015-0049 IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
2391-145015-0050 THERE IS HOWEVER ONE PASSAGE OF ROMANCE IN HER HISTORY WITH WHICH I AM IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED AND TO WHICH I AM UNABLE TO ASSIGN NAME OR DATE OR PLACE THOUGH I HAVE IT ON SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
2391-145015-0051 MANY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH SOME CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCED HER SISTER CASSANDRA TO BREAK THROUGH HER HABITUAL RETICENCE AND TO SPEAK OF IT
2391-145015-0052 WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
2391-145015-0053 AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
2391-145015-0054 ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I MIGHT ATTEMPT OF THE FAMILY LIFE AT STEVENTON WHICH CLOSED SOON AFTER I WAS BORN COULD BE LITTLE BETTER THAN A FANCY PIECE
2391-145015-0055 WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US AND SHOULD MISS MANY MORE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED EVERY HUNDRED YEARS AND ESPECIALLY A CENTURY LIKE THE LAST MARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCE IN WEALTH LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS WELL AS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS WHICH EMBELLISH OUR HOUSES
2391-145015-0056 MUST PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THEIR ASPECT THESE CHANGES ARE ALWAYS AT WORK THEY ARE GOING ON NOW BUT SO SILENTLY THAT WE TAKE NO NOTE OF THEM MEN SOON FORGET THE SMALL OBJECTS WHICH THEY LEAVE BEHIND THEM AS THEY DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM OF LIFE
2391-145015-0057 AS POPE SAYS NOR DOES LIFE'S STREAM FOR OBSERVATION STAY IT HURRIES ALL TOO FAST TO MARK THEIR WAY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS SUCH AS THE APPLICATIONS OF STEAM GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAY FIND THEIR PLACES IN HISTORY
2391-145015-0058 WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059 INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2391-145015-0060 BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
2391-145015-0061 NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
2391-145015-0062 THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
2391-145015-0063 AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE FAMILY DINNER FOR MANY GENERATIONS
2391-145015-0064 ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
2391-145015-0065 POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2391-145015-0066 AND WHEN MISSUS AUSTEN ADVISED HER TO PLANT THEM IN HER OWN GARDEN SHE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE VERY WELL FOR YOU GENTRY BUT THEY MUST BE TERRIBLY COSTLY TO REAR BUT A STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOMS
2391-145015-0067 WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO US LAMENTABLY SCANTY THERE WAS A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF CARPETING IN SITTING ROOMS BED ROOMS AND PASSAGES A PIANOFORTE OR RATHER A SPINNET OR HARPSICHORD WAS BY NO MEANS A NECESSARY APPENDAGE
2391-145015-0068 IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
2391-145015-0069 UNCOMFORTABLE ARTICLE THERE WERE NO DEEP EASY CHAIRS NOR OTHER APPLIANCES FOR LOUNGING FOR TO LIE DOWN OR EVEN TO LEAN BACK WAS A LUXURY PERMITTED ONLY TO OLD PERSONS OR INVALIDS
2391-145015-0070 AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
2391-145015-0071 WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0072 THE PERIODICALS AND ILLUSTRATED NEWSPAPERS ABOVE ALL
2391-145015-0073 A SMALL WRITING DESK WITH A SMALLER WORK BOX OR NETTING CASE WAS ALL THAT EACH YOUNG LADY CONTRIBUTED TO OCCUPY THE TABLE FOR THE LARGE FAMILY WORK BASKET THOUGH OFTEN PRODUCED IN THE PARLOUR LIVED IN THE CLOSET
2391-145015-0074 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
2391-145015-0075 AS IF IT WERE A NATURAL PRODUCTION WITH LESS FASTIDIOUSNESS AS TO THE QUALITY OF MUSIC LIGHTS AND FLOOR MANY COUNTRY TOWNS HAD A MONTHLY BALL THROUGHOUT THE WINTER IN SOME OF WHICH THE SAME APARTMENT SERVED FOR DANCING AND TEA ROOM
2391-145015-0076 TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
2391-145015-0077 FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
2391-145015-0078 AND MADE OF IMPORTANCE MANY THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BALL ROOMS OF THOSE DAYS HAVE NOW PASSED INTO OBLIVION THE BARBAROUS LAW WHICH CONFINED THE LADY TO ONE PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED BEFORE JANE WENT TO BALLS
2391-145015-0079 IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THIS CUSTOM WAS IN ONE RESPECT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GENTLEMAN INASMUCH AS IT RENDERED HIS DUTIES MORE PRACTICABLE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL UPON HIS PARTNER THE NEXT MORNING
2391-145015-0080 TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
2391-145015-0081 EXPRESSIVE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN OF MERRIMENT IT ABOUNDED IN FORMAL BOWS AND COURTESIES WITH MEASURED PACES FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND MANY COMPLICATED GYRATIONS
2391-145015-0082 IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
2391-145015-0083 THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
2391-145015-0084 THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF EACH WEAPON WAS CONSIDERED A TEST OF HIGH BREEDING THE CLOWNISH MAN WAS IN DANGER OF BEING TRIPPED UP BY HIS SWORD GETTING BETWEEN HIS LEGS
2391-145015-0085 AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THOSE LADIES WHO INTENDED TO DANCE MINUETS USED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM OTHERS BY WEARING A PARTICULAR KIND OF LAPPET ON THEIR HEAD DRESS I HAVE HEARD ALSO OF ANOTHER CURIOUS PROOF OF THE RESPECT IN WHICH THIS DANCE WAS HELD
2391-145015-0086 GLOVES IMMACULATELY CLEAN WERE CONSIDERED REQUISITE FOR ITS DUE PERFORMANCE WHILE GLOVES A LITTLE SOILED WERE THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A COUNTRY DANCE AND ACCORDINGLY SOME PRUDENT LADIES PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH TWO PAIRS FOR THEIR SEVERAL PURPOSES
2391-145015-0087 THE MINUET EXPIRED WITH THE LAST CENTURY BUT LONG AFTER IT HAD CEASED TO BE DANCED PUBLICLY IT WAS TAUGHT TO BOYS AND GIRLS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM A GRACEFUL CARRIAGE HORNPIPES COTILLONS AND REELS WERE OCCASIONALLY DANCED
2391-145015-0088 BUT THE CHIEF OCCUPATION OF THE EVENING WAS THE INTERMINABLE COUNTRY DANCE IN WHICH ALL COULD JOIN THIS DANCE PRESENTED A GREAT SHOW OF ENJOYMENT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS PECULIAR TROUBLES
2391-145015-0089 THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
2391-145015-0090 AND ESPECIALLY AS TO WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF CALLING AND LEADING OFF THE FIRST DANCE AND NO LITTLE INDIGNATION WAS FELT AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM WHEN ANY OF THE LEADING COUPLES RETIRED PREMATURELY FROM THEIR DUTIES AND DID NOT CONDESCEND TO DANCE UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE SET
2391-145015-0091 WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
2391-145015-0092 I AM TEMPTED TO ADD A LITTLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE OF PERSONAL HABITS IT MAY BE ASSERTED AS A GENERAL TRUTH THAT LESS WAS LEFT TO THE CHARGE AND DISCRETION OF SERVANTS AND MORE WAS DONE OR SUPERINTENDED BY THE MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
2391-145015-0093 WITH REGARD TO THE MISTRESSES IT IS I BELIEVE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THE TIME TO WHICH I REFER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY TOOK A PERSONAL PART IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF COOKERY AS WELL AS IN THE CONCOCTION OF HOME MADE WINES
2391-145015-0094 AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
2391-145015-0095 AS THAT THEY TOOK AN INTEREST IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS AND IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOW MANY SOURCES OF INTEREST ENJOYED BY THIS GENERATION WERE THEN CLOSED OR VERY SCANTILY OPENED TO LADIES A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THEM CARED MUCH FOR LITERATURE OR SCIENCE
2391-145015-0096 BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE RISING GENERATION ARE EQUALLY AWARE HOW MUCH GENTLEMEN ALSO DID FOR THEMSELVES IN THOSE TIMES
2391-145015-0097 THAN THEY ARE NOW MASTER'S EYE MAKES THE HORSE FAT AND IF YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED SERVE YOURSELF SOME GENTLEMEN TOOK PLEASURE IN BEING THEIR OWN GARDENERS PERFORMING ALL THE SCIENTIFIC AND SOME OF THE MANUAL WORK THEMSELVES
2391-145015-0098 WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0099 FOR IN THOSE DAYS SERVANTS HALLS WERE NOT COMMON IN THE HOUSES OF THE CLERGY AND THE SMALLER COUNTRY GENTRY IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT CATHERINE MORLAND SHOULD HAVE CONTRASTED THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE OFFICES AT NORTHANGER ABBEY WITH THE FEW SHAPELESS PANTRIES IN HER FATHER'S PARSONAGE
2391-145015-0100 A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
2391-145015-0101 IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
2391-145015-0102 IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS WORK TO MAKE A LONG COATED HUNTER DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND WAS OFTEN VERY IMPERFECTLY DONE OF COURSE SUCH THINGS WERE NOT PRACTISED BY THOSE WHO HAD GAMEKEEPERS AND STUD GROOMS AND PLENTY OF WELL TRAINED SERVANTS
2391-145015-0103 BUT THEY WERE PRACTISED BY MANY WHO WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY GENTLEMEN AND WHOSE GRANDSONS OCCUPYING THE SAME POSITION IN LIFE MAY PERHAPS BE ASTONISHED AT BEING TOLD THAT SUCH THINGS WERE
2391-145015-0104 OF COURSE THEY CANNOT BE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE SUCH DETAILS VARIED IN VARIOUS CIRCLES AND WERE CHANGED VERY GRADUALLY
2391-145015-0105 BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE DIFFERED A LITTLE FROM OURS
2391-145015-0106 IT MAY BE THAT USEFUL ARTICLES WHICH WOULD NOT NOW BE PRODUCED IN DRAWING ROOMS WERE HEMMED AND MARKED AND DARNED IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOUR BUT ALL THIS CONCERNED ONLY THE OUTER LIFE THERE WAS AS MUCH CULTIVATION AND REFINEMENT OF MIND AS NOW
2391-145015-0107 THE EARLY HOUR AT WHICH HOUNDS THEN MET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS
2391-145015-0108 FOR THEY HUNTED AT AN EARLY AGE IN A SCRAMBLING SORT OF WAY UPON ANY PONY OR DONKEY THAT THEY COULD PROCURE OR IN DEFAULT OF SUCH LUXURIES ON FOOT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SIR FRANCIS AUSTEN WHEN SEVEN YEARS OLD
2391-145015-0109 BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
2391-145015-0110 THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
2391-145015-0111 THE FUTURE ADMIRAL OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST HAVE CUT A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN THE HUNTING FIELD THE OTHER PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHEN THE ROADS WERE DIRTY THE SISTERS TOOK LONG WALKS IN PATTENS THIS DEFENCE AGAINST WET AND DIRT IS NOW SELDOM SEEN
2391-145015-0112 THE FEW THAT REMAIN ARE BANISHED FROM GOOD SOCIETY AND EMPLOYED ONLY IN MENIAL WORK BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE CELEBRATED IN POETRY AND CONSIDERED SO CLEVER A CONTRIVANCE THAT GAY IN HIS TRIVIA
2391-145015-0113 ASCRIBES THE INVENTION TO A GOD STIMULATED BY HIS PASSION FOR A MORTAL DAMSEL AND DERIVES THE NAME PATTEN FROM PATTY THE PATTEN NOW SUPPORTS EACH FRUGAL DAME WHICH FROM THE BLUE EYED PATTY TAKES THE NAME
2391-145015-0114 BUT MORTAL DAMSELS HAVE LONG AGO DISCARDED THE CLUMSY IMPLEMENT FIRST IT DROPPED ITS IRON RING AND BECAME A CLOG AFTERWARDS IT WAS FINED DOWN INTO THE PLIANT GALOSHE LIGHTER TO WEAR AND MORE EFFECTUAL TO PROTECT
2391-145015-0115 A NO LESS MANIFEST INSTANCE OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT THAN COWPER INDICATES WHEN HE TRACES THROUGH EIGHTY LINES OF POETRY HIS ACCOMPLISHED SOFA BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THREE LEGGED STOOL
2391-145015-0116 I ADD THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM WRITTEN BY JANE AUSTEN'S UNCLE MISTER LEIGH PERROT ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE MARRIAGE OF CAPTAIN FOOTE TO MISS PATTEN THROUGH THE ROUGH PATHS OF LIFE WITH A PATTEN YOUR GUARD MAY YOU SAFELY AND PLEASANTLY JOG
2391-145015-0117 MAY THE KNOT NEVER SLIP NOR THE RING PRESS TOO HARD NOR THE FOOT FIND THE PATTEN A CLOG AT THE TIME WHEN JANE AUSTEN LIVED AT STEVENTON A WORK WAS CARRIED ON IN THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECORDED BECAUSE IT HAS LONG CEASED TO EXIST
2391-145015-0118 THIS WAS A BETTER OCCUPATION FOR THEM THAN STRAW PLAITING
2391-145015-0119 AND DID NOT ADMIT OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VILLAGE THE IMPLEMENT USED WAS A LONG NARROW MACHINE OF WOOD RAISED ON LEGS FURNISHED AT ONE END WITH A LARGE WHEEL AND AT THE OTHER WITH A SPINDLE ON WHICH THE FLAX OR WOOL WAS LOOSELY WRAPPED
2391-145015-0120 BALLAD POETRY AND FAIRY TALES ARE FULL OF ALLUSIONS TO IT
2391-145015-0121 IT WAS THE LABOUR ASSIGNED TO THE EJECTED NUNS BY THE ROUGH EARL WHO SAID GO SPIN YE JADES GO SPIN IT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT AT WHICH ROMAN MATRONS AND GRECIAN PRINCESSES PRESIDED AMONGST THEIR HANDMAIDS
2391-145015-0122 HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
5678-43303-0000 MABEL REMEMBERED HER HUSBAND'S ADVICE TO WATCH AND FOR A FEW DAYS DID HER BEST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT ALARMED HER THE OLD LADY WAS A LITTLE QUIET PERHAPS BUT WENT ABOUT HER MINUTE AFFAIRS AS USUAL SHE ASKED THE GIRL TO READ TO HER SOMETIMES
5678-43303-0001 SHE PACKED HIS BAG WITH HER OWN HANDS SET OUT HIS FURS FOR THE SWIFT FLIGHT TO PARIS AND WAVED TO HIM FROM THE WINDOW AS HE WENT DOWN THE LITTLE PATH TOWARDS THE JUNCTION HE WOULD BE GONE THREE DAYS HE SAID IT WAS ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY THAT SHE FELL ILL
5678-43303-0002 AND MABEL RUNNING UPSTAIRS IN ALARM AT THE MESSAGE OF THE SERVANT FOUND HER RATHER FLUSHED AND AGITATED IN HER CHAIR IT IS NOTHING MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY TREMULOUSLY AND SHE ADDED THE DESCRIPTION OF A SYMPTOM OR TWO
5678-43303-0003 SHE WAS SINCERELY FOND OF THE OLD LADY AND HAD ALWAYS FOUND HER PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE A QUIET SORT OF DELIGHT THE EFFECT OF HER UPON THE MIND WAS AS THAT OF AN EASY CHAIR UPON THE BODY THE OLD LADY WAS SO TRANQUIL AND HUMAN
5678-43303-0004 SO ABSORBED IN SMALL EXTERNAL MATTERS SO REMINISCENT NOW AND THEN OF THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH SO UTTERLY WITHOUT RESENTMENT OR PEEVISHNESS
5678-43303-0005 SHE FOUND LESS DIFFICULTY IN CONTEMPLATING THE END OF A VIGOROUS SOUL FOR IN THAT CASE SHE IMAGINED A KIND OF ENERGETIC RUSH OF FORCE BACK INTO THE ORIGIN OF THINGS
5678-43303-0006 HER WHOLE POINT SO TO SPEAK LAY IN THE DELICATE LITTLE FABRIC OF PERSONALITY BUILT OUT OF FRAGILE THINGS INTO AN ENTITY FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THE SUM OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS THE DEATH OF A FLOWER REFLECTED MABEL IS SADDER THAN THE DEATH OF A LION
5678-43303-0007 THE BREAKING OF A PIECE OF CHINA MORE IRREPARABLE THAN THE RUIN OF A PALACE IT IS SYNCOPE SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN HE CAME IN SHE MAY DIE AT ANY TIME SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS THERE IS NO NEED TO TELEGRAPH FOR MISTER BRAND
5678-43303-0008 HE MADE A LITTLE DEPRECATING MOVEMENT WITH HIS HANDS IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE WILL DIE IT
5678-43303-0009 SHE ASKED NO NO SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS I SAID HE ADDED A WORD OR TWO OF ADVICE AS TO THE USE OF THE OXYGEN INJECTOR AND WENT AWAY THE OLD LADY WAS LYING QUIETLY IN BED WHEN THE GIRL WENT UP AND PUT OUT A WRINKLED HAND
5678-43303-0010 WELL MY DEAR SHE ASKED IT IS JUST A LITTLE WEAKNESS MOTHER YOU MUST LIE QUIET AND DO NOTHING SHALL I READ TO YOU NO MY DEAR I WILL THINK A LITTLE IT WAS NO PART OF MABEL'S IDEA TO DUTY TO TELL HER THAT SHE WAS IN DANGER
5678-43303-0011 FOR THERE WAS NO PAST TO SET STRAIGHT NO JUDGE TO BE CONFRONTED DEATH WAS AN ENDING NOT A BEGINNING IT WAS A PEACEFUL GOSPEL AT LEAST IT BECAME PEACEFUL AS SOON AS THE END HAD COME
5678-43303-0012 SO THE GIRL WENT DOWNSTAIRS ONCE MORE WITH A QUIET LITTLE ACHE AT HER HEART THAT REFUSED TO BE STILL WHAT A STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL THING DEATH WAS SHE TOLD HERSELF THIS RESOLUTION OF A CHORD THAT HAD HUNG SUSPENDED FOR THIRTY FIFTY OR SEVENTY YEARS
5678-43303-0013 BACK AGAIN INTO THE STILLNESS OF THE HUGE INSTRUMENT THAT WAS ALL IN ALL TO ITSELF THOSE SAME NOTES WOULD BE STRUCK AGAIN WERE BEING STRUCK AGAIN EVEN NOW ALL OVER THE WORLD THOUGH WITH AN INFINITE DELICACY OF DIFFERENCE IN THE TOUCH
5678-43303-0014 BUT THAT PARTICULAR EMOTION WAS GONE IT WAS FOOLISH TO THINK THAT IT WAS SOUNDING ETERNALLY ELSEWHERE FOR THERE WAS NO ELSEWHERE SHE TOO HERSELF WOULD CEASE ONE DAY LET HER SEE TO IT THAT THE TONE WAS PURE AND LOVELY
5678-43303-0015 MISTER PHILLIPS ARRIVED THE NEXT MORNING AS USUAL JUST AS MABEL HAD LEFT THE OLD LADY'S ROOM AND ASKED NEWS OF HER SHE IS A LITTLE BETTER I THINK SAID MABEL SHE MUST BE VERY QUIET ALL DAY THE SECRETARY BOWED AND TURNED ASIDE INTO OLIVER'S ROOM
5678-43303-0016 WHERE A HEAP OF LETTERS LAY TO BE ANSWERED A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER AS MABEL WENT UPSTAIRS ONCE MORE SHE MET MISTER PHILLIPS COMING DOWN HE LOOKED A LITTLE FLUSHED UNDER HIS SALLOW SKIN MISSUS BRAND SENT FOR ME HE SAID SHE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER MISTER OLIVER WOULD BE BACK TO NIGHT
5678-43303-0017 HE WILL WILL HE NOT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD MISTER BRAND SAID HE WOULD BE HERE FOR A LATE DINNER HE WILL REACH LONDON AT NINETEEN AND IS THERE ANY OTHER NEWS HE COMPRESSED HIS LIPS THERE ARE RUMOURS HE SAID MISTER BRAND WIRED TO ME AN HOUR AGO
5678-43303-0018 HE SEEMED MOVED AT SOMETHING AND MABEL LOOKED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT IT IS NOT EASTERN NEWS SHE ASKED HIS EYEBROWS WRINKLED A LITTLE
5678-43303-0019 SHE WAS NOT OFFENDED FOR SHE TRUSTED HER HUSBAND TOO WELL BUT SHE WENT ON INTO THE SICK ROOM WITH HER HEART BEATING THE OLD LADY TOO SEEMED EXCITED SHE LAY IN BED WITH A CLEAR FLUSH IN HER WHITE CHEEKS AND HARDLY SMILED AT ALL TO THE GIRL'S GREETING
5678-43303-0020 SAID MABEL OLD MISSUS BRAND LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY AN INSTANT BUT SAID NOTHING DON'T EXCITE YOURSELF MOTHER OLIVER WILL BE BACK TO NIGHT THE OLD LADY DREW A LONG BREATH DON'T TROUBLE ABOUT ME MY DEAR SHE SAID I SHALL DO VERY WELL NOW
5678-43303-0021 HE WILL BE BACK TO DINNER WILL HE NOT IF THE VOLOR IS NOT LATE NOW MOTHER ARE YOU READY FOR BREAKFAST MABEL PASSED AN AFTERNOON OF CONSIDERABLE AGITATION IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
5678-43303-0022 THE SECRETARY WHO BREAKFASTED WITH HER IN THE PARLOUR LOOKING ON TO THE GARDEN HAD APPEARED STRANGELY EXCITED HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD BE AWAY THE REST OF THE DAY MISTER OLIVER HAD GIVEN HIM HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE HAD REFRAINED FROM ALL DISCUSSION OF THE EASTERN QUESTION
5678-43303-0023 AND HE HAD GIVEN HER NO NEWS OF THE PARIS CONVENTION HE ONLY REPEATED THAT MISTER OLIVER WOULD BE BACK THAT NIGHT THEN HE HAD GONE OF IN A HURRY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE OLD LADY SEEMED ASLEEP WHEN THE GIRL WENT UP AFTERWARDS AND MABEL DID NOT LIKE TO DISTURB HER
5678-43303-0024 NEITHER DID SHE LIKE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SO SHE WALKED BY HERSELF IN THE GARDEN THINKING AND HOPING AND FEARING TILL THE LONG SHADOW LAY ACROSS THE PATH AND THE TUMBLED PLATFORM OF ROOFS WAS BATHED IN A DUSTY GREEN HAZE FROM THE WEST
5678-43303-0025 AS SHE CAME IN SHE TOOK UP THE EVENING PAPER BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS THERE EXCEPT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CONVENTION WOULD CLOSE THAT AFTERNOON TWENTY O'CLOCK CAME BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF OLIVER THE PARIS VOLOR SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AN HOUR BEFORE
5678-43303-0026 BUT MABEL STARING OUT INTO THE DARKENING HEAVENS HAD SEEN THE STARS COME OUT LIKE JEWELS ONE BY ONE
5678-43303-0027 OF COURSE SHE MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT THERE WAS NO DEPENDING ON ITS EXACT COURSE BUT SHE HAD SEEN IT A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE AND WONDERED UNREASONABLY WHY SHE HAD NOT SEEN IT NOW BUT SHE WOULD NOT SIT DOWN TO DINNER AND PACED UP AND DOWN IN HER WHITE DRESS
5678-43303-0028 TURNING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE WINDOW LISTENING TO THE SOFT RUSH OF THE TRAINS THE FAINT HOOTS FROM THE TRACK AND THE MUSICAL CHORDS FROM THE JUNCTION A MILE AWAY THE LIGHTS WERE UP BY NOW AND THE VAST SWEEP OF THE TOWNS LOOKED LIKE FAIRYLAND BETWEEN THE EARTHLY LIGHT
5678-43303-0029 AND THE HEAVENLY DARKNESS WHY DID NOT OLIVER COME OR AT LEAST LET HER KNOW WHY HE DID NOT ONCE SHE WENT UPSTAIRS MISERABLY ANXIOUS HERSELF TO REASSURE THE OLD LADY AND FOUND HER AGAIN VERY DROWSY HE IS NOT COME SHE SAID
5678-43303-0030 I DARE SAY HE MAY BE KEPT IN PARIS THE OLD FACE ON THE PILLOW NODDED AND MURMURED AND MABEL WENT DOWN AGAIN IT WAS NOW AN HOUR AFTER DINNER TIME OH THERE WERE A HUNDRED THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE KEPT HIM
5678-43303-0031 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN LATER THAN THIS HE MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE VOLOR HE MEANT TO CATCH THE CONVENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROLONGED HE MIGHT BE EXHAUSTED AND THINK IT BETTER TO SLEEP IN PARIS AFTER ALL AND HAVE FORGOTTEN TO WIRE
5678-43303-0032 HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE WIRED TO MISTER PHILLIPS AND THE SECRETARY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE SHE WENT AT LAST HOPELESSLY TO THE TELEPHONE AND LOOKED AT IT THERE IT WAS THAT ROUND SILENT MONTH THAT LITTLE ROW OF LABELLED BUTTONS
5678-43303-0033 SHE HALF DECIDED TO TOUCH THEM ONE BY ONE AND INQUIRE WHETHER ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF HER HUSBAND THERE WAS HIS CLUB HIS OFFICE IN WHITEHALL MISTER PHILLIPS'S HOUSE PARLIAMENT HOUSE AND THE REST BUT SHE HESITATED TELLING HERSELF TO BE PATIENT
5678-43303-0034 OLIVER HATED INTERFERENCE AND HE WOULD SURELY SOON REMEMBER AND RELIEVE HER ANXIETY THEN EVEN AS SHE TURNED AWAY THE BELL RANG SHARPLY AND A WHITE LABEL FLASHED INTO SIGHT WHITEHALL SHE PRESSED THE CORRESPONDING BUTTON AND HER HAND SHAKING SO MUCH
5678-43303-0035 THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY HOLD THE RECEIVER TO HER EAR SHE LISTENED WHO IS THERE HER HEART LEAPED AT THE SOUND OF HER HUSBAND'S VOICE TINY AND MINUTE ACROSS THE MILES OF WIRE I MABEL SHE SAID ALONE HERE
5678-43303-0036 I AM BACK ALL IS WELL NOW LISTEN CAN YOU HEAR YES YES THE BEST HAS HAPPENED IT IS ALL OVER IN THE EAST FELSENBURGH HAS DONE IT NOW LISTEN I CANNOT COME HOME TO NIGHT IT WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN PAUL'S HOUSE IN TWO HOURS FROM NOW
5678-43303-0037 WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE PRESS COME UP HERE TO ME AT ONCE YOU MUST BE PRESENT CAN YOU HEAR OH YES COME THEN AT ONCE IT WILL BE THE GREATEST THING IN HISTORY TELL NO ONE COME BEFORE THE RUSH BEGINS IN HALF AN HOUR THE WAY WILL BE STOPPED OLIVER
5678-43303-0038 YES QUICK MOTHER IS ILL SHALL I LEAVE HER HOW ILL OH NO IMMEDIATE DANGER THE DOCTOR HAS SEEN HER THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT YES COME THEN WE WILL GO BACK TO NIGHT ANYHOW THEN
5678-43302-0000 OLIVER TOLD THEM THE EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR THAT EVENING AT HOME LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH ONE ARM BANDAGED AND IN A SLING THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET NEAR HIM AT THE TIME THE EXCITEMENT IN THE SQUARE HAD BEEN TOO FIERCE
5678-43302-0001 BUT A MESSENGER HAD COME TO HIS WIFE WITH THE NEWS THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY WOUNDED AND WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE DOCTORS HE WAS A CATHOLIC EXPLAINED THE DRAWN FACED OLIVER HE MUST HAVE COME READY FOR HIS REPEATER WAS FOUND LOADED
5678-43302-0002 WELL THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR A PRIEST THIS TIME MABEL NODDED SLOWLY SHE HAD READ OF THE MAN'S FATE ON THE PLACARDS HE WAS KILLED TRAMPLED AND STRANGLED INSTANTLY SAID OLIVER I DID WHAT I COULD YOU SAW ME
5678-43302-0003 BUT WELL I DARE SAY IT WAS MORE MERCIFUL BUT YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY ANXIOUSLY FROM HER CORNER I CALLED OUT TO THEM MOTHER BUT THEY WOULDN'T HEAR ME
5678-43302-0004 MABEL LEANED FORWARD OLIVER I KNOW THIS SOUNDS STUPID OF ME BUT BUT I WISH THEY HAD NOT KILLED HIM OLIVER SMILED AT HER HE KNEW THIS TENDER TRAIT IN HER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT IF THEY HAD NOT
5678-43302-0005 SHE SAID THEN SHE BROKE OFF AND SAT BACK WHY DID HE SHOOT JUST THEN SHE ASKED OLIVER TURNED HIS EYES FOR AN INSTANT TOWARDS HIS MOTHER BUT SHE WAS KNITTING TRANQUILLY THEN HE ANSWERED WITH A CURIOUS DELIBERATENESS
5678-43302-0006 I SAID THAT BRAITHWAITE HAD DONE MORE FOR THE WORLD BY ONE SPEECH THAN JESUS AND ALL HIS SAINTS PUT TOGETHER HE WAS AWARE THAT THE KNITTING NEEDLES STOPPED FOR A SECOND THEN THEY WENT ON AGAIN AS BEFORE
5678-43302-0007 BUT HE MUST HAVE MEANT TO DO IT ANYHOW CONTINUED OLIVER HOW DO THEY KNOW HE WAS A CATHOLIC ASKED THE GIRL AGAIN THERE WAS A ROSARY ON HIM AND THEN HE JUST HAD TIME TO CALL ON HIS GOD AND NOTHING MORE IS KNOWN
5678-43302-0008 NOTHING MORE HE WAS WELL DRESSED THOUGH OLIVER LEANED BACK A LITTLE WEARILY AND CLOSED HIS EYES HIS ARM STILL THROBBED INTOLERABLY BUT HE WAS VERY HAPPY AT HEART IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD BEEN WOUNDED BY A FANATIC
5678-43302-0009 BUT HE WAS NOT SORRY TO BEAR PAIN IN SUCH A CAUSE AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE SYMPATHY OF ENGLAND WAS WITH HIM MISTER PHILLIPS EVEN NOW WAS BUSY IN THE NEXT ROOM ANSWERING THE TELEGRAMS THAT POURED IN EVERY MOMENT
5678-43302-0010 CALDECOTT THE PRIME MINISTER MAXWELL SNOWFORD AND A DOZEN OTHERS HAD WIRED INSTANTLY THEIR CONGRATULATIONS AND FROM EVERY PART OF ENGLAND STREAMED IN MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE IT WAS AN IMMENSE STROKE FOR THE COMMUNISTS
5678-43302-0011 SPEAKING IN DEFENCE OF HIS PRINCIPLES IT WAS AN INCALCULABLE GAIN FOR THEM AND LOSS FOR THE INDIVIDUALISTS THAT CONFESSORS WERE NOT ALL ON ONE SIDE AFTER ALL
5678-43302-0012 THE HUGE ELECTRIC PLACARDS OVER LONDON HAD WINKED OUT THE FACTS IN ESPERANTO AS OLIVER STEPPED INTO THE TRAIN AT TWILIGHT OLIVER BRAND WOUNDED CATHOLIC ASSAILANT INDIGNATION OF THE COUNTRY
5678-43302-0013 WELL DESERVED FATE OF ASSASSIN HE WAS PLEASED TOO THAT HE HONESTLY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO SAVE THE MAN EVEN IN THAT MOMENT OF SUDDEN AND ACUTE PAIN HE HAD CRIED OUT FOR A FAIR TRIAL BUT HE HAD BEEN TOO LATE
5678-43302-0014 HE HAD SEEN THE STARTING EYES ROLL UP IN THE CRIMSON FACE AND THE HORRID GRIN COME AND GO AS THE HANDS HAD CLUTCHED AND TORN AT HIS THROAT THEN THE FACE HAD VANISHED AND A HEAVY TRAMPLING BEGAN WHERE IT HAD DISAPPEARED OH
5678-43302-0015 THERE WAS SOME PASSION AND LOYALTY LEFT IN ENGLAND HIS MOTHER GOT UP PRESENTLY AND WENT OUT STILL WITHOUT A WORD AND MABEL TURNED TO HIM LAYING A HAND ON HIS KNEE ARE YOU TOO TIRED TO TALK MY DEAR HE OPENED HIS EYES
5678-43302-0016 OF COURSE NOT MY DARLING WHAT IS IT WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE EFFECT HE RAISED HIMSELF A LITTLE LOOKING OUT AS USUAL THROUGH THE DARKENING WINDOWS ON TO THAT ASTONISHING VIEW
5678-43302-0017 EVERYWHERE NOW LIGHTS WERE GLOWING A SEA OF MELLOW MOONS JUST ABOVE THE HOUSES AND ABOVE THE MYSTERIOUS HEAVY BLUE OF A SUMMER EVENING THE EFFECT HE SAID IT CAN BE NOTHING BUT GOOD IT WAS TIME THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
5678-43302-0018 MY DEAR I FEEL VERY DOWNCAST SOMETIMES AS YOU KNOW WELL I DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN AFRAID SOMETIMES THAT WE WERE LOSING ALL OUR SPIRIT AND THAT THE OLD TORIES WERE PARTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY PROPHESIED WHAT COMMUNISM WOULD DO
5678-43302-0019 BUT AFTER THIS WELL WELL WE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE CAN SHED OUR BLOOD TOO IT IS IN THE NICK OF TIME TOO JUST AT THE CRISIS I DON'T WANT TO EXAGGERATE IT IS ONLY A SCRATCH BUT IT WAS SO DELIBERATE AND
5678-43302-0020 AND SO DRAMATIC THE POOR DEVIL COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A WORSE MOMENT PEOPLE WON'T FORGET IT MABEL'S EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE YOU POOR DEAR SHE SAID ARE YOU IN PAIN NOT MUCH BESIDES CHRIST
5678-43302-0021 IF ONLY THIS INFERNAL EASTERN AFFAIR WOULD END HE KNEW HE WAS FEVERISH AND IRRITABLE AND MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO DRIVE IT DOWN OH MY DEAR HE WENT ON FLUSHED A LITTLE
5678-43302-0022 IF THEY WOULD NOT BE SUCH HEAVY FOOLS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND YES OLIVER THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A GLORIOUS THING IT ALL IS HUMANITY LIFE TRUTH AT LAST AND THE DEATH OF FOLLY BUT HAVEN'T I TOLD THEM A HUNDRED TIMES
5678-43302-0023 SHE LOVED TO SEE HIM LIKE THIS HIS CONFIDENT FLUSHED FACE THE ENTHUSIASM IN HIS BLUE EYES AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PAIN PRICKED HER FEELING WITH PASSION SHE BENT FORWARD AND KISSED HIM SUDDENLY MY DEAR I AM SO PROUD OF YOU OH OLIVER HE SAID NOTHING
5678-43302-0024 BUT SHE COULD SEE WHAT SHE LOVED TO SEE THAT RESPONSE TO HER OWN HEART AND SO THEY SAT IN SILENCE WHILE THE SKY DARKENED YET MORE AND THE CLICK OF THE WRITER IN THE NEXT ROOM TOLD THEM THAT THE WORLD WAS ALIVE AND THAT THEY HAD A SHARE IN ITS AFFAIRS
5678-43302-0025 OLIVER STIRRED PRESENTLY DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING JUST NOW SWEETHEART WHEN I SAID THAT ABOUT JESUS CHRIST SHE STOPPED KNITTING FOR A MOMENT SAID THE GIRL HE NODDED YOU SAW THAT TOO THEN
5678-43302-0026 MABEL DO YOU THINK SHE IS FALLING BACK OH SHE IS GETTING OLD SAID THE GIRL LIGHTLY OF COURSE SHE LOOKS BACK A LITTLE BUT YOU DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE TOO AWFUL SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NO
5678-43302-0027 NO MY DEAR YOU'RE EXCITED AND TIRED IT'S JUST A LITTLE SENTIMENT OLIVER I DON'T THINK I WOULD SAY THAT KIND OF THING BEFORE HER BUT SHE HEARS IT EVERYWHERE NOW NO SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
5678-43302-0028 SHE CAN'T GET IT OUT OF HER HEAD EVEN AFTER FIFTY YEARS WELL WATCH HER WON'T YOU BY THE WAY YES THERE'S A LITTLE MORE NEWS FROM THE EAST THEY SAY FELSENBURGH'S RUNNING THE WHOLE THING NOW THE EMPIRE IS SENDING HIM EVERYWHERE
5678-43302-0029 TOBOLSK BENARES YAKUTSK EVERYWHERE AND HE'S BEEN TO AUSTRALIA MABEL SAT UP BRISKLY ISN'T THAT VERY HOPEFUL I SUPPOSE SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE SUFIS ARE WINNING BUT FOR HOW LONG IS ANOTHER QUESTION
5678-43302-0030 BESIDES THE TROOPS DON'T DISPERSE AND EUROPE EUROPE IS ARMING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE I HEAR WE ARE TO MEET THE POWERS NEXT WEEK AT PARIS I MUST GO YOUR ARM MY DEAR MY ARM MUST GET WELL IT WILL HAVE TO GO WITH ME ANYHOW
5678-43302-0031 TELL ME SOME MORE THERE IS NO MORE BUT IT IS JUST AS CERTAIN AS IT CAN BE THAT THIS IS THE CRISIS IF THE EAST CAN BE PERSUADED TO HOLD ITS HAND NOW IT WILL NEVER BE LIKELY TO RAISE IT AGAIN IT WILL MEAN FREE TRADE ALL OVER THE WORLD I SUPPOSE
5678-43302-0032 AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING BUT IF NOT WELL IF NOT THERE WILL BE A CATASTROPHE SUCH AS NEVER HAS BEEN EVEN IMAGINED
5678-43302-0033 THESE NEW BENNINSCHEIN EXPLOSIVES WILL MAKE CERTAIN OF THAT BUT IS IT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THE EAST HAS GOT THEM ABSOLUTELY BENNINSCHEIN SOLD THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY TO EAST AND WEST THEN HE DIED LUCKILY FOR HIM MABEL HAD HEARD THIS KIND OF TALK BEFORE
5678-43302-0034 BUT HER IMAGINATION SIMPLY REFUSED TO GRASP IT A DUEL OF EAST AND WEST UNDER THESE NEW CONDITIONS WAS AN UNTHINKABLE THING THERE HAD BEEN NO EUROPEAN WAR WITHIN LIVING MEMORY AND THE EASTERN WARS OF THE LAST CENTURY HAD BEEN UNDER THE OLD CONDITIONS
5678-43302-0035 NOW IF TALES WERE TRUE ENTIRE TOWNS WOULD BE DESTROYED WITH A SINGLE SHELL THE NEW CONDITIONS WERE UNIMAGINABLE MILITARY EXPERTS PROPHESIED EXTRAVAGANTLY CONTRADICTING ONE ANOTHER ON VITAL POINTS
5678-43302-0036 THE WHOLE PROCEDURE OF WAR WAS A MATTER OF THEORY THERE WERE NO PRECEDENTS WITH WHICH TO COMPARE IT IT WAS AS IF ARCHERS DISPUTED AS TO THE RESULTS OF CORDITE ONLY ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EAST HAD EVERY MODERN ENGINE AND AS REGARDS MALE POPULATION
5678-43302-0037 HALF AS MUCH AGAIN AS THE REST OF THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER AND THE CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN FROM THESE PREMISSES WAS NOT REASSURING TO ENGLAND BUT IMAGINATION SIMPLY REFUSED TO SPEAK THE DAILY PAPERS HAD A SHORT CAREFUL LEADING ARTICLE EVERY DAY
5678-43302-0038 FOUNDED UPON THE SCRAPS OF NEWS THAT STOLE OUT FROM THE CONFERENCES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD FELSENBURGH'S NAME APPEARED MORE FREQUENTLY THAN EVER OTHERWISE THERE SEEMED TO BE A KIND OF HUSH NOTHING SUFFERED VERY MUCH TRADE WENT ON
5678-43302-0039 EUROPEAN STOCKS WERE NOT APPRECIABLY LOWER THAN USUAL MEN STILL BUILT HOUSES MARRIED WIVES BEGAT SONS AND DAUGHTERS DID THEIR BUSINESS AND WENT TO THE THEATRE FOR THE MERE REASON THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD IN ANYTHING ELSE THEY COULD NEITHER SAVE NOR PRECIPITATE THE SITUATION
5678-43302-0040 IT WAS ON TOO LARGE A SCALE OCCASIONALLY PEOPLE WENT MAD PEOPLE WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN GOADING THEIR IMAGINATION TO A HEIGHT WHENCE A GLIMPSE OF REALITY COULD BE OBTAINED AND THERE WAS A DIFFUSED ATMOSPHERE OF TENSENESS BUT THAT WAS ALL
831-130746-0000 THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
831-130746-0001 THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
831-130746-0002 THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
831-130746-0003 THEN STEPHEN THE WAITER WHO HAD SHOWN HOOPDRIVER UP CAME DOWN AND LIT WONDERFUL LIGHTS AND STARTED QUITE A FRESH DISCUSSION BY THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH THAT TURNED TEN MINUTES INTO A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION
831-130746-0004 MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
831-130746-0005 INCREDULOUS EYES STARED INTO ONE ANOTHER'S IN THE BAR AS HIS PACES MUFFLED BY THE STAIR CARPET WENT UP TO THE LANDING TURNED REACHED THE PASSAGE AND WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM OVERHEAD
831-130746-0006 IT WASN'T THAT ONE AT ALL MISS SAID THE OSTLER I'D SWEAR WELL THAT'S MISTER BEAUMONT SAID THE BARMAID ANYHOW THEIR CONVERSATION HUNG COMATOSE IN THE AIR SWITCHED UP BY BECHAMEL

831-130746-0018 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
831-130746-0019 AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
831-130746-0020 KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS
831-130746-0021 HE BANGED THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR WITH HIS FIST AND SWORE AGAIN
831-130746-0022 I BECHAMEL WHEN WITH AN ABRUPT TAP AND PROMPT OPENING OF THE DOOR STEPHEN ENTERED WITH THE BOURBON
831-130746-0023 THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY
831-130746-0024 THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SULLIED OUR MODEST BUT TRUTHFUL PAGES WE LEAVE THE EAGER LITTLE GROUP IN THE BAR OF THE VICUNA HOTEL WE LEAVE ALL BOGNOR AS WE HAVE LEFT ALL CHICHESTER
831-130746-0025 AND MIDHURST AND HASLEMERE AND GUILDFORD AND RIPLEY AND PUTNEY AND FOLLOW THIS DEAR FOOL OF A HOOPDRIVER OF OURS AND HIS YOUNG LADY IN GREY OUT UPON THE MOONLIGHT ROAD HOW THEY RODE
831-130746-0026 HOW THEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER AND THEIR BREATH CAME FAST AND HOW EVERY SHADOW WAS ANTICIPATION AND EVERY NOISE PURSUIT FOR ALL THAT FLIGHT MISTER HOOPDRIVER WAS IN THE WORLD OF ROMANCE HAD A POLICEMAN INTERVENED BECAUSE THEIR LAMPS WERE NOT LIT
831-130746-0027 HOOPDRIVER HAD CUT HIM DOWN AND RIDDEN ON AFTER THE FASHION OF A HERO BORN HAD BECHAMEL ARISEN IN THE WAY WITH RAPIERS FOR A DUEL HOOPDRIVER HAD FOUGHT AS ONE TO WHOM AGINCOURT WAS A REALITY AND DRAPERY A DREAM
831-130746-0028 IT WAS RESCUE ELOPEMENT GLORY AND SHE BY THE SIDE OF HIM HE HAD SEEN HER FACE IN SHADOW
831-130746-0029 HE HAD SEEN HER TROUBLED AND HER EYES BRIGHT WITH TEARS BUT WHAT LIGHT IS THERE LIGHTING A FACE LIKE HERS TO COMPARE WITH THE SOFT GLAMOUR OF THE MIDSUMMER MOON THE ROAD TURNED NORTHWARD GOING ROUND THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGNOR
831-130746-0030 THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
831-130746-0031 THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
831-130746-0032 AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
831-130746-0033 HIS MIND BECAME AN ENORMOUS APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION THE NIGHT WAS A WARM WHITE SILENCE SAVE FOR THE SUBTILE RUNNING OF THEIR CHAINS
831-130746-0034 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
831-130746-0035 AND NOW THEY FACED NORTHWARDS AND THE SOFT COLD LIGHT PASSED CARESSINGLY OVER HER HAIR AND TOUCHED HER BROW AND CHEEK THERE IS A MAGIC QUALITY IN MOONSHINE IT TOUCHES ALL THAT IS SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT IS HIDDEN
831-130746-0036 IT HAS CREATED THE FAIRIES WHOM THE SUNLIGHT KILLS AND FAIRYLAND RISES AGAIN IN OUR HEARTS AT THE SIGHT OF IT THE VOICES OF THE FILMY ROUTE
831-130746-0037 WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE
831-130746-0038 SHE WHO HAS SPIRITUALISED THE WORLD ALONE SAVE FOR TWO ATTENDANT STEADY SHINING STARS AND IN SILENCE UNDER HER BENIGN INFLUENCE UNDER THE BENEDICTION OF HER LIGHT RODE OUR TWO WANDERERS SIDE BY SIDE THROUGH THE TRANSFIGURED AND TRANSFIGURING NIGHT
831-130746-0039 NOWHERE WAS THE MOON SHINING QUITE SO BRIGHTLY AS IN MISTER HOOPDRIVER'S SKULL AT THE TURNINGS OF THE ROAD HE MADE HIS DECISIONS WITH AN AIR OF PROFOUND PROMPTITUDE AND QUITE HAPHAZARD THE RIGHT HE WOULD SAY OR AGAIN
831-130746-0040 THE LEFT AS ONE WHO KNEW SO IT WAS THAT IN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR THEY CAME ABRUPTLY DOWN A LITTLE LANE FULL TILT UPON THE SEA
831-130746-0041 HULLO SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER SOTTO VOCE THEY DISMOUNTED ABRUPTLY STUNTED OAKS AND THORNS ROSE OUT OF THE HAZE OF MOONLIGHT THAT WAS TANGLED IN THE HEDGE ON EITHER SIDE

831-130746-0046 PROMISED TO HELP AND PROTECT ME I WAS UNHAPPY AT HOME NEVER MIND WHY A STEPMOTHER IDLE UNOCCUPIED HINDERED CRAMPED THAT IS ENOUGH PERHAPS THEN HE CAME INTO MY LIFE AND TALKED TO ME OF ART AND LITERATURE AND SET MY BRAIN ON FIRE

831-130746-0051 GRAVE AND INTENT HOW COULD SHE EVER HAVE THOUGHT HIM COMMON OR ABSURD BUT YOU MUST TELL ME YOUR NAME BROTHER SHE SAID ER CARRINGTON SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER AFTER A MOMENTARY PAUSE
831-130746-0052 WHO WOULD BE HOOPDRIVER ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS BUT THE CHRISTIAN NAME CHRISTIAN NAME MY CHRISTIAN NAME WELL CHRIS HE SNAPPED HIS LAMP AND STOOD UP IF YOU WILL HOLD MY MACHINE I WILL LIGHT YOURS HE SAID
831-130746-0053 THE MUTE EMOTION OF HIS FACE AFFECTED HER STRANGELY SHE HAD TO SPEAK
831-130746-0054 SHE SAID WITH A LAUGH TO BREAK THE INTENSITY HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND SHUT IT AGAIN AND WITH A SUDDEN WINCING OF HIS FEATURES ABRUPTLY TURNED AND BENT DOWN TO OPEN THE LANTERN IN FRONT OF HER MACHINE SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HIM
831-130746-0055 ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON
831-130746-0056 AND IT WAS CHIEFLY BY GOOD LUCK AND THE FACT THAT MOST ROADS ABOUT A TOWN CONVERGE THEREUPON THAT CHICHESTER WAS AT LAST ATTAINED IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS THOUGH EVERYONE HAD GONE TO BED BUT THE RED HOTEL STILL GLOWED YELLOW AND WARM
831-130746-0057 BUT THAT NIGHT HE WAS IN THE MOOD TO DARE ANYTHING SO YOU FOUND YOUR YOUNG LADY AT LAST SAID THE OSTLER OF THE RED HOTEL

831-130746-0060 BUT THIS WAS LIVING INDEED HE TOLD HIMSELF
3607-29116-0000 LAURA WENT DOWN STAIRS KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR AND ENTERED SCARCELY WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ALONE WITH AN OPEN BIBLE IN HIS HAND UPSIDE DOWN LAURA SMILED AND SAID FORGETTING HER ACQUIRED CORRECTNESS OF SPEECH IT IS ONLY ME

3607-29116-0008 AND FOR THE GOOD OF THE COLORED RACE MUCH AS I AM INTERESTED IN THE HEIRS OF THIS PROPERTY AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM SUCCEED LAURA LOOKED A LITTLE INCREDULOUS AND THE SENATOR PROCEEDED DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME I DON'T DENY THAT IT IS FOR THE INTEREST OF ALL OF US THAT THIS BILL SHOULD GO THROUGH AND IT WILL
3607-29116-0009 I HAVE NO CONCEALMENTS FROM YOU BUT I HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GUIDE I NEVER PUSH A PRIVATE INTEREST IF IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED BY SOME LARGER PUBLIC GOOD

3607-29116-0014 I EXPECT TO SEE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE TO DAY MISTER BUCKSTONE
3607-29116-0015 BUT HE HAS CHARITABLE IMPULSES IF WE SECURE HIM WE SHALL HAVE A FAVORABLE REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE
3607-29116-0016 OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE BALLOON IS A WHOLE HEARTED FELLOW I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
3607-29116-0017 HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS NOT EXACTLY HE SAID SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID ASKED LAURA GLANCING FURTIVELY AT HIM CERTAINLY HE SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A GOOD THING IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS IN IT IT WOULD PAY TO LOOK INTO IT
3607-29116-0018 THE SENATOR LAUGHED BUT RATHER FEEBLY AND SAID BALLOON IS ALWAYS FULL OF HIS JOKES I EXPLAINED IT TO HIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT HE ONLY WANTED A WORD WITH YOU CONTINUED LAURA HE IS A HANDSOME OLD GENTLEMAN AND HE IS GALLANT FOR AN OLD MAN

3607-29116-0020 BUT HE IS RIGHT AT HEART HIS TERM EXPIRES NEXT YEAR AND I FEAR WE SHALL LOSE HIM HE SEEMED TO BE PACKING THE DAY I WAS THERE HIS ROOMS WERE FULL OF DRY GOODS BOXES INTO WHICH HIS SERVANT WAS CROWDING ALL MANNER OF OLD CLOTHES AND STUFF
3607-29116-0021 I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES
3607-29116-0022 IT'S A FUNNY WORLD GOOD BYE UNCLE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS MARKING DASHING
3607-29116-0023 ERASING FIGURING AND TALKING TO HERSELF FREE I WONDER WHAT DILWORTHY DOES THINK OF ME ANYWAY ONE TWO EIGHT SEVENTEEN
3607-29116-0024 WOULDN'T DILWORTHY OPEN HIS EYES IF HE KNEW SOME OF THE THINGS BALLOON DID SAY TO ME THERE HOPPERSON'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO COUNT TWENTY THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD CURMUDGEON SON IN LAW SINECURE IN THE NEGRO INSTITUTION THAT ABOUT GAUGES HIM THE THREE COMMITTEEMEN
3607-29116-0025 SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
3607-29116-0026 UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M EIGHTY FIVE THERE I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN QUEER BUCKSTONE ACTS
3607-29116-0027 SEEMED TO BE IN LOVE I WAS SURE OF IT HE PROMISED TO COME HERE AND HE HASN'T STRANGE VERY STRANGE I MUST CHANCE TO MEET HIM TO DAY LAURA DRESSED AND WENT OUT THINKING SHE WAS PERHAPS TOO EARLY FOR MISTER BUCKSTONE TO COME FROM THE HOUSE
3607-29116-0028 BUT AS HE LODGED NEAR THE BOOKSTORE SHE WOULD DROP IN THERE AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR HIM WHILE LAURA IS ON HER ERRAND TO FIND MISTER BUCKSTONE IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TO REMARK THAT SHE KNEW QUITE AS MUCH OF WASHINGTON LIFE AS SENATOR DILWORTHY GAVE HER CREDIT FOR
3607-29116-0029 AND MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO TELL HIM SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY THIS TIME WITH A GOOD MANY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS OF NEWSPAPER ROW AND EXCHANGED GOSSIP WITH THEM TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
3607-29116-0030 THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING IN THE ROW EVERLASTINGLY GOSSIPING BANTERING AND SARCASTICALLY PRAISING THINGS AND GOING ON IN A STYLE WHICH WAS A CURIOUS COMMINGLING OF EARNEST AND PERSIFLAGE COLONEL SELLERS LIKED THIS TALK AMAZINGLY THOUGH HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE AT SEA IN IT
3607-29116-0031 AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T LESSEN THE RELISH OF THE CONVERSATION TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THE DRY GOODS BOX PACKING STORY ABOUT BALLOON ONE DAY AND WERE TALKING IT OVER WHEN THE COLONEL CAME IN THE COLONEL WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND HICKS TOLD HIM
3607-29116-0032 AND THEN HICKS WENT ON WITH A SERIOUS AIR COLONEL IF YOU REGISTER A LETTER IT MEANS THAT IT IS OF VALUE DOESN'T IT AND IF YOU PAY FIFTEEN CENTS FOR REGISTERING IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE EXTRA CARE OF IT AND EVEN PAY YOU BACK ITS FULL VALUE IF IT IS LOST ISN'T THAT SO
3607-29116-0033 YES I SUPPOSE IT'S SO WELL SENATOR BALLOON PUT FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF STAMPS ON EACH OF THOSE SEVEN HUGE BOXES OF OLD CLOTHES AND SHIPPED THAT TON OF SECOND HAND RUBBISH OLD BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AND WHAT NOT THROUGH THE MAILS AS REGISTERED MATTER
3607-29116-0034 IT WAS AN INGENIOUS THING AND IT HAD A GENUINE TOUCH OF HUMOR ABOUT IT TOO I THINK THERE IS MORE REAL TALENT AMONG OUR PUBLIC MEN OF TO DAY THAN THERE WAS AMONG THOSE OF OLD TIMES A FAR MORE FERTILE FANCY A MUCH HAPPIER INGENUITY
3607-29116-0035 NOW COLONEL CAN YOU PICTURE JEFFERSON OR WASHINGTON OR JOHN ADAMS FRANKING THEIR WARDROBES THROUGH THE MAILS AND ADDING THE FACETIOUS IDEA OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARGO FOR THE SUM OF ONE DOLLAR AND FIVE CENTS STATESMEN WERE DULL CREATURES IN THOSE DAYS
3607-29116-0036 I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
3607-29116-0037 WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
3607-29116-0038 YES AND BALLOON HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLIC EXPERIENCE HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE TERRITORIES A WHILE AND WAS VERY SATISFACTORY INDEED HE WAS HE WAS EX OFFICIO INDIAN AGENT TOO
3607-29116-0039 WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE
3607-29116-0040 THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE
3607-29116-0041 WE HAVE MANY TRULY NOBLE STATESMEN IN OUR COUNTRY'S SERVICE LIKE BALLOON THE SENATE IS FULL OF THEM DON'T YOU THINK SO COLONEL WELL I DUNNO I HONOR MY COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SERVANTS AS MUCH AS ANY ONE CAN I MEET THEM SIR EVERY DAY AND THE MORE I SEE OF THEM
3607-29116-0042 OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE
3607-29116-0043 AND IN MY OPINION THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ENNOBLE THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY AMOUNT OF
3607-29116-0044 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COLONEL SELLERS WELL HESITATED THE COLONEL I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL IT IS VERY WRONG IT IS SHAMEFUL
3607-29116-0045 HEAVEN PROTECT ME FROM SUCH A CHARGE THAT IS WHAT DILWORTHY SAID AND YET WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF SOME OF OUR ABLEST MEN SIR IF THE COUNTRY WERE OPPOSED TO TO BRIBERY IT IS A HARSH TERM I DO NOT LIKE TO USE IT
2836-5355-0000 SETTLING THE LOGS TO HIS APPARENT SATISFACTION TO SPEAK AND ACT LET THERE BE PLAIN TRUTH BETWEEN US AT THIS INTERVIEW IF THERE NEVER HAS BEEN BEFORE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU NAKED TRUTH UNGLOSSED OVER
2836-5355-0001 SHE PURSUED BENDING HER EYES DETERMINATELY UPON HIM IT MUST BE WITH ALL MY HEART RETURNED SIR FRANCIS IT IS YOU WHO HAVE THROWN OUT THE CHALLENGE MIND
2836-5355-0002 WHEN YOU LEFT IN JULY YOU GAVE ME A SACRED PROMISE TO COME BACK IN TIME FOR OUR MARRIAGE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY IN TIME BUT OF COURSE I MEANT TO DO SO WHEN I GAVE THE PROMISE HE INTERRUPTED BUT NO SOONER HAD I SET MY FOOT IN LONDON

2836-5355-0007 HE SHOULD HAVE LESS TROUBLE IN THROWING OFF THE MASK BUT HE WAS AN ILL TEMPERED MAN AND TO HEAR THAT THE LETTER HAD BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THE FALSENESS OF HIS FINE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISES LAID BARE DID NOT IMPROVE HIS TEMPER NOW LADY ISABEL CONTINUED
2836-5355-0008 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN
2836-5355-0009 WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED YOUR LISTENING TO ANY SORT OF REASON HER HEART BEAT A LITTLE QUICKER BUT SHE STILLED IT YOU DEEM THAT IT WAS NOT IN REASON THAT I SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE THE WIFE OF SIR FRANCIS LEVISON HE ROSE AND BEGAN KICKING AT THE LOGS WITH THE HEEL OF HIS BOOT THIS TIME

2836-5355-0046 I WISH YOU A GOOD DAY SO YOU WILL NOT EVEN SHAKE HANDS WITH ME ISABEL I WOULD PREFER NOT AND THUS THEY PARTED SIR FRANCIS LEFT THE ROOM BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY THE HOUSE HE WENT INTO A DISTANT APARTMENT
2836-5355-0047 AND CALLING THE SERVANTS BEFORE HIM THERE WERE BUT TWO GAVE THEM EACH A YEAR'S WAGES IN ADVANCE
2836-5355-0048 THEN HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LANDLORD AND HANDED HIM LIKEWISE A YEAR'S RENT IN ADVANCE MAKING THE SAME REMARK AFTER THAT HE ORDERED DINNER AT A HOTEL AND THE SAME NIGHT HE AND PIERRE DEPARTED ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME AGAIN
2836-5355-0049 SIR FRANCIS THANKING HIS LUCKY STAR THAT HE HAD SO EASILY GOT RID OF A VEXATIOUS ANNOYANCE AND LADY ISABEL SHE PASSED HER EVENING ALONE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND THE SPARKS
2836-5355-0050 INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHEN LADY ISABEL LAY DOWN TO REST SHE SANK INTO A SOMEWHAT CALMER SLEEP THAN SHE HAD KNOWN OF LATE ALSO INTO A DREAM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BACK AT EAST LYNNE NOT BACK IN ONE SENSE
2836-5355-0051 BUT THAT SHE SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE GONE AWAY FROM IT WALKING IN THE FLOWER GARDEN WITH MISTER CARLYLE WHILE THE THREE CHILDREN PLAYED ON THE LAWN HER ARM WAS WITHIN HER HUSBAND'S AND HE WAS RELATING SOMETHING TO HER WHAT THE NEWS WAS SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER AFTERWARD
2836-5355-0052 EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
2836-5355-0053 ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
8770-295463-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN THE GLORY OF GETTYSBURG THE BATTLE
8770-295463-0001 IF LEE HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS THERE HE MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK BY SUCH A BRILLIANT STROKE HE COULD HAVE SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED BALTIMORE AND WASHINGTON THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE GRAND RESULT OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0002 IN POINT OF NUMBERS BRAVERY AND GENIUS THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WAS THE GREATEST THAT HAD EVER BEEN FOUGHT UP TO THAT TIME GLORIOUS AS THIS WAS
8770-295463-0003 THE GREATEST GLORY OF GETTYSBURG LAY IN THE EXPERIENCES AND UTTERANCES OF ONE MAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IT CAME AT A TERRIBLE TIME IN THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0004 ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE
8770-295463-0005 BUT HE SOON WON THE GREAT BATTLES OF FREDERICKSBURG AND CHANCELLORSVILLE AND HAD MADE HIS WAY NORTH INTO PENNSYLVANIA THE NIGHT AFTER THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE
8770-295463-0006 WAS THE DARKEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR PRESIDENT LINCOLN WALKED THE FLOOR THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG CRYING OUT IN HIS ANGUISH O WHAT WILL THE COUNTRY SAY
8770-295463-0007 AFTER WINNING THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WHICH THE PRESIDENT HOPED WOULD END THE WAR GENERAL MEADE INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY STATED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN THE INVADERS FROM OUR SOIL
8770-295463-0008 BELIEVING HE WAS ON GOD'S SIDE HE FELT THAT THE CAUSE OF RIGHT COULD NOT LOSE FOR THE LORD WOULD SAVE HIS OWN THE NEXT DAY JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE CAME THE SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG
8770-295463-0009 THE STRONGHOLD OF THE GREAT WEST
8770-295463-0010 CALLING ON GENERAL SICKLES IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR THE GENERAL HAD LOST A LEG ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHY HE BELIEVED THAT VICTORY WOULD BE GIVEN THE FEDERAL FORCES AT GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0011 I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS IN THE PINCH OF YOUR CAMPAIGN UP THERE WHEN EVERYBODY SEEMED PANIC STRICKEN
8770-295463-0012 THAT IF HE WOULD STAND BY OUR BOYS AT GETTYSBURG I WOULD STAND BY HIM AND HE DID AND I WILL THE PRESIDENT'S CALL ON GENERAL SICKLES WAS ON THE SUNDAY AFTER THE THREE DAYS BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0013 BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE GUNBOAT AT CAIRO ILLINOIS WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS FROM VICKSBURG WHICH ADDED NEW LUSTER TO THE PATRIOTIC JOY OF INDEPENDENCE DAY THE TELEGRAPH WIRES
8770-295463-0014 HAD BEEN SO GENERALLY CUT ON ALL SIDES OF VICKSBURG THAT THE NEWS WAS SENT TO CAIRO AND TELEGRAPHED TO WASHINGTON IN PROOF THAT HIS FAITH EVEN INCLUDED THE MISSISSIPPI BLOCKADE HE WENT ON BESIDES
8770-295463-0015 I HAVE BEEN PRAYING OVER VICKSBURG ALSO AND BELIEVE OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS GOING TO GIVE US VICTORY THERE TOO BECAUSE WE NEED IT IN ORDER TO BISECT THE CONFEDERACY
8770-295463-0016 PROMINENT IN NATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS AND THE GREATEST LIVING ORATOR WAS INVITED TO DELIVER THE GRAND ORATION THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE COULD TO COME AND MAKE A FEW DEDICATORY REMARKS
8770-295463-0017 BUT MISTER EVERETT WAS TO BE THE CHIEF SPEAKER OF THE OCCASION THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE DATE OF THE DEDICATION THE PRESIDENT WENT WITH HIS FRIEND NOAH BROOKS
8770-295463-0018 TO GARDNER'S GALLERY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE HAD PROMISED TO SIT FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPH WHILE THERE HE SHOWED MISTER BROOKS A PROOF OF EVERETT'S ORATION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM AS THIS PRINTED ADDRESS COVERED TWO NEWSPAPER PAGES
8770-295463-0019 WHEN MISTER BROOKS ASKED ABOUT HIS SPEECH FOR THAT OCCASION MISTER LINCOLN REPLIED I'VE GOT IT WRITTEN BUT NOT LICKED INTO SHAPE YET IT'S SHORT SHORT SHORT
8770-295463-0020 DURING THE FORENOON OF THE EIGHTEENTH SECRETARY JOHN HAY WAS ANXIOUS LEST THE PRESIDENT BE LATE FOR THE SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL TRAIN WHICH WAS TO LEAVE AT NOON FOR GETTYSBURG DON'T WORRY JOHN SAID MISTER LINCOLN
8770-295463-0021 DON'T HURRY BOYS THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING GOING ON TILL I GET THERE WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED ON THE WAY TO GETTYSBURG A LITTLE GIRL ON THE PLATFORM HELD UP A BOUQUET TO MISTER LINCOLN LISPING FLOWERTH FOR THE PRETHIDENT
8770-295463-0022 HE REACHED OUT TOOK HER UP AND KISSED HER SAYING YOU'RE A SWEET LITTLE ROSEBUD YOURSELF I HOPE YOUR LIFE WILL OPEN INTO PERPETUAL BEAUTY AND GOODNESS
8770-295463-0023 ABOUT NOON ON THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER THE DISTINGUISHED PARTY ARRIVED IN A PROCESSION AND TOOK SEATS ON THE PLATFORM ERECTED FOR THE EXERCISES THE PRESIDENT WAS SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR PLACED THERE FOR HIM
8770-295463-0024 THERE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING
8770-295463-0025 WATCHING HER WHILE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS FANNING HER TENDERLY THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SHE GASPED I FEEL BETTER NOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY HUSBAND
8770-295463-0026 THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING WAS SUFFICIENT NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE APPLAUDED ABRAHAM LINCOLN IF HE HAD MERELY RECITED THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
8770-295463-0027 WHICH THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO ATTEND TAKING SECRETARY SEWARD WITH HIM HE CALLED ON AN OLD COBBLER NAMED JOHN BURNS OF WHOSE COURAGE IN THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG MISTER LINCOLN HAD JUST HEARD
8770-295465-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN PATRIOT THERE WAS NO MORE STURDY LITTLE PATRIOT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAN LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN THE CHILD OF THE NATION
8770-295465-0001 NOR HAD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A MORE DEVOTED ADMIRER AND FOLLOWER THAN HIS OWN SMALL SON A WORD FROM HIS FATHER WOULD MELT THE LAD TO TEARS AND SUBMISSION OR BRING HIM OUT OF A NERVOUS TANTRUM WITH HIS
8770-295465-0002 WREATHED WITH SMILES AND A CHUCKLING IN HIS THROAT OF PAPA DAY MY PAPA DAY NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE BOY MEANT BY PAPA DAY IT WAS HIS PET NAME FOR THE DEAREST MAN ON EARTH
8770-295465-0003 AND IT WAS HIS ONLY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GREATEST PLEASURE HIS BOYISH HEART WAS ABLE TO HOLD IT WAS THE SWEETEST WORD EVER HEARD BY THE WAR BURDENED CRUSHED AND SORROWING SOUL OF THE BROKEN HEARTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295465-0004 MISTER LINCOLN TOOK HIS YOUNGEST SON WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS GREAT MISSION TO FORTRESS MONROE AND THEY THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT THE SOLDIERS SAID MARCHED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE STREETS OF FALLEN RICHMOND
8770-295465-0005 BECAME PERFECTLY RIGHT AND PROPER WHEN CERTAIN UNKNOWN FACTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WAVING THE STARS AND BARS OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW FOR INSTANCE ONE NIGHT
8770-295465-0006 IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
8770-295465-0007 BUT THAT HIS HEART WENT OUT ALSO TO THE BOYS IN GRAY THE SOLDIERS WERE ALL BOYS TO HIM THEY KNEW HE LOVED THEM THEY SAID AMONG THEMSELVES HE CARES FOR US HE TAKES OUR PART
8770-295465-0008 WE WILL FIGHT FOR HIM YES WE WILL DIE FOR HIM AND A LARGE PART OF THE COMMON SOLDIER'S PATRIOTISM WAS THIS HEART RESPONSE OF THE BOYS TO THE GREAT BOY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295465-0009 FOR THE YOUNGER SOLDIERS THE REAL BOYS OF THE ARMY GOING ALWAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIS PAPA DAY SAY OF SEVERAL YOUTHS CONDEMNED TO BE SHOT FOR SLEEPING AT THEIR POST OR SOME LIKE OFFENSE
8770-295465-0010 THAT BOY IS WORTH MORE ABOVE GROUND THAN UNDER OR A LIVE BOY CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY BETTER THAN A DEAD ONE GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S MOTTO
8770-295465-0011 AND HE WANTED ALL OTHER BOYS TO HAVE A FAIR SHOW HIS OWN FATHER HAD BEEN TOO HARD WITH HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO ALL THE OTHER BOYS HE COULD REACH THIS PASSION FOR DOING GOOD TO OTHERS
8770-295465-0012 BEGAN IN THE LOG CABIN WHEN HE HAD NO IDEA HE COULD EVER BE EXERCISING HIS LOVING KINDNESS IN THE EXECUTIVE MANSION THE HOME OF THE NATION WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL WAS THE RULE OF HIS LIFE
8770-295465-0013 IN THE BACKWOODS AS WELL AS IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND THE BOYS IN GRAY WERE HIS BOYS TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO THEY HAD WANDERED AWAY THEY WERE A LITTLE WAYWARD BUT HE WOULD WIN THEM BACK
8770-295465-0014 THE GREAT CHIVALROUS SOUTH HAS LEARNED SINCE THOSE BITTER RUINOUS DAYS THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS THE BEST FRIEND THE SOUTH THEN HAD IN THE NORTH TAD HAD SEEN HIS FATHER SHOW GREAT TENDERNESS TO ALL THE BOYS
8770-295465-0015 HE MET IN THE GRAY UNIFORM BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW HIS TENDERNESS TO THE SOUTH THOUGH THERE WAS A SECRET PIGEONHOLE IN HIS DESK STUFFED FULL OF THREATS OF ASSASSINATION HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF DEATH
8770-295465-0016 AND THE COUNTRY ANY GOOD BUT IT HURT HIM DEEP IN HIS HEART TO KNOW THAT SOME OF HIS BELOVED CHILDREN MISUNDERSTOOD HIM SO THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO KILL HIM IT WAS NO ONE'S BULLET WHICH MADE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A MARTYR
8770-295465-0017 ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD SHOWN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE WHICH WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS VERY LIFE IF IT COULD SAVE OR HELP OTHERS ALL THESE THINGS LITTLE TAD COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED
8770-295465-0018 BUT THEY WERE INBRED INTO THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG FATHER AND THE SMALL SON WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOYS TOGETHER
8770-295465-0019 MISTER LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN A SHORT ADDRESS FOR THE OCCASION THE TIMES WERE SO OUT OF JOINT AND EVERY WORD WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK OFF HAND A FRIEND STEPPED OUT ON THE NORTHERN PORTICO WITH HIM
8770-295465-0020 TO HOLD THE CANDLE BY WHICH MISTER LINCOLN WAS TO READ HIS SPEECH LITTLE TAD WAS WITH HIS FATHER AS USUAL AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAD FINISHED READING A PAGE OF HIS MANUSCRIPT HE LET IT FLUTTER DOWN LIKE A LEAF OR A BIG WHITE BUTTERFLY
8770-295465-0021 FOR TAD TO CATCH WHEN THE PAGES CAME TOO SLOWLY THE BOY PULLED HIS FATHER'S COAT TAIL PIPING UP IN A MUFFLED EXCITED TONE GIVE ME NOTHER PAPER PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0022 IT SEEMED RIDICULOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ALLOW ANY CHILD TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT AND HAMPER HIM WHILE DELIVERING A GREAT ADDRESS WHICH WOULD WIELD A NATIONAL IF NOT WORLD WIDE INFLUENCE
8770-295465-0023 WE MEET THIS EVENING NOT IN SORROW BUT GLADNESS OF HEART THE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG AND RICHMOND AND THE SURRENDER OF THE PRINCIPAL INSURGENT ARMY AT APPOMATTOX GIVE HOPE OF A RIGHTEOUS AND SPEEDY PEACE
8770-295465-0024 AND WILL BE DULY PROMULGATED GIVE US DIXIE BOYS THEN HE WENT ON OUTLINING A POLICY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TOWARD THE SOUTH SHOWING A SPIRIT FAR HIGHER
8770-295465-0025 AND MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT OF THE LISTENING CROWD ON CONCLUDING HIS ADDRESS AND BIDDING THE ASSEMBLED MULTITUDE GOOD NIGHT HE TURNED TO THE SERENADING BAND AND SHOUTED JOYOUSLY GIVE US DIXIE BOYS PLAY DIXIE
8770-295465-0026 WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT TUNE NOW THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GASPED AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN THEY SAW TAD WAVING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AT THE WINDOW
8770-295465-0027 AS MISTER LINCOLN CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR AFTER SPEAKING TO THE CROWD MISSUS LINCOLN WHO HAD BEEN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS LOOKING ON FROM WITHIN EXCLAIMED TO HIM YOU MUST NOT BE SO CARELESS
8770-295465-0028 SOME ONE COULD EASILY HAVE SHOT YOU WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING THERE AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE THREATENING YOUR LIFE THE PRESIDENT SMILED AT HIS WIFE THROUGH A LOOK OF INEXPRESSIBLE PAIN AND SADNESS AND SHRUGGED HIS GREAT SHOULDERS
8770-295465-0029 BUT STILL HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO BOYS AT A LATE HOUR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT THAT SAME WEEK LITTLE TAD CAME IN ALONE AT A BASEMENT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NATIONAL THEATER
8770-295465-0030 AND SOME OF THE COMPANY HAD MADE A GREAT PET OF HIM
8770-295465-0031 LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL SEEING THOMAS PENDEL THE FAITHFUL DOORKEEPER HE WAILED FROM HIS BREAKING HEART TOM PEN TOM PEN THEY HAVE KILLED PAPA DAY THEY HAVE KILLED MY PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0032 AND NOW HIS MOTHER WAS DESPERATELY ILL AND HIS FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED TAD OF COURSE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY ANY ONE COULD BE SO CRUEL AND WICKED AS TO WISH TO MURDER HIS DARLING PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0033 WHO LOVED EVERY ONE SO HE WANDERED THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS ACHING WITH LONELINESS MURMURING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF PAPA DAY WHERE'S MY PAPA DAY I'M TIRED
8770-295465-0034 TIRED OF PLAYING ALONE I WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER PLEASE PAPA DAY COME BACK AND PLAY WITH YOUR LITTLE TAD YOUNG THOUGH HE WAS HE COULD NOT SLEEP LONG AT NIGHT
8770-295465-0035 HIS SENSE OF LONELINESS PENETRATED HIS DREAMS SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHUCKLE AND GURGLE IN AN ECSTACY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN RIDING ON HIS FATHER'S BACK ROMPING THROUGH THE STATELY ROOMS
8770-295465-0036 TAD OPENED HIS EYES WIDE WITH WONDER IS PAPA DAY HAPPY IN HEAVEN HE ASKED EAGERLY YES YES I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY THERE TADDIE DEAR NOW GO TO SLEEP
8770-295465-0037 PAPA DAY'S HAPPY I'M GLAD SO GLAD SIGHED THE LITTLE BOY FOR PAPA DAY NEVER WAS HAPPY HERE THEN HE FELL INTO HIS FIRST SWEET SLEEP SINCE THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT
8770-295465-0038 GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE THE FOND HEARTED LITTLE FELLOW WENT ABROAD WITH HIS MOTHER A FEW YEARS AFTER THE TRAGEDY THAT BROKE BOTH THEIR LIVES BY A SURGICAL OPERATION AND BY STRUGGLING MANFULLY
8770-295465-0039 HE HAD CORRECTED THE IMPERFECTION IN HIS SPEECH BUT THE HEART OF LITTLE TAD HAD BEEN BROKEN WHILE STILL A LAD HE JOINED HIS FOND FATHER IN THE BEYOND GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE HAD AMOUNTED TO A PASSION WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8770-295465-0040 FOR THIS AS FOR ALL THE INEQUITIES THE GREAT HEART OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PREPARED HIS SPIRIT HAD SHONE THROUGH HIS WHOLE LIFE AS IF IN LETTERS OF LIVING FIRE WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
8063-274117-0000 LIKE A KIND GOOD HOUSEKEEPER IT WAS STILL PERFECTLY DARK THEN
8063-274117-0001 HE TOOK BY ASSAULT PORTHOS'S ROOM WHICH WAS NEXT TO HIS OWN THE WORTHY PORTHOS WAS SLEEPING WITH A NOISE LIKE DISTANT THUNDER IN THE DIM OBSCURITY OF THE ROOM HIS GIGANTIC FRAME WAS PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED
8063-274117-0002 AND HIS SWOLLEN FIST HUNG DOWN OUTSIDE THE BED UPON THE CARPET

8063-274115-0018 WHEN THE THREE RIDERS WHO HAD LEFT PARIS ABOUT SIX IN THE EVENING ARRIVED AT FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274115-0019 AND SEEMED DELIGHTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS MEADOWS HIS WOODS AND HIS RABBIT WARRENS PORTHOS HAD ALL THE TASTE AND PRIDE OF A LANDED PROPRIETOR WHEN D'ARTAGNAN SAW HIS TWO COMPANIONS IN EARNEST CONVERSATION
8063-274115-0020 SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE WHOLE WORLD AS HE HAD DONE FROM PORTHOS AND FROM PLANCHET THE MOON SHONE SOFTLY THROUGH THE FOLIAGE OF THE FOREST THE BREEZES OF THE OPEN COUNTRY ROSE DELICIOUSLY PERFUMED TO THE HORSE'S NOSTRILS AND THEY SNORTED AND PRANCED ALONG DELIGHTEDLY
8063-274115-0021 IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS WHERE THE GRASS GREW AS HIGH AS THE KNEES AND WHERE HE HAD PLAYED UNDER THE GREEN APPLE TREES COVERED WITH RED CHEEKED FRUIT HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE HAD SOLEMNLY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIS FORTUNE HE WOULD RETURN TO NATURE
8063-274115-0022 HOW SO WHY YOU SEEM TO BE IN THE WAY OF MAKING YOUR FORTUNE VERY SOON
8063-274115-0023 WHAT IS IT INQUIRED PORTHOS LOOKING ALL ROUND HIM AS IF IN SEARCH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ANNOYED PLANCHET AND DESIROUS OF FREEING HIM FROM IT WHY FORMERLY SAID THE GROCER YOU USED TO CALL ME PLANCHET QUITE SHORT
8063-274115-0024 AND YOU WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO ME THEN IN A MUCH MORE FAMILIAR MANNER THAN YOU DO NOW CERTAINLY CERTAINLY I SHOULD HAVE SAID SO FORMERLY REPLIED THE GOOD NATURED PORTHOS WITH AN EMBARRASSMENT FULL OF DELICACY BUT FORMERLY
8063-274115-0025 SO THAT MONSIEUR LE BARON CONTINUED THE GROCER
8063-274115-0026 IF THAT BE THE CASE MY DEAR PLANCHET I WILL DO SO CERTAINLY REPLIED PORTHOS AND
8063-274115-0027 BUT A FORTUNATE MOVEMENT OF THE HORSE MADE HIM MISS HIS AIM
8063-274115-0028 WHICH MADE THE ANIMAL'S LEGS ALMOST GIVE WAY D'ARTAGNAN BURST OUT LAUGHING AS HE SAID TAKE CARE PLANCHET
8063-274115-0029 OH SAID PLANCHET MOUSQUETON IS NOT DEAD AND YET MONSIEUR LE BARON IS VERY FOND OF HIM

8063-274115-0033 IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CAN WALK ABOUT THE KING'S FOREST WHICH IS VERY BEAUTIFUL
8063-274115-0034 NEARLY AS BEAUTIFUL AS MY FOREST AT BERRY PLANCHET OPENED HIS EYES VERY WIDE
8063-274115-0035 BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT ENDS AND ALSO BECAUSE IT IS FULL OF POACHERS HOW CAN THE POACHERS MAKE THE FOREST SO AGREEABLE TO YOU BECAUSE THEY HUNT MY GAME AND I HUNT THEM
8063-274115-0036 WHICH IN THESE PEACEFUL TIMES IS FOR ME A SUFFICIENTLY PLEASING PICTURE OF WAR ON A SMALL SCALE
6925-80680-0000 ONE HOT NIGHT IN HINDUSTAN A KING AND QUEEN LAY AWAKE IN THE PALACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY EVERY NOW AND THEN A FAINT AIR BLEW THROUGH THE LATTICE AND THEY HOPED THEY WERE GOING TO SLEEP BUT THEY NEVER DID PRESENTLY THEY BECAME MORE BROAD AWAKE THAN EVER
6925-80680-0001 AT THE SOUND OF A HOWL OUTSIDE THE PALACE LISTEN TO THAT TIGER REMARKED THE KING TIGER REPLIED THE QUEEN HOW SHOULD THERE BE A TIGER INSIDE THE CITY IT WAS ONLY A JACKAL I TELL YOU IT WAS A TIGER SAID THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE DREAMING
6925-80680-0002 IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A JACKAL ANSWERED THE QUEEN I SAY IT WAS A TIGER CRIED THE KING DON'T CONTRADICT ME NONSENSE SNAPPED THE QUEEN IT WAS A JACKAL AND THE DISPUTE WAXED SO WARM THAT THE KING SAID AT LAST VERY WELL
6925-80680-0003 WE'LL CALL THE GUARD AND ASK AND IF IT WAS A JACKAL I'LL LEAVE THIS KINGDOM TO YOU AND GO AWAY AND IF IT WAS A TIGER THEN YOU SHALL GO AND I WILL MARRY A NEW WIFE AS YOU LIKE ANSWERED THE QUEEN THERE ISN'T ANY DOUBT WHICH IT WAS
6925-80680-0004 SO THE KING CALLED THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE ON GUARD OUTSIDE AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM BUT WHILST THE DISPUTE WAS GOING ON THE KING AND QUEEN HAD GOT SO EXCITED AND TALKED SO LOUD THAT THE GUARDS HAD HEARD NEARLY ALL THEY SAID AND ONE MAN OBSERVED TO THE OTHER
6925-80680-0005 MIND YOU DECLARE THAT THE KING IS RIGHT IT CERTAINLY WAS A JACKAL BUT IF WE SAY SO THE KING WILL PROBABLY NOT KEEP HIS WORD ABOUT GOING AWAY AND WE SHALL GET INTO TROUBLE SO WE HAD BETTER TAKE HIS SIDE TO THIS THE OTHER AGREED
6925-80680-0006 THE KING MADE NO REMARK BUT SENT FOR A PALANQUIN AND ORDERED THE QUEEN TO BE PLACED IN IT BIDDING THE FOUR BEARERS OF THE PALANQUIN TO TAKE HER A LONG WAY OFF INTO THE FOREST AND THERE LEAVE HER IN SPITE OF HER TEARS SHE WAS FORCED TO OBEY
6925-80680-0007 AND AWAY THE BEARERS WENT FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS UNTIL THEY CAME TO A DENSE WOOD
6925-80680-0008 AND STARTED HOME AGAIN NOW THE QUEEN THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT THE KING COULD NOT MEAN TO SEND HER AWAY FOR GOOD AND THAT AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT OVER HIS FIT OF TEMPER HE WOULD SUMMON HER BACK SO SHE STAYED QUITE STILL FOR A LONG TIME LISTENING WITH ALL HER EARS FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
6925-80680-0009 BUT HEARD NONE AFTER A WHILE SHE GREW NERVOUS FOR SHE WAS ALL ALONE AND PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE PALANQUIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HER DAY WAS JUST BREAKING AND BIRDS AND INSECTS WERE BEGINNING TO STIR
6925-80680-0010 BUT ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN'S EYES WANDERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY HUMAN BEING THEN HER SPIRIT GAVE WAY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY IT SO HAPPENED THAT CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE QUEEN'S PALANQUIN HAD BEEN SET DOWN THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD A TINY FARM IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0011 WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED ALONE FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS AS IT WAS HOT WEATHER THE FARMER HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON THE FLAT ROOF OF HIS HOUSE BUT WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF WEEPING HE JUMPED UP AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS FAST AS HE COULD AND INTO THE FOREST TOWARDS THE PLACE THE SOUND CAME FROM
6925-80680-0012 AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY THE FARMER CALLED HIS WIFE WHO LED HER TO THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE HER FOOD TO EAT AND A BED TO LIE ON AND IN THE FARM A FEW DAYS LATER A LITTLE PRINCE WAS BORN AND BY HIS MOTHER'S WISH NAMED AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0013 YEARS PASSED WITHOUT A SIGN FROM THE KING HIS WIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR ALL HE SEEMED TO CARE THOUGH THE QUEEN STILL LIVED WITH THE FARMER AND THE LITTLE PRINCE HAD BY THIS TIME GROWN UP INTO A STRONG HANDSOME AND HEALTHY YOUTH OUT IN THE FOREST THEY SEEMED FAR FROM THE WORLD
6925-80680-0014 VERY FEW EVER CAME NEAR THEM AND THE PRINCE WAS CONTINUALLY BEGGING HIS MOTHER AND THE FARMER TO BE ALLOWED TO GO AWAY AND SEEK ADVENTURES AND TO MAKE HIS OWN LIVING BUT SHE AND THE WISE FARMER ALWAYS COUNSELLED HIM TO WAIT UNTIL
6925-80680-0015 AT LAST WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE THEY HAD NOT THE HEART TO FORBID HIM ANY LONGER
6925-80680-0016 A BIG BRASS POT TO HOLD WATER A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
6925-80680-0017 MANY A WEARY MILE HE TRAMPED DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL ONE MORNING HE SAW BEFORE HIM JUST SUCH A FOREST AS THAT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED AND HE STEPPED JOYFULLY INTO IT LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO MEET AN OLD FRIEND
6925-80680-0018 PRESENTLY AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH A THICKET HE SAW A PIGEON WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD MAKE A GOOD DINNER SO HE FIRED A PELLET AT IT FROM HIS GALAIL BUT MISSED THE PIGEON WHICH FLUTTERED AWAY WITH A STARTLED CLATTER AT THE SAME INSTANT HE HEARD A GREAT CLAMOUR FROM BEYOND THE THICKET
6925-80680-0019 AND ON REACHING THE SPOT HE FOUND AN UGLY OLD WOMAN STREAMING WET AND CRYING LOUDLY AS SHE LIFTED FROM HER HEAD
6925-80680-0020 THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE BRIGHTENED SHE SHOWED HIM WHERE TO SEEK THE WATER AND WHEN HE RETURNED A FEW MINUTES LATER WITH HIS POT FILLED TO THE BRIM SHE LED THE WAY WITHOUT A WORD AND HE FOLLOWED IN A SHORT WHILE THEY CAME TO A HUT IN THE FOREST
6925-80680-0021 AND AS THEY DREW NEAR IT AMEER ALI BEHELD IN THE DOORWAY THE LOVELIEST DAMSEL HIS EYES HAD EVER LOOKED ON AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER SHE DREW HER VEIL ABOUT HER AND STEPPED INTO THE HUT AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN
6925-80680-0022 AMEER ALI COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE BY WHICH TO BRING HER BACK AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART HE MADE HIS SALUTATION AND BADE THE OLD WOMAN FAREWELL BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY SHE CALLED AFTER HIM IF EVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE OR DANGER
6925-80680-0023 COME TO WHERE YOU NOW STAND AND CRY FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOU THE PRINCE THANKED HER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE OLD WOMAN'S SAYING AND MUCH OF THE LOVELY DAMSEL
6925-80680-0024 SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE ARRIVED AT A CITY AND AS HE WAS NOW IN GREAT STRAITS
6925-80680-0025 THE KING SAID HE HAD PLENTY OF SERVANTS AND WANTED NO MORE
6925-80680-0026 AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD ENTER HIS BODYGUARD ON THE CONDITION THAT HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SERVICE WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT OR DANGEROUS THIS WAS JUST WHAT AMEER ALI WANTED AND HE AGREED TO DO WHATEVER THE KING MIGHT WISH
6925-80680-0027 SOON AFTER THIS ON A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT WHEN THE RIVER ROARED BENEATH THE PALACE WALLS THE SOUND OF A WOMAN WEEPING AND WAILING WAS HEARD ABOVE THE STORM THE KING ORDERED A SERVANT TO GO AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT THE SERVANT FALLING ON HIS KNEES IN TERROR
6925-80680-0028 BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SENT ON SUCH AN ERRAND PARTICULARLY ON A NIGHT SO WILD WHEN EVIL SPIRITS AND WITCHES WERE SURE TO BE ABROAD INDEED SO FRIGHTENED WAS HE THAT THE KING WHO WAS VERY KIND HEARTED BADE ANOTHER TO GO IN HIS STEAD
6925-80680-0029 BUT EACH ONE SHOWED THE SAME STRANGE FEAR THEN AMEER ALI STEPPED FORWARD THIS IS MY DUTY YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID I WILL GO THE KING NODDED AND OFF HE WENT THE NIGHT WAS AS DARK AS PITCH
6925-80680-0030 BUT HE MADE HIS WAY DOWN TO THE FORD UNDER THE PALACE WALLS AND STEPPED INTO THE FLOODED WATER INCH BY INCH AND FOOT BY FOOT HE FOUGHT HIS WAY ACROSS NOW NEARLY SWEPT OFF HIS FEET BY SOME SUDDEN SWIRL OR EDDY NOW NARROWLY ESCAPING
6925-80680-0031 BEING CAUGHT IN THE BRANCHES OF SOME FLOATING TREE THAT CAME TOSSING AND SWINGING DOWN THE STREAM AT LENGTH HE EMERGED PANTING AND DRIPPING WET ON THE OTHER SIDE CLOSE BY THE BANK STOOD A GALLOWS AND ON THE GALLOWS HUNG THE BODY OF SOME EVILDOER
6925-80680-0032 WHILST FROM THE FOOT OF IT CAME THE SOUND OF SOBBING THAT THE KING HAD HEARD
6925-80680-0033 OR OF THE ROARING RIVER AS FOR GHOSTS AND WITCHES THEY HAD NEVER TROUBLED HIM SO HE WALKED UP TOWARDS THE GALLOWS WHERE CROUCHED THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN WHAT AILS YOU HE SAID NOW THE WOMAN WAS NOT REALLY A WOMAN AT ALL
6925-80680-0034 BUT A HORRID KIND OF WITCH WHO REALLY LIVED IN WITCHLAND AND HAD NO BUSINESS ON EARTH IF EVER A MAN STRAYED INTO WITCHLAND THE OGRESSES USED TO EAT HIM UP AND THIS OLD WITCH THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO CATCH A MAN FOR SUPPER
6925-80680-0035 IN HOPES THAT SOMEONE OUT OF PITY MIGHT COME TO HER RESCUE SO WHEN AMEER ALI QUESTIONED HER SHE REPLIED AH KIND SIR IT IS MY POOR SON WHO HANGS UPON THAT GALLOWS HELP ME TO GET HIM DOWN AND I WILL BLESS YOU FOR EVER
6925-80680-0036 AMEER ALI THOUGHT THAT HER VOICE SOUNDED RATHER EAGER
6925-80680-0037 AND BENT SO THAT THE OLD WOMAN COULD CLAMBER ON TO HIS BACK WHICH SHE DID VERY NIMBLY THEN SUDDENLY HE FELT A NOOSE SLIPPED OVER HIS NECK
6925-80680-0038 BUT AMEER ALI GAVE A SWEEP UPWARDS WITH HIS SHARP SWORD TO CUT THE ROPE THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED ROUND HIS NECK
6925-80680-0039 AND WITH A YELL OF PAIN AND ANGER SHE VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS AMEER ALI THEN SAT DOWN TO COLLECT HIMSELF A LITTLE AND FELT UPON THE GROUND BY HIS SIDE AN ANKLET THAT HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN OFF THE OLD WITCH'S FOOT
6925-80680-0040 AND AS THE STORM HAD BY THIS TIME PASSED OVER HE MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS STORY HE TOOK THE ANKLET OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE KING WHO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS AMAZED AT THE GLORY OF THE JEWELS WHICH COMPOSED IT INDEED
6925-80680-0041 AMEER ALI HIMSELF WAS ASTONISHED FOR HE HAD SLIPPED THE ANKLET INTO HIS POCKET IN THE DARK AND HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT SINCE THE KING WAS DELIGHTED AT ITS BEAUTY AND HAVING PRAISED AND REWARDED AMEER ALI HE GAVE THE ANKLET TO HIS DAUGHTER A PROUD AND SPOILED PRINCESS
6925-80680-0042 NOW IN THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE PALACE THERE HUNG TWO CAGES IN ONE OF WHICH WAS A PARROT AND IN THE OTHER A STARLING AND THESE TWO BIRDS COULD TALK AS WELL AS HUMAN BEINGS THEY WERE BOTH PETS OF THE PRINCESS WHO ALWAYS FED THEM HERSELF AND THE NEXT DAY AS SHE WAS
6925-80680-0043 WALKING GRANDLY ABOUT WITH HER TREASURE TIED ROUND HER ANKLE SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY TO THE PARROT
6925-80680-0044 THAT WAS THE PARROT'S NAME HOW DO YOU THINK THE PRINCESS LOOKS IN HER NEW JEWEL THINK SNAPPED THE PARROT WHO WAS CROSS BECAUSE THEY HADN'T GIVEN HIM HIS BATH THAT MORNING I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE A WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER WITH ONE SHOE ON AND THE OTHER OFF
6925-80680-0045 WHY DOESN'T SHE WEAR TWO OF THEM INSTEAD OF GOING ABOUT WITH ONE LEG ADORNED AND THE OTHER EMPTY WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THIS SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND SENDING FOR HER FATHER
6925-80680-0046 OR SHE WOULD DIE OF SHAME SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0047 OR HE SHOULD BE HANGED FOR THE PRINCESS WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT POOR AMEER ALI WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE KING'S COMMAND BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AT ANY RATE A MONTH IN WHICH TO LAY HIS PLANS HE LEFT THE PALACE AT ONCE
6925-80680-0048 AND INQUIRED OF EVERYONE WHERE THE FINEST JEWELS WERE TO BE GOT BUT THOUGH HE SOUGHT NIGHT AND DAY HE NEVER FOUND ONE TO COMPARE WITH THE ANKLET AT LAST ONLY A WEEK REMAINED AND HE WAS IN SORE DIFFICULTY WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE FAIRY OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0049 THEREFORE AWAY HE WENT AND AFTER A DAY'S TRAVELLING HE REACHED THE COTTAGE IN THE FOREST AND STANDING WHERE HE HAD STOOD WHEN THE OLD WOMAN CALLED TO HIM HE CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME HELP ME
6925-80680-0050 THEN THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WHOM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE LISTENED LIKE ONE STRUCK DUMB
6925-80680-0051 THEN HE TOLD HER HIS STORY AND SHE WENT WITHIN THE COTTAGE AND CAME BACK WITH TWO WANDS AND A POT OF BOILING WATER THE TWO WANDS SHE PLANTED IN THE GROUND ABOUT SIX FEET APART AND THEN TURNING TO HIM SHE SAID
6925-80680-0052 AND HOLD IT OVER THE CAULDRON AND EVERY DROP OF BLOOD THAT FALLS FROM IT INTO THE WATER WILL BECOME A JEWEL NEXT YOU MUST CHANGE THE WANDS SO THAT THE ONE THAT STOOD AT MY HEAD IS AT MY FEET AND THE ONE AT MY FEET STANDS AT MY HEAD AND PLACE THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IT WILL HEAL
6925-80680-0053 AND I SHALL BECOME QUITE WELL AGAIN AS BEFORE AT FIRST
6925-80680-0054 AT LENGTH SHE PERSUADED HIM TO DO HER BIDDING HE NEARLY FAINTED HIMSELF WITH HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT AFTER THE CRUEL BLOW WHICH LOPPED HER FOOT OFF SHE LAY AS ONE LIFELESS BUT HE HELD THE SEVERED FOOT OVER THE CAULDRON AND AS DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM IT
6925-80680-0055 AND HE SAW EACH TURN IN THE WATER INTO SHINING GEMS HIS HEART TOOK COURAGE VERY SOON THERE WERE PLENTY OF JEWELS IN THE CAULDRON AND HE QUICKLY CHANGED THE WANDS PLACED THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IMMEDIATELY THE TWO PARTS BECAME ONE AS BEFORE
6925-80680-0056 THEN THE MAIDEN OPENED HER EYES SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DRAWING HER VEIL ABOUT HER RAN INTO THE HUT AND WOULD NOT COME OUT OR SPEAK TO HIM ANY MORE
6925-80680-0057 BUT THREE RARE AND BEAUTIFUL ANKLETS AND THESE HE DULY PRESENTED TO THE KING ON THE VERY DAY THAT HIS MONTH OF GRACE WAS OVER THE KING EMBRACED HIM WARMLY AND MADE HIM RICH GIFTS AND THE NEXT DAY THE VAIN PRINCESS PUT TWO ANKLETS ON EACH FOOT
6925-80680-0058 AND STRUTTED UP AND DOWN IN THEM ADMIRING HERSELF IN THE MIRRORS THAT LINED HER ROOM
6925-80680-0059 AND NEVER RECOVERED HIS TEMPER UNTIL AFTER LUNCH SHE'S GOT ALL HER BEAUTY AT ONE END OF HER NOW IF SHE HAD A FEW OF THOSE FINE GEW GAWS ROUND HER NECK AND WRISTS SHE WOULD LOOK BETTER BUT NOW TO MY MIND
6925-80680-0060 SHE LOOKS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THE WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER DRESSED UP POOR PRINCESS SHE WEPT AND STORMED AND RAVED UNTIL SHE MADE HERSELF QUITE ILL
6925-80680-0061 AND THEN SHE DECLARED TO HER FATHER THAT UNLESS SHE HAD BRACELETS AND NECKLACE TO MATCH THE ANKLETS SHE WOULD DIE AGAIN THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND ORDERED HIM TO GET A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS TO MATCH THOSE ANKLETS WITHIN A MONTH OR BE PUT TO A CRUEL DEATH
6925-80680-0062 AND AGAIN AMEER ALI SPENT NEARLY THE WHOLE MONTH SEARCHING FOR THE JEWELS BUT ALL IN VAIN AT LENGTH HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE HUT IN THE FOREST AND STOOD AND CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME
6925-80680-0063 ONCE MORE THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN APPEARED AT HIS SUMMONS AND ASKED WHAT HE WANTED
6925-80680-0064 AND HER HEAD HER WORDS TURNED AMEER ALI PALE WITH HORROR BUT SHE REMINDED HIM THAT NO HARM HAD COME TO HER BEFORE AND AT LAST HE CONSENTED TO DO AS SHE BADE HIM
6925-80680-0065 FROM HER SEVERED HANDS AND HEAD THERE FELL INTO THE CAULDRON BRACELETS AND CHAINS OF RUBIES AND DIAMONDS
6925-80680-0066 THEN THE HEAD AND HANDS WERE JOINED ON TO THE BODY AND LEFT NEITHER SIGN NOR SCAR FULL OF GRATITUDE AMEER ALI TRIED TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND WOULD NOT COME BACK AND HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE HER
6925-80680-0067 WHEN ON THE DAY APPOINTED AMEER ALI PRODUCED A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS EACH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND PRICELESS THAN THE LAST THE KING'S ASTONISHMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH JOY
6925-80680-0068 THE VERY NEXT MORNING SHE PUT ON ALL HER FINERY AND THOUGHT THAT NOW AT LEAST THAT DISAGREEABLE PARROT COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH HER APPEARANCE AND SHE LISTENED EAGERLY WHEN SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY
6925-80680-0069 HOW DO YOU THINK OUR PRINCESS IS LOOKING NOW VERY FINE NO DOUBT GRUMBLED THE PARROT BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF DRESSING UP LIKE THAT FOR ONESELF ONLY SHE OUGHT TO HAVE A HUSBAND WHY DOESN'T SHE MARRY THE MAN WHO GOT HER ALL THESE SPLENDID THINGS
6925-80680-0070 THEN THE PRINCESS SENT FOR HER FATHER AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE WISHED TO MARRY AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0071 SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND TOLD HIM THAT WITHIN A MONTH HE PROPOSED TO DO HIM THE HONOUR OF MARRYING HIM TO THE PRINCESS AND MAKING HIM HEIR TO THE THRONE ON HEARING THIS SPEECH
6925-80680-0072 AMEER ALI BOWED LOW AND ANSWERED THAT HE HAD DONE AND WOULD DO THE KING ALL THE SERVICE THAT LAY IN HIS POWER SAVE ONLY THIS ONE THING THE KING WHO CONSIDERED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND A PRIZE FOR ANY MAN FLEW INTO A PASSION AND THE PRINCESS WAS MORE FURIOUS STILL
6925-80680-0073 AMEER ALI WAS INSTANTLY THROWN INTO THE MOST DISMAL PRISON THAT THEY COULD FIND AND ORDERED TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL THE KING HAD TIME TO THINK IN WHAT WAY HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING DETERMINED THAT THE PRINCESS OUGHT IN ANY CASE TO BE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY
6925-80680-0074 SO HE SENT FORTH HERALDS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES PROCLAIMING THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY ANY PERSON FITTED FOR A BRIDEGROOM AND HEIR TO THE THRONE SHOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE PALACE WHEN THE DAY CAME ALL THE COURT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND A GREAT CROWD ASSEMBLED OF MEN YOUNG AND OLD
6925-80680-0075 WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANYONE ELSE TO GAIN BOTH THE THRONE AND THE PRINCESS AS SOON AS THE KING WAS SEATED HE CALLED UPON AN USHER TO SUMMON THE FIRST CLAIMANT BUT JUST THEN A FARMER WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CROWD CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD A PETITION TO OFFER
6925-80680-0076 WELL HASTEN THEN SAID THE KING I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE FARMER HAS NOW LIVED AND ADMINISTERED JUSTICE LONG IN THIS CITY
6925-80680-0077 WHILST JACKALS HUNT IN EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE PICKED UP
6925-80680-0078 NO YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE FARMER I WOULD ONLY REMIND YOUR MAJESTY THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF JACKALS GATHERED TO DAY TO TRY AND CLAIM YOUR DAUGHTER AND KINGDOM EVERY CITY HAS SENT THEM AND THEY WAIT HUNGRY AND EAGER BUT DO NOT O KING MISTAKE OR PRETEND AGAIN
6925-80680-0079 TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
6925-80680-0080 GROWING PALE AS HE LISTENED IN PRISON REPLIED THE FARMER IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL CLEAR THIS COURT OF THE JACKALS I WILL EXPLAIN CLEAR THE COURT COMMANDED THE KING AND VERY UNWILLINGLY THE VISITORS LEFT THE PALACE NOW
6925-80680-0081 THEN THE FARMER TOLD THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS HOW HE HAD RESCUED THE QUEEN AND BROUGHT UP AMEER ALI AND HE FETCHED THE OLD QUEEN HERSELF WHOM HE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE AT THE SIGHT OF HER THE KING WAS FILLED WITH SHAME AND SELF REPROACH AND WISHED HE COULD HAVE LIVED HIS LIFE OVER AGAIN
6925-80680-0082 AND NOT HAVE MARRIED THE MOTHER OF THE PROUD PRINCESS WHO CAUSED HIM ENDLESS TROUBLE UNTIL HER DEATH MY DAY IS PAST SAID HE AND HE GAVE UP HIS CROWN TO HIS SON AMEER ALI WHO WENT ONCE MORE AND CALLED TO THE FOREST FAIRY TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A QUEEN TO SHARE HIS THRONE
6925-80680-0083 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON I WILL MARRY SAID HE AND THIS TIME THE MAIDEN DID NOT RUN AWAY BUT AGREED TO BE HIS WIFE SO THE TWO WERE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY AND LIVED LONG AND REIGNED HAPPILY AS FOR THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE PITCHER AMEER ALI HAD BROKEN
6925-80680-0084 SHE WAS THE FOREST MAIDEN'S FAIRY GODMOTHER AND WHEN SHE WAS NO LONGER NEEDED TO LOOK AFTER THE GIRL SHE GLADLY RETURNED TO FAIRYLAND THE OLD KING HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD TO CONTRADICT HIS WIFE ANY MORE IF HE EVEN LOOKS AS IF HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH HER
6925-80680-0085 SHE SMILES AT HIM AND SAYS IS IT THE TIGER THEN OR THE JACKAL
1069-133709-0000 HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
1069-133709-0001 PROPERTY ERECTS A KIND OF BARRIER YOU CAN DO A GREAT MANY THINGS IF YOU'RE RICH WHICH WOULD BE SEVERELY CRITICISED IF YOU WERE POOR YOU CAN GO AND COME YOU CAN TRAVEL ALONE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN ESTABLISHMENT
1069-133709-0002 I MEAN OF COURSE IF YOU'LL TAKE A COMPANION SOME DECAYED GENTLEWOMAN WITH A DARNED CASHMERE AND DYED HAIR WHO PAINTS ON VELVET YOU DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE
1069-133709-0003 SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
1069-133709-0004 THAT IT'S A GREAT DEAL BETTER YOU SHOULD REMAIN WITH ME IN SPITE OF THERE BEING NO OBLIGATION IT'S BETTER FOR SEVERAL REASONS QUITE APART FROM YOUR LIKING IT I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D LIKE IT BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
1069-133709-0005 SHE HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR WHAT WAS USUALLY DEEMED DECENT AND A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN WITHOUT VISIBLE RELATIONS HAD ALWAYS STRUCK HER AS A FLOWER WITHOUT FOLIAGE
1069-133709-0006 WHEN SHE SAT IN HER DAMP WATERPROOF AND SKETCHED THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EUROPE WOULD OFFER TO A YOUNG PERSON OF TASTE THIS HOWEVER WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE THE GIRL'S OWN FAULT SHE HAD GOT A GLIMPSE OF HER AUNT'S EXPERIENCE
1069-133709-0007 AND HER IMAGINATION CONSTANTLY ANTICIPATED THE JUDGEMENTS AND EMOTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD VERY LITTLE OF THE SAME FACULTY APART FROM THIS MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD A GREAT MERIT SHE WAS AS HONEST AS A PAIR OF COMPASSES
1069-133709-0008 BUT WAS NEVER OVER INQUISITIVE AS REGARDS THE TERRITORY OF HER NEIGHBOUR ISABEL CAME AT LAST TO HAVE A KIND OF UNDEMONSTRABLE PITY FOR HER THERE SEEMED SOMETHING SO DREARY IN THE CONDITION OF A PERSON WHOSE NATURE HAD AS IT WERE
1069-133709-0009 SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
1069-133709-0010 NO WIND SOWN BLOSSOM NO FAMILIAR SOFTENING MOSS HER OFFERED HER PASSIVE EXTENT IN OTHER WORDS WAS ABOUT THAT OF A KNIFE EDGE ISABEL HAD REASON TO BELIEVE NONE THE LESS
1069-133709-0011 SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
1069-133709-0012 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE LONGEST WAY ROUND TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HER INVALID SON
1069-133709-0013 THAT WHEN RALPH WISHED TO SEE HER HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO REMEMBER THAT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI CONTAINED A LARGE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE QUARTER OF THE SIGNORINO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
1069-133709-0014 ISABEL SAID TO THIS YOUNG MAN THE DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT SAN REMO SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE OF ASKING YOU BY LETTER BUT THAT I'VE HESITATED ON THE WHOLE TO WRITE ABOUT FACE TO FACE NEVERTHELESS
1069-133709-0015 WHAT DOES IT MATTER MY DEAR ISABEL WHETHER I KNEW MY FATHER WAS VERY OBSTINATE SO SAID THE GIRL YOU DID KNOW YES HE TOLD ME WE EVEN TALKED IT OVER A LITTLE
1069-133709-0016 ASKED ISABEL ABRUPTLY WHY AS A KIND OF COMPLIMENT A COMPLIMENT ON WHAT ON YOUR SO BEAUTIFULLY EXISTING HE LIKED ME TOO MUCH SHE PRESENTLY DECLARED THAT'S A WAY WE ALL HAVE
1069-133709-0017 IF I BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY FORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE IT I WANT TO BE TREATED WITH JUSTICE I WANT NOTHING BUT THAT VERY GOOD BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT JUSTICE TO A LOVELY BEING
1069-133709-0018 IS AFTER ALL A FLORID SORT OF SENTIMENT I'M NOT A LOVELY BEING HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I'M ASKING SUCH ODIOUS QUESTIONS I MUST SEEM TO YOU DELICATE
1069-133709-0019 YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
1069-133709-0020 HENRIETTA DOESN'T OH HANG HENRIETTA SAID RALPH COARSELY IF YOU ASK ME I'M DELIGHTED AT IT IS THAT WHY YOUR FATHER DID IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I DIFFER WITH MISS STACKPOLE
1069-133709-0021 RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
1069-133709-0022 DON'T QUESTION YOUR CONSCIENCE SO MUCH IT WILL GET OUT OF TUNE LIKE A STRUMMED PIANO KEEP IT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS DON'T TRY SO MUCH TO FORM YOUR CHARACTER IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PULL OPEN A TIGHT TENDER YOUNG ROSE
1069-133709-0023 LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
1069-133709-0024 ISABEL HAD LISTENED QUICKLY YOU'VE TOO MUCH POWER OF THOUGHT ABOVE ALL TOO MUCH CONSCIENCE RALPH ADDED IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU THINK WRONG PUT BACK YOUR WATCH DIET YOUR FEVER
1069-133709-0025 IT'S NEVER WRONG TO DO THAT SHE HAD LISTENED EAGERLY AS I SAY AND IT WAS HER NATURE TO UNDERSTAND QUICKLY I WONDER IF YOU APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU DO YOU TAKE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU FRIGHTEN ME A LITTLE
1069-133709-0026 BUT I THINK I'M RIGHT SAID RALPH PERSISTING IN CHEER ALL THE SAME WHAT YOU SAY IS VERY TRUE ISABEL PURSUED YOU COULD SAY NOTHING MORE TRUE I'M ABSORBED IN MYSELF I LOOK AT LIFE TOO MUCH AS A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION
1069-133709-0027 WHY INDEED SHOULD WE PERPETUALLY BE THINKING WHETHER THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US AS IF WE WERE PATIENTS LYING IN A HOSPITAL WHY SHOULD I BE SO AFRAID OF NOT DOING RIGHT AS IF IT MATTERED TO THE WORLD WHETHER I DO RIGHT OR WRONG
1069-133709-0028 YOU'RE A CAPITAL PERSON TO ADVISE SAID RALPH YOU TAKE THE WIND OUT OF MY SAILS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM THOUGH SHE WAS FOLLOWING OUT THE TRAIN OF REFLEXION WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD KINDLED
1069-133709-0029 A LARGE FORTUNE MEANS FREEDOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THAT IT'S SUCH A FINE THING AND ONE SHOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD USE OF IT IF ONE SHOULDN'T ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED AND ONE MUST KEEP THINKING IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT
1069-133709-0030 I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT A GREATER HAPPINESS TO BE POWERLESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S A GREATER HAPPINESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE THE EFFORT NOT TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE MUST BE GREAT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT WEAK ISABEL ASKED
1069-133709-0031 THE GATE OF ADMIRATIONS ITALY AS YET IMPERFECTLY SEEN AND FELT STRETCHED BEFORE HER AS A LAND OF PROMISE A LAND IN WHICH A LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MIGHT BE COMFORTED BY ENDLESS KNOWLEDGE
1069-133709-0032 WHENEVER SHE STROLLED UPON THE SHORE WITH HER COUSIN AND SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DAILY WALK SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA WITH LONGING EYES TO WHERE SHE KNEW THAT GENOA LAY
1069-133709-0033 SHE WAS GLAD TO PAUSE HOWEVER ON THE EDGE OF THIS LARGER ADVENTURE THERE WAS SUCH A THRILL EVEN IN THE PRELIMINARY HOVERING IT AFFECTED HER MOREOVER AS A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE AS A HUSH OF THE DRUM AND FIFE IN A CAREER WHICH SHE HAD LITTLE WARRANT
1069-133709-0034 AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
1069-133709-0035 MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
1069-133709-0036 GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
1069-133709-0037 IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
1069-133709-0038 WERE SUBLIME IN THE MASS HER FORTUNE THEREFORE BECAME TO HER MIND A PART OF HER BETTER SELF IT GAVE HER IMPORTANCE GAVE HER EVEN TO HER OWN IMAGINATION A CERTAIN IDEAL BEAUTY
1069-133709-0039 WHICH IN SPITE OF INCREASING DISTANCE WERE STILL SUFFICIENTLY SALIENT THEY WERE RECOGNISABLE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
1069-133709-0040 SHE COULD SUMMON BACK HER FAITH IN CASE OF NEED WITH AN EFFORT BUT THE EFFORT WAS OFTEN PAINFUL EVEN WHEN THE REALITY HAD BEEN PLEASANT THE PAST WAS APT TO LOOK DEAD AND ITS REVIVAL RATHER TO SHOW THE
1069-133709-0041 LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
1069-133709-0042 SHE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING WOUNDED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BUT OF ALL LIBERTIES THE ONE SHE HERSELF FOUND SWEETEST WAS THE LIBERTY TO FORGET SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER LAST SHILLING SENTIMENTALLY SPEAKING
1069-133709-0043 EITHER TO CASPAR GOODWOOD OR TO LORD WARBURTON AND YET COULDN'T BUT FEEL THEM APPRECIABLY IN DEBT TO HER SHE HAD OF COURSE REMINDED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM MISTER GOODWOOD AGAIN BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF
1069-133709-0044 AND IN THAT TIME A GREAT MANY THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SHE HAD INDEED FAILED TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT HER AMERICAN SUITOR MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER GIRL MORE COMFORTABLE TO WOO BECAUSE THOUGH IT WAS CERTAIN MANY OTHER GIRLS WOULD PROVE SO
1069-133709-0045 SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST BELIEF THAT THIS MERIT WOULD ATTRACT HIM BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT KNOW THE HUMILIATION OF CHANGE MIGHT REALLY FOR THAT MATTER COME TO THE END OF THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT CASPAR
1069-133709-0046 A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE
1069-133709-0047 SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
1069-133709-0048 WOULD BE EMINENTLY JUST THIS WAS NOT AS IT MAY SEEM MERELY A THEORY TINGED WITH SARCASM ISABEL CANDIDLY BELIEVED THAT HIS LORDSHIP WOULD IN THE USUAL PHRASE GET OVER HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
1069-133709-0049 HE HAD BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED THIS SHE BELIEVED AND SHE WAS STILL CAPABLE OF DERIVING PLEASURE FROM THE BELIEF BUT IT WAS ABSURD THAT A MAN BOTH SO INTELLIGENT AND SO HONOURABLY DEALT WITH
1069-133709-0050 SHOULD CULTIVATE A SCAR OUT OF PROPORTION TO ANY WOUND ENGLISHMEN LIKED MOREOVER TO BE COMFORTABLE SAID ISABEL AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE COMFORT FOR LORD WARBURTON IN THE LONG RUN IN BROODING OVER A SELF SUFFICIENT AMERICAN GIRL
1069-133709-0051 WHO HAD BEEN BUT A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHOULD SHE HEAR FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER THAT HE HAD MARRIED SOME YOUNG WOMAN OF HIS OWN COUNTRY WHO HAD DONE MORE TO DESERVE HIM
1069-133709-0052 SHE SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEWS WITHOUT A PANG EVEN OF SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS FIRM WHICH WAS WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEEM TO HIM
1502-122619-0000 BRIEF I PRAY FOR YOU FOR YOU SEE TIS A BUSY TIME WITH ME MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE TRIBE OR RATHER HALF TRIBE OF DELAWARES
1502-122619-0001 COULD ASSEMBLE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WARRIORS WITH THE LATTER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY HAD FOLLOWED MONTCALM INTO THE TERRITORIES OF THE ENGLISH CROWN AND WERE MAKING HEAVY AND SERIOUS INROADS ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE MOHAWKS
1502-122619-0002 THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN FIT WITH THE MYSTERIOUS RESERVE SO COMMON AMONG THE NATIVES TO WITHHOLD THEIR ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST REQUIRED THE FRENCH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DEFECTION ON THE PART OF THEIR ALLY
1502-122619-0003 IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
1502-122619-0004 THAT HAD ONCE MADE THEM DEPENDENT ON THE SIX NATIONS FOR MILITARY PROTECTION AND NOW RENDERED THEM RELUCTANT TO ENCOUNTER THEIR FORMER MASTERS AS FOR THE TRIBE ITSELF IT HAD BEEN CONTENT TO ANNOUNCE TO MONTCALM THROUGH HIS EMISSARIES WITH INDIAN BREVITY
1502-122619-0005 THAT THEIR HATCHETS WERE DULL AND TIME WAS NECESSARY TO SHARPEN THEM THE POLITIC CAPTAIN OF THE CANADAS HAD DEEMED IT WISER TO SUBMIT TO ENTERTAIN A PASSIVE FRIEND THAN BY ANY ACTS OF ILL JUDGED SEVERITY TO CONVERT HIM INTO AN OPEN ENEMY
1502-122619-0006 ON THAT MORNING WHEN MAGUA LED HIS SILENT PARTY FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF THE BEAVERS INTO THE FORESTS IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED THE SUN ROSE UPON THE DELAWARE ENCAMPMENT AS IF IT HAD SUDDENLY BURST UPON A BUSY PEOPLE
1502-122619-0007 THE WOMEN RAN FROM LODGE TO LODGE
1502-122619-0008 A FEW EARNESTLY BENT ON SEEKING THE COMFORTS NECESSARY TO THEIR HABITS BUT MORE PAUSING TO EXCHANGE HASTY AND WHISPERED SENTENCES WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE WARRIORS WERE LOUNGING IN GROUPS
1502-122619-0009 THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
1502-122619-0010 WHEN NO OTHER ENEMY THAN THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST IS EXPECTED TO BE ENCOUNTERED AND OCCASIONALLY THE EYES OF A WHOLE GROUP WERE TURNED SIMULTANEOUSLY
1502-122619-0011 AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
1502-122619-0012 HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
1502-122619-0013 BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
1502-122619-0014 FORTIFIED BY THESE ASSURANCES THE DARK FIGURE LEFT THE BROW OF THE NATURAL ROCKY TERRACE
1502-122619-0015 HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
1502-122619-0016 HIS RECEPTION WAS GRAVE SILENT AND WARY THE WARRIORS IN FRONT STEPPED ASIDE OPENING THE WAY TO THEIR MOST APPROVED ORATOR BY THE ACTION
1502-122619-0017 ONE WHO SPOKE ALL THOSE LANGUAGES THAT WERE CULTIVATED AMONG THE NORTHERN ABORIGINES THE WISE HURON IS WELCOME SAID THE DELAWARE
1502-122619-0018 COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
1502-122619-0019 HE IS COME REPEATED MAGUA BENDING HIS HEAD WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN EASTERN PRINCE THE CHIEF EXTENDED HIS ARM AND TAKING THE OTHER BY THE WRIST THEY ONCE MORE EXCHANGED FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS
1502-122619-0020 THEN THE DELAWARE INVITED HIS GUEST TO ENTER HIS OWN LODGE AND SHARE HIS MORNING MEAL THE INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED AND THE TWO WARRIORS ATTENDED BY THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLD MEN WALKED CALMLY AWAY
1502-122619-0021 LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
1502-122619-0022 AND RELATED ENTIRELY TO THE EVENTS OF THE HUNT IN WHICH MAGUA HAD SO LATELY BEEN ENGAGED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST FINISHED BREEDING TO WEAR MORE OF THE APPEARANCE OF CONSIDERING THE VISIT AS A THING OF COURSE THAN DID HIS HOSTS
1502-122619-0023 NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENT WAS PERFECTLY AWARE
1502-122619-0024 IS THE FACE OF MY GREAT CANADA FATHER TURNED AGAIN TOWARD HIS HURON CHILDREN
1502-122619-0025 WHEN WAS IT EVER OTHERWISE RETURNED MAGUA HE CALLS MY PEOPLE MOST BELOVED THE DELAWARE GRAVELY BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE TO WHAT HE KNEW TO BE FALSE AND CONTINUED
1502-122619-0026 THE TOMAHAWKS OF YOUR YOUNG MEN HAVE BEEN VERY RED IT IS SO BUT THEY ARE NOW BRIGHT AND DULL FOR THE YENGEESE ARE DEAD AND THE DELAWARES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS
1502-122619-0027 THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
1502-122619-0028 DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
1502-122619-0029 SHE IS WELCOME RETURNED THE CHIEF OF THE LATTER NATION STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY THE BAFFLED MAGUA CONTINUED SILENT SEVERAL MINUTES APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT HOWEVER TO THE REPULSE HE HAD RECEIVED
1502-122619-0030 IN THIS HIS OPENING EFFORT TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF CORA DO MY YOUNG MEN LEAVE THE DELAWARES ROOM ON THE MOUNTAINS FOR THEIR HUNTS HE AT LENGTH CONTINUED
1502-122619-0031 IT IS WELL JUSTICE IS THE MASTER OF A RED SKIN WHY SHOULD THEY BRIGHTEN THEIR TOMAHAWKS AND SHARPEN THEIR KNIVES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE NOT THE PALE FACES THICKER THAN THE SWALLOWS IN THE SEASON OF FLOWERS
1502-122619-0032 GOOD EXCLAIMED TWO OR THREE OF HIS AUDITORS AT THE SAME TIME
1502-122619-0033 TO PERMIT HIS WORDS TO SOFTEN THE FEELINGS OF THE DELAWARES BEFORE HE ADDED HAVE THERE NOT BEEN STRANGE MOCCASINS IN THE WOODS HAVE NOT MY BROTHERS SCENTED THE FEET OF WHITE MEN
1502-122619-0034 LET MY CANADA FATHER COME RETURNED THE OTHER EVASIVELY HIS CHILDREN ARE READY TO SEE HIM WHEN THE GREAT CHIEF COMES IT IS TO SMOKE WITH THE INDIANS IN THEIR WIGWAMS THE HURONS SAY TOO HE IS WELCOME
1502-122619-0035 BUT THE YENGEESE HAVE LONG ARMS AND LEGS THAT NEVER TIRE
1502-122619-0036 IT IS WELL THE WARRIOR WHOSE EYE IS OPEN CAN SEE HIS ENEMY SAID MAGUA ONCE MORE SHIFTING HIS GROUND
1502-122619-0037 AND GRAVELY SPREAD HIS PRESENTS BEFORE THE DAZZLED EYES OF HIS HOSTS THEY CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF TRINKETS OF LITTLE VALUE PLUNDERED FROM THE SLAUGHTERED FEMALES OF WILLIAM HENRY
1502-122619-0038 IN THE DIVISION OF THE BAUBLES THE CUNNING HURON DISCOVERED NO LESS ART THAN IN THEIR SELECTION WHILE HE BESTOWED THOSE OF GREATER VALUE ON THE TWO MOST DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS HOST HE SEASONED HIS OFFERINGS TO THEIR INFERIORS
1502-122619-0039 COMPLIMENTS AS LEFT THEM NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT IN SHORT THE WHOLE CEREMONY CONTAINED SUCH A HAPPY BLENDING OF THE PROFITABLE WITH THE FLATTERING THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THE DONOR IMMEDIATELY TO READ THE EFFECT OF A GENEROSITY
1502-122619-0040 SO APTLY MINGLED WITH PRAISE IN THE EYES OF THOSE HE ADDRESSED THIS WELL JUDGED AND POLITIC STROKE ON THE PART OF MAGUA WAS NOT WITHOUT INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS
1502-122619-0041 MY BROTHER IS A WISE CHIEF HE IS WELCOME THE HURONS LOVE THEIR FRIENDS THE DELAWARES RETURNED MAGUA WHY SHOULD THEY NOT THEY ARE COLORED BY THE SAME SUN AND THEIR JUST MEN WILL HUNT IN THE SAME GROUNDS AFTER DEATH
1502-122619-0042 THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
1502-122619-0043 AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
1502-122619-0044 WOULD THE YENGEESE SEND THEIR WOMEN AS SPIES DID NOT THE HURON CHIEF SAY HE TOOK WOMEN IN THE BATTLE HE TOLD NO LIE THE YENGEESE HAVE SENT OUT THEIR SCOUTS
1502-122619-0045 THEN THEY FLED TO THE DELAWARES FOR SAY THEY THE DELAWARES ARE OUR FRIENDS THEIR MINDS ARE TURNED FROM THEIR CANADA FATHER THIS INSINUATION WAS A HOME THRUST
1502-122619-0046 WOULD HAVE ENTITLED MAGUA TO THE REPUTATION OF A SKILLFUL DIPLOMATIST THE RECENT DEFECTION OF THE TRIBE HAD AS THEY WELL KNEW THEMSELVES SUBJECTED THE DELAWARES TO MUCH REPROACH AMONG THEIR FRENCH ALLIES
1502-122619-0047 AND THEY WERE NOW MADE TO FEEL THAT THEIR FUTURE ACTIONS WERE TO BE REGARDED WITH JEALOUSY AND DISTRUST THERE WAS NO DEEP INSIGHT INTO CAUSES AND EFFECTS NECESSARY TO FORESEE
1502-122619-0048 THAT SUCH A SITUATION OF THINGS WAS LIKELY TO PROVE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL TO THEIR FUTURE MOVEMENTS THEIR DISTANT VILLAGES THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS
1502-122619-0049 TOGETHER WITH A MATERIAL PART OF THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE WERE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY ACCORDINGLY THIS ALARMING ANNUNCIATION WAS RECEIVED AS MAGUA INTENDED
1502-122619-0050 WITH MANIFEST DISAPPROBATION IF NOT WITH ALARM
1502-122619-0051 HE WILL SEE NO CHANGE IT IS TRUE MY YOUNG MEN DID NOT GO OUT ON THE WAR PATH THEY HAD DREAMS FOR NOT DOING SO BUT THEY LOVE AND VENERATE THE GREAT WHITE CHIEF
1502-122619-0052 WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
1502-122619-0053 THAT THE PALE FACE WHO HAS SLAIN SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS GOES IN AND OUT AMONG THE DELAWARES GO MY GREAT CANADA FATHER IS NOT A FOOL
1502-122619-0054 LA LONGUE CARABINE THE DELAWARE WARRIORS STARTED AT THE WELL KNOWN NAME BETRAYING BY THEIR AMAZEMENT THAT THEY NOW LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE SO FAMOUS AMONG THE INDIAN ALLIES OF FRANCE WAS WITHIN THEIR POWER
1502-122619-0055 WHAT DOES MY BROTHER MEAN DEMANDED LE COEUR DUR IN A TONE THAT BY ITS WONDER FAR EXCEEDED THE USUAL APATHY OF HIS RACE A HURON NEVER LIES RETURNED MAGUA COLDLY
1502-122619-0056 A LONG AND MUSING PAUSE SUCCEEDED THE CHIEF CONSULTED APART WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND MESSENGERS DESPATCHED TO COLLECT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF THE TRIBE AS WARRIOR AFTER WARRIOR DROPPED IN
1502-122619-0057 THE NEWS SPREAD FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH UNTIL THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT BECAME POWERFULLY AGITATED THE WOMEN SUSPENDED THEIR LABORS TO CATCH SUCH SYLLABLES AS UNGUARDEDLY FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE CONSULTING WARRIORS
1502-122619-0058 THE BOYS DESERTED THEIR SPORTS AND WALKING FEARLESSLY AMONG THEIR FATHERS LOOKED UP IN CURIOUS ADMIRATION AS THEY HEARD THE BRIEF EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER THEY SO FREELY EXPRESSED THE TEMERITY OF THEIR HATED FOE
1502-122619-0059 IN SHORT EVERY OCCUPATION WAS ABANDONED FOR THE TIME AND ALL OTHER PURSUITS SEEMED DISCARDED IN ORDER THAT THE TRIBE MIGHT FREELY INDULGE AFTER THEIR OWN PECULIAR MANNER IN AN OPEN EXPRESSION OF FEELING
1502-122619-0060 THE OLD MEN DISPOSED THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THAT WHICH IT BECAME THE HONOR AND SAFETY OF THEIR TRIBE TO PERFORM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MUCH DELICACY AND EMBARRASSMENT
1502-122619-0061 MAGUA HAD NOT ONLY MAINTAINED HIS SEAT BUT THE VERY ATTITUDE HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE LODGE
1502-122619-0062 AND APPARENTLY AS UNCONCERNED AS IF HE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE RESULT
1502-122619-0063 ESCAPED HIS VIGILANT EYES
1502-122619-0064 HE ANTICIPATED EVERY MEASURE ON WHICH THEY DECIDED AND IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID
1502-122619-0065 AND FORMAL ASSEMBLAGE OF THE NATION AS SUCH MEETINGS WERE RARE AND ONLY CALLED ON OCCASIONS OF THE LAST IMPORTANCE THE SUBTLE HURON WHO STILL SAT APART
1502-122619-0066 NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
1502-122619-0067 IN FRONT OF THE ENCAMPMENT WHITHER THE WARRIORS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COLLECT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING EVEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WAS IN HIS PLACE
1502-122619-0068 THE DELAY HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE GRAVE PREPARATIONS THAT WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SO SOLEMN AND UNUSUAL A CONFERENCE BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SEEN CLIMBING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THAT MOUNTAIN
1502-122619-0069 ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
1502-122619-0070 STANDING READY TO MOVE HIS AUDITORS TO SOME HASTY AND PERHAPS INJUDICIOUS DISCUSSION
1502-122619-0071 UNTIL SUCH A ONE CHOSE TO MAKE SOME MOVEMENT NO DEEDS IN ARMS NO NATURAL GIFTS NOR ANY RENOWN AS AN ORATOR
1502-122619-0072 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THE AGED WARRIOR WHOSE PRIVILEGE IT WAS TO SPEAK WAS SILENT SEEMINGLY OPPRESSED WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS SUBJECT THE DELAY HAD ALREADY CONTINUED LONG BEYOND THE USUAL DELIBERATIVE PAUSE
1502-122619-0073 THAT ALWAYS PRECEDED A CONFERENCE BUT NO SIGN OF IMPATIENCE OR SURPRISE ESCAPED EVEN THE YOUNGEST BOY OCCASIONALLY AN EYE WAS RAISED FROM THE EARTH WHERE THE LOOKS OF MOST WERE RIVETED
1502-122619-0074 AND THREE MEN ISSUING FROM IT SLOWLY APPROACHED THE PLACE OF CONSULTATION THEY WERE ALL AGED EVEN BEYOND THAT PERIOD TO WHICH THE OLDEST PRESENT HAD REACHED BUT ONE IN THE CENTER WHO LEANED ON HIS COMPANIONS FOR SUPPORT
1502-122619-0075 HAD NUMBERED AN AMOUNT OF YEARS TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS SELDOM PERMITTED TO ATTAIN HIS FRAME WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN TALL AND ERECT LIKE THE CEDAR WAS NOW BENDING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MORE THAN A CENTURY
1502-122619-0076 THE ELASTIC LIGHT STEP OF AN INDIAN WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO TOIL HIS TARDY WAY OVER THE GROUND
1502-122619-0077 HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
1502-122619-0078 SINCE THEY HAD LAST BEEN SHORN THE DRESS OF THIS PATRIARCH FOR SUCH CONSIDERING HIS VAST AGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS AFFINITY AND INFLUENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE HE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TERMED
1502-122619-0079 WAS RICH AND IMPOSING THOUGH STRICTLY AFTER THE SIMPLE FASHIONS OF THE TRIBE HIS ROBE WAS OF THE FINEST SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR FUR
1502-122619-0080 OF VARIOUS DEEDS IN ARMS DONE IN FORMER AGES HIS BOSOM WAS LOADED WITH MEDALS SOME IN MASSIVE SILVER AND ONE OR TWO EVEN IN GOLD
1502-122619-0081 HE ALSO WORE ARMLETS AND CINCTURES ABOVE THE ANKLES OF THE LATTER PRECIOUS METAL
1502-122619-0082 IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
1502-122619-0083 WHICH THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THIS VENERATED INDIVIDUAL CREATED HAD A LITTLE SUBSIDED
1502-122619-0084 WAS WHISPERED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH MAGUA HAD OFTEN HEARD THE FAME OF THIS WISE AND JUST DELAWARE
1502-122619-0085 WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT AND WHICH HAS SINCE TRANSMITTED HIS NAME WITH SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE WHITE USURPERS OF HIS ANCIENT TERRITORY
1502-122619-0086 THE HURON CHIEF THEREFORE STEPPED EAGERLY OUT A LITTLE FROM THE THRONG
1502-122619-0087 WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
1502-122619-0088 THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
1502-122619-0089 THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN WERE CLOSED AS THOUGH THE ORGANS WERE WEARIED WITH HAVING SO LONG WITNESSED THE SELFISH WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN PASSIONS
1502-122619-0090 WITH THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH AND THE AIR OF A FATHER
1502-122619-0091 WHO BELONGS RATHER TO ANOTHER WORLD THAN TO THIS WAS RECEIVED BY HIS PEOPLE AFTER A SUITABLE AND DECENT PAUSE
1502-122619-0092 AND APPROACHING THE PATRIARCH THEY PLACED HIS HANDS REVERENTLY ON THEIR HEADS SEEMING TO ENTREAT A BLESSING THE YOUNGER MEN WERE CONTENT WITH TOUCHING HIS ROBE OR EVEN DRAWING NIGH HIS PERSON
1502-122619-0093 SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
1502-122619-0094 THE CHIEFS DREW BACK AGAIN TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT
1502-122619-0095 AROSE LEFT THE CROWD AND ENTERED THE LODGE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED AS THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THAT MORNING
1502-122619-0096 ESCORTING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD CAUSED ALL THESE SOLEMN PREPARATIONS TOWARD THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT THE CROWD OPENED IN A LANE AND WHEN THE PARTY HAD RE ENTERED
307-127539-0000 THERE NEVER WAS SUCH AN OVERTURN IN THIS WORLD EACH OF THESE SIX MEN WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STRUCK
307-127539-0001 EVERY THOUGHT OF HIS SOUL HAD BEEN SET FULL STRETCH LIKE A RACER ON THAT MONEY WELL HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SINGLE SECOND DEAD AND HE KEPT HIS HEAD FOUND HIS TEMPER AND CHANGED HIS PLAN BEFORE THE OTHERS HAD HAD TIME TO REALIZE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
307-127539-0002 HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
307-127539-0003 HIS LOOKS WERE NOT QUITE FRIENDLY AND I WAS SO REVOLTED AT THESE CONSTANT CHANGES THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING SO YOU'VE CHANGED SIDES AGAIN THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR HIM TO ANSWER IN
307-127539-0004 AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
307-127539-0005 TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER

307-127539-0008 DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
307-127539-0009 AND NOBODY SCREWED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO OFFER THE FIRST BLOW SILVER NEVER MOVED HE WATCHED THEM VERY UPRIGHT ON HIS CRUTCH AND LOOKED AS COOL AS EVER I SAW HIM HE WAS BRAVE AND NO MISTAKE
307-127539-0010 AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
307-127539-0011 ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
307-127539-0012 AND PLAINLY MEANT TO LEAD A CHARGE BUT JUST THEN CRACK CRACK CRACK THREE MUSKET SHOTS FLASHED OUT OF THE THICKET MERRY TUMBLED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0013 THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
307-127539-0014 BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
307-127539-0015 SOMETIMES PLUNGING THROUGH THE BUSHES TO THE CHEST I TELL YOU BUT SILVER WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP UP WITH US THE WORK THAT MAN WENT THROUGH
307-127539-0016 WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
307-127539-0017 NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
307-127539-0018 WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
307-127539-0019 CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS

307-127539-0023 HE HAD CARRIED IT ON HIS BACK IN MANY WEARY JOURNEYS FROM THE FOOT OF THE TALL PINE TO A CAVE HE HAD ON THE TWO POINTED HILL AT THE NORTH EAST ANGLE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IT HAD LAIN STORED IN SAFETY SINCE TWO MONTHS
307-127539-0024 GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
307-127539-0025 AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
307-127539-0026 AND LEAVING THE SQUIRE TO GUARD THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN GRAY AND THE MAROON AND STARTED MAKING THE DIAGONAL ACROSS THE ISLAND TO BE AT HAND BESIDE THE PINE SOON HOWEVER HE SAW THAT OUR PARTY HAD THE START OF HIM AND BEN GUNN BEING FLEET OF FOOT
307-127539-0027 HAD BEEN DISPATCHED IN FRONT TO DO HIS BEST ALONE THEN IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORK UPON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS FORMER SHIPMATES
307-127539-0028 NOT A THOUGHT REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY CHEERILY AND BY THIS TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GIGS
307-127539-0029 THIS WAS A RUN OF EIGHT OR NINE MILES SILVER THOUGH HE WAS ALMOST KILLED ALREADY WITH FATIGUE WAS SET TO AN OAR LIKE THE REST OF US AND WE WERE SOON SKIMMING SWIFTLY OVER A SMOOTH SEA
307-127539-0030 AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
307-127539-0031 WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
307-127539-0032 ANOTHER ANCHOR WAS GOT READY AND DROPPED IN A FATHOM AND A HALF OF WATER WE ALL PULLED ROUND AGAIN TO RUM COVE THE NEAREST POINT FOR BEN GUNN'S TREASURE HOUSE AND THEN GRAY SINGLE HANDED RETURNED WITH THE GIG TO THE HISPANIOLA
307-127539-0033 WHERE HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT ON GUARD A GENTLE SLOPE RAN UP FROM THE BEACH TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AT THE TOP THE SQUIRE MET US
307-127539-0034 TO ME HE WAS CORDIAL AND KIND SAYING NOTHING OF MY ESCAPADE EITHER IN THE WAY OF BLAME OR PRAISE AT SILVER'S POLITE SALUTE HE SOMEWHAT FLUSHED JOHN SILVER

307-127539-0037 I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA

307-127539-0040 COME IN JIM SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU'RE A GOOD BOY IN YOUR LINE JIM BUT I DON'T THINK YOU AND ME'LL GO TO SEA AGAIN YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF THE BORN FAVOURITE FOR ME
307-127539-0041 AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
307-127540-0000 THE THREE FELLOWS STILL ABROAD UPON THE ISLAND DID NOT GREATLY TROUBLE US A SINGLE SENTRY ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE US AGAINST ANY SUDDEN ONSLAUGHT AND WE THOUGHT BESIDES THEY HAD HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF FIGHTING
307-127540-0001 THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
307-127540-0002 TWO OF THE BARS SLUNG IN A ROPE'S END MADE A GOOD LOAD FOR A GROWN MAN ONE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO WALK SLOWLY WITH FOR MY PART
307-127540-0003 THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
307-127540-0004 NEARLY EVERY VARIETY OF MONEY IN THE WORLD MUST I THINK HAVE FOUND A PLACE IN THAT COLLECTION AND FOR NUMBER I AM SURE THEY WERE LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES SO THAT MY BACK ACHED WITH STOOPING AND MY FINGERS WITH SORTING THEM OUT
307-127540-0005 AT LAST I THINK IT WAS ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE DOCTOR AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHERE IT OVERLOOKS THE LOWLANDS OF THE ISLE
307-127540-0006 THE WIND BROUGHT US A NOISE BETWEEN SHRIEKING AND SINGING IT WAS ONLY A SNATCH THAT REACHED OUR EARS FOLLOWED BY THE FORMER SILENCE HEAVEN FORGIVE THEM SAID THE DOCTOR TIS THE MUTINEERS
307-127540-0007 ALL DRUNK SIR STRUCK IN THE VOICE OF SILVER FROM BEHIND US SILVER I SHOULD SAY WAS ALLOWED HIS ENTIRE LIBERTY AND IN SPITE OF DAILY REBUFFS SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF ONCE MORE AS QUITE A PRIVILEGED AND FRIENDLY DEPENDENT
307-127540-0008 INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
307-127540-0009 WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
307-127540-0010 FOR I HAD SEEN HIM MEDITATING A FRESH TREACHERY UPON THE PLATEAU ACCORDINGLY IT WAS PRETTY GRUFFLY THAT THE DOCTOR ANSWERED HIM DRUNK OR RAVING SAID HE RIGHT YOU WERE SIR REPLIED SILVER
307-127540-0011 AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
307-127540-0012 BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
307-127540-0013 NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
307-127540-0014 A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
307-127540-0015 A FEW MEDICINES AND SOME OTHER NECESSARIES TOOLS CLOTHING A SPARE SAIL A FATHOM OR TWO OF ROPE AND BY THE PARTICULAR DESIRE OF THE DOCTOR A HANDSOME PRESENT OF TOBACCO THAT WAS ABOUT OUR LAST DOING ON THE ISLAND
307-127540-0016 AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
307-127540-0017 AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
307-127540-0018 LEAPT TO HIS FEET WITH A HOARSE CRY WHIPPED HIS MUSKET TO HIS SHOULDER AND SENT A SHOT WHISTLING OVER SILVER'S HEAD
307-127540-0019 AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
307-127540-0020 AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
307-127540-0021 ONLY THE CAPTAIN LYING ON A MATTRESS IN THE STERN AND GIVING HIS ORDERS FOR THOUGH GREATLY RECOVERED HE WAS STILL IN WANT OF QUIET WE LAID HER HEAD FOR THE NEAREST PORT IN SPANISH AMERICA FOR WE COULD NOT RISK THE VOYAGE HOME WITHOUT FRESH HANDS
307-127540-0022 AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
307-127540-0023 THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
307-127540-0024 TO PASS THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT HERE THEY MET THE CAPTAIN OF AN ENGLISH MAN OF WAR FELL IN TALK WITH HIM WENT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND IN SHORT HAD SO AGREEABLE A TIME THAT DAY WAS BREAKING WHEN WE CAME ALONGSIDE THE HISPANIOLA
307-127540-0025 SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
307-127540-0026 THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
307-127540-0027 WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
307-127540-0028 WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WE GOT A FEW HANDS ON BOARD MADE A GOOD CRUISE HOME AND THE HISPANIOLA REACHED BRISTOL JUST AS MISTER BLANDLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF FITTING OUT HER CONSORT FIVE MEN ONLY OF THOSE WHO HAD SAILED RETURNED WITH HER
307-127540-0029 AS THAT OTHER SHIP THEY SANG ABOUT WITH ONE MAN OF HER CREW ALIVE WHAT PUT TO SEA WITH SEVENTY FIVE ALL OF US HAD AN AMPLE SHARE OF THE TREASURE AND USED IT WISELY OR FOOLISHLY ACCORDING TO OUR NATURES
307-127540-0030 CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
307-127540-0031 MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
307-127540-0032 OF SILVER WE HAVE HEARD NO MORE THAT FORMIDABLE SEAFARING MAN WITH ONE LEG HAS AT LAST GONE CLEAN OUT OF MY LIFE
307-127540-0033 AND PERHAPS STILL LIVES IN COMFORT WITH HER AND CAPTAIN FLINT IT IS TO BE HOPED SO I SUPPOSE FOR HIS CHANCES OF COMFORT IN ANOTHER WORLD ARE VERY SMALL THE BAR SILVER
307-127540-0034 AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
307-127540-0035 AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
5339-14134-0000 OF THE NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT ARRIVED IN MONKSHAVEN THE FOSTERS SHOPKEEPERS AND BANKERS HAD THE LARGEST SHARE THE MORNING SUCCEEDING THE DAY ON WHICH SYLVIA HAD ENGAGED HERSELF TO KINRAID THE FOSTERS SEEMED UNUSUALLY ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN THEIR LETTERS
5339-14134-0001 SEVERAL TIMES JEREMIAH CAME OUT OF THE PARLOUR IN WHICH HIS BROTHER JOHN WAS SITTING IN EXPECTANT SILENCE AND PASSING THROUGH THE SHOP LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE MARKET PLACE IN SEARCH OF THE OLD LAME WOMAN WHO WAS CHARITABLY EMPLOYED TO DELIVER LETTERS
5339-14134-0002 AND WHO MUST HAVE BEEN LAMER THAN EVER THIS MORNING TO JUDGE FROM THE LATENESS OF HER COMING ALTHOUGH NONE BUT THE FOSTERS KNEW THE CAUSE OF THEIR IMPATIENCE FOR THEIR LETTERS YET THERE WAS SUCH TACIT SYMPATHY BETWEEN THEM AND THOSE WHOM THEY EMPLOYED
5339-14134-0003 WITH HER BASKET OF LETTERS ONE OF THESE SEEMED OF ESPECIAL CONSEQUENCE TO THE GOOD BROTHERS THEY EACH SEPARATELY LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION AND THEN AT ONE ANOTHER AND WITHOUT A WORD THEY RETURNED WITH IT UNREAD INTO THE PARLOUR SHUTTING THE DOOR AND DRAWING THE GREEN SILK CURTAIN CLOSE THE BETTER TO READ IT IN PRIVACY
5339-14134-0004 AND WERE PERHAPS AS FULL OF CONSIDERATION AS TO THE POSSIBLE CONTENTS OF THIS LONDON LETTER
5339-14134-0005 A MINUTE AGO PHILIP AND HE WERE ON A LEVEL OF IGNORANCE FROM WHICH THE FORMER WAS EVIDENTLY GOING TO BE RAISED BUT HE SOON RETURNED TO HIS USUAL STATE OF ACQUIESCENCE IN THINGS AS THEY WERE WHICH WAS PARTLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND PARTLY THE RESULT OF HIS QUAKER TRAINING
5339-14134-0006 IT WAS APPARENTLY BY JOHN FOSTER'S WISH THAT PHILIP HAD BEEN SUMMONED JEREMIAH THE LESS ENERGETIC AND DECIDED BROTHER WAS STILL DISCUSSING THE PROPRIETY OF THE STEP WHEN PHILIP ENTERED
5339-14134-0007 THAT THE FOSTERS HAD FOR SOME TIME RECEIVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS WARNING THEM WITH DISTINCT MEANING THOUGH IN AMBIGUOUS TERMS AGAINST A CERTAIN SILK MANUFACTURER IN SPITALFIELDS WITH WHOM THEY HAD HAD STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS DEALINGS FOR MANY YEARS
5339-14134-0008 BUT TO WHOM THEY HAD LATTERLY ADVANCED MONEY THE LETTERS HINTED AT THE UTTER INSOLVENCY OF THIS MANUFACTURER THEY HAD URGED THEIR CORRESPONDENT TO GIVE THEM HIS NAME IN CONFIDENCE AND THIS MORNING'S LETTER HAD BROUGHT IT
5339-14134-0009 BUT THE NAME WAS TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO THEM THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO DOUBT THE REALITY OF EITHER IT OR THE ADDRESS THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS GIVEN IN FULL
5339-14134-0010 AND WAS PUBLICLY DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS EXCELLENT AND PHILANTHROPIC CHARACTER BUT THESE LETTERS WERE PROVOCATIVE OF ANXIETY ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MORNING'S POST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE WRITER'S FULL NAME AND VARIOUS PARTICULARS SHOWING HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF DICKINSON'S AFFAIRS
5339-14134-0011 AFTER MUCH PERPLEXED CONSULTATION JOHN HAD HIT UPON THE PLAN OF SENDING HEPBURN TO LONDON TO MAKE SECRET INQUIRIES RESPECTING THE TRUE CHARACTER AND COMMERCIAL POSITION OF THE MAN WHOSE CREDITORS NOT A MONTH AGO THEY HAD ESTEEMED IT AN HONOUR TO BE
5339-14134-0012 EVEN NOW JEREMIAH WAS ASHAMED OF THEIR WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ONE SO GOOD HE BELIEVED THAT THE INFORMATION THEY HAD RECEIVED WOULD ALL PROVE A MISTAKE FOUNDED ON ERRONEOUS GROUNDS IF NOT A PURE INVENTION OF AN ENEMY
5339-14134-0013 AND HE HAD ONLY BEEN BROUGHT PARTIALLY TO CONSENT TO THE SENDING OF HEPBURN BY HIS BROTHER'S PLEDGING HIMSELF THAT THE REAL NATURE OF PHILIP'S ERRAND SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO ANY HUMAN CREATURE SAVE THEM THREE AS ALL THIS WAS BEING REVEALED TO PHILIP HE SAT APPARENTLY UNMOVED AND SIMPLY ATTENTIVE
5339-14134-0014 IN FACT HE WAS GIVING ALL HIS MIND TO UNDERSTANDING THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE LEAVING HIS OWN FEELINGS IN THE BACKGROUND TILL HIS INTELLECT SHOULD HAVE DONE ITS WORK HE SAID LITTLE BUT WHAT HE DID SAY WAS TO THE POINT AND SATISFIED BOTH BROTHERS
5339-14134-0015 JOHN PERCEIVED THAT HIS MESSENGER WOULD EXERCISE PENETRATION AND ACT WITH ENERGY WHILE JEREMIAH WAS SOOTHED BY PHILIP'S CAUTION IN NOT HASTILY ADMITTING THE PROBABILITY OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST DICKINSON AND IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CONDUCT AND GOOD CHARACTER
5339-14134-0016 PHILIP HAD THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING HIMSELF EMPLOYED ON A MISSION WHICH WOULD CALL OUT HIS POWERS AND YET NOT EXCEED THEM IN HIS OWN MIND HE FORESTALLED THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS MASTERS AND WAS SILENTLY IN ADVANCE OF JOHN FOSTER'S PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS
5339-14134-0017 WHILE HE APPEARED TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WITH QUIET BUSINESS LIKE ATTENTION IT WAS SETTLED THAT THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY NORTHWARDS TO HARTLEPOOL WHENCE HE COULD EASILY PROCEED EITHER BY LAND OR SEA TO NEWCASTLE FROM WHICH PLACE SMACKS WERE CONSTANTLY SAILING TO LONDON
5339-14134-0018 SAYING IT WAS MORE THAN HE SHOULD REQUIRE BUT THEY REPEATED WITH FRESH URGENCY THEIR WARNINGS ABOUT THE TERRIBLE HIGH PRICES OF LONDON TILL HE COULD ONLY RESOLVE TO KEEP A STRICT ACCOUNT AND BRING BACK ALL THAT HE DID NOT EXPEND SINCE NOTHING BUT HIS TAKING THE WHOLE SUM WOULD SATISFY HIS EMPLOYERS
5339-14134-0019 THE LATTER WAS SILENT BROODING OVER THE CONFIDENCE WHICH PHILIP HAD APPARENTLY RECEIVED BUT WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM HE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THE CULMINATING POINT OF PHILIP'S PROPOSED JOURNEY TO LONDON
5339-14134-0020 THAT GREAT CITY OF LONDON WHICH FROM ITS VERY INACCESSIBILITY FIFTY YEARS AGO LOOMED SO MAGNIFICENT THROUGH THE MIST OF MEN'S IMAGINATIONS IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT PHILIP FELT EXULTANT AT THE MERE FACT OF GOING TO LONDON BUT THEN AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING SYLVIA
5339-14134-0021 OF NOT SEEING HER FOR A WEEK A FORTNIGHT NAY HE MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A MONTH FOR NO RASH HURRY WAS TO MAR HIS DELICATE NEGOTIATION GNAWED AT HIS HEART
5339-14134-0022 SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY AS HE PERCEIVED COULSON'S JEALOUS SULLENNESS
5339-14134-0023 AS THEY ALL SAT AT TEA IN ALICE ROSE'S HOUSE PLACE PHILIP ANNOUNCED HIS INTENDED JOURNEY
5339-14134-0024 TO LUNNON EXCLAIMED ALICE HESTER SAID NOTHING
5339-14134-0025 SAID COULSON LUCK SAID ALICE TURNING SHARP ROUND ON HIM NIVER LET ME HEAR SUCH A VAIN WORD OUT O THY MOUTH LADDIE AGAIN IT'S THE LORD'S DOING AND LUCK'S THE DEVIL'S WAY O PUTTING IT
5339-14134-0026 NIVER FRET THYSELF MOTHER ABOUT T SHIRT SAID PHILIP IF I NEED A SHIRT
5339-14134-0027 BUT IF THAT'S THE FRAME O MIND THOU'RT IN LUNNON IS LIKE FOR TO BE A SORE PLACE O TEMPTATION THERE'S PITFALLS FOR MEN AND TRAPS FOR MONEY AT IVERY TURN AS I'VE HEERD SAY
5339-14134-0028 SAID COULSON HE'S SENT FOR
5339-14134-0029 PHILIP KNOWS SAID HESTER AND THEN SOMEHOW HER VOICE FAILED HER AND SHE STOPPED PHILIP PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS HALF UTTERED SENTENCE HE WAS EAGER TO TELL COULSON AS FAR AS HE COULD DO SO WITHOUT BETRAYING HIS MASTER'S SECRET HOW MANY DRAWBACKS THERE WERE TO HIS PROPOSED JOURNEY
5339-14134-0030 IN THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IT INVOLVED AND HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE MONKSHAVEN HE SAID COULSON I'D GIVE A DEAL IT WERE THOU THAT WERE GOING AND NOT ME AT LEAST THERE IS MANY A TIME I'D GIVE A DEAL
5339-14134-0031 I'LL NOT DENY BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'M PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT ON'T BUT IF I COULD I'D CHANGE PLACES WI THEE AT THIS MOMENT IT'S FINE TALKING SAID COULSON HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET NOT CARING TO SHOW IT I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WERE AN EVEN CHANCE BETWIXT US TWO AT FIRST
5339-14134-0032 SHE WAS PLAYING WITH HER TEASPOON BUT HE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS CHOKING DOWN HER TEARS
5339-14134-0033 WHAT'S TO DO HESTER SAID HE SHE LIFTED UP THOSE EYES USUALLY SO SOFT AND SERENE NOW THEY WERE FULL OF THE LIGHT OF INDIGNATION SHINING THROUGH TEARS TO DO SHE SAID COULSON I'D THOUGHT BETTER OF THEE
5339-14134-0034 GOING AND DOUBTING AND ENVYING PHILIP AS NIVER DID THEE AN ILL TURN OR SAID AN ILL WORD OR THOUGHT AN ILL THOUGHT BY THEE AND SENDING HIM AWAY OUT O T HOUSE THIS LAST NIGHT OF ALL
5339-14134-0035 SHE HASTILY GOT UP AND LEFT THE ROOM
5339-14134-0036 AND YET HE WAS REPROACHED FOR THE COURSE IT WAS TAKING
5339-14134-0037 AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
5339-14134-0038 AND ALL THE MODIFICATION ON THIS POINT WHICH HIS JUDGMENT COULD OBTAIN FROM HIS IMPETUOUS AND EXCITED HEART WAS THAT HE WOULD WATCH HER WORDS AND MANNER WELL WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING ABSENCE AND IF IN THEM HE READ THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF TENDER REGRETFUL FEELING
5339-14134-0039 HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS LOVE AT HER FEET NOT EVEN URGING THE YOUNG GIRL TO MAKE ANY RETURN OR TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HOPED THE GERM WAS ALREADY BUDDING IN HER HE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH HER HE COULD NOT BE PATIENT HIMSELF
5339-14134-0040 THEY HAD SEEN HIM ALREADY OR HIS IMPULSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DODGE BEHIND THE WALL AND AVOID THEM EVEN THOUGH ONE OF HIS PURPOSES IN GOING TO HAYTERSBANK HAD BEEN TO BID HIS UNCLE FAREWELL KINRAID TOOK HIM BY SURPRISE FROM THE HEARTY GREETING HE GAVE HIM
5339-14134-0041 AND CONVINCED OF HER GREAT LOVE TOWARDS HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN ANY PREVIOUS JEALOUSY OF PHILIP SECURE AND EXULTANT HIS BROAD HANDSOME WEATHER BRONZED FACE WAS AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO PHILIP'S LONG THOUGHTFUL SALLOW COUNTENANCE
5339-14134-0042 HE TOLD HIS UNCLE THAT HE WAS BOUND FOR LONDON THE NEXT DAY ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE FOSTERS DANIEL WAS DEEPLY STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS TALKING TO A MAN SETTING OFF FOR LONDON AT A DAY'S NOTICE
5339-14134-0043 NAY SAID PHILIP I KNEW NOUGHT ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT IT'S NONE O MY DOING GOING FOR I'D LIEFER HA STAYED WHERE I AM YO'LL LIKE IT WHEN ONCE YO'RE THERE
5339-14134-0044 NO I SHAN'T HE REPLIED SHORTLY LIKING HAS NOUGHT TO DO WITH IT AH YO KNEW NOUGHT ABOUT IT LAST NEET CONTINUED DANIEL MUSINGLY
5339-14134-0045 BEFORE GOING TO SEA SAID PHILIP HALF SMILING NA
5339-14134-0046 THOUGH OUR SHIP LAY A FORTNEET OFF GRAVESEND KINRAID NOW SEEMED IN A HURRY BUT PHILIP WAS STUNG WITH CURIOSITY TO ASCERTAIN HIS MOVEMENTS AND SUDDENLY ADDRESSED HIM I HEARD YO WERE THESE PARTS
5339-14134-0047 AND SAIL FOR THE NORTH SEAS DAY AFTER HE TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN TO WHISTLE AS IF HE DID NOT WISH FOR ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIS INTERROGATOR PHILIP INDEED HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO HIM HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW I'D LIKE TO BID GOOD BY TO SYLVIE IS SHE AT HOME HE ASKED OF HER FATHER
5339-14134-0048 SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
5339-14134-0049 GEARIN AND A AN FOLK IS TALKIN ON A NEW KIND O MAK AND IF THOU'S BOUND FOR YORK I'M NOT GOING BY YORK I'M GOING BY A NEWCASTLE SMACK NEWCASSEL
5339-14134-0050 CAN GIVE ALL REQUISITE INFORMATION AY AY SAID ROBSON
5339-14134-0051 I'LL RECKON TO HEAR FRO THEE IN A WEEK OR MAYHAP LESS
5339-14134-0052 BRUNTON SELLS CHEESE AND THAT'S NO BETTER PHILIP PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST AND TO WRITE WORD TO ROBSON WHO SATISFIED WITH HIS WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION BADE HIM GO ON AND SEE IF HE COULD NOT FIND THE LASS
5339-14134-0053 AND SHE HAD COVERTLY WATCHED THEM UP THE BROW IN THE FIELD SHE SATE DOWN TO MEDITATE AND DREAM ABOUT HER GREAT HAPPINESS IN BEING BELOVED BY HER HERO CHARLEY KINRAID NO GLOOMY DREAD OF HIS LONG SUMMER'S ABSENCE NO FEAR OF THE COLD
5339-14134-0054 GLITTERING ICEBERGS BEARING MERCILESSLY DOWN ON THE URANIA NOR SHUDDERING ANTICIPATION OF THE DARK WAVES OF EVIL IMPORT CROSSED HER MIND HE LOVED HER AND THAT WAS ENOUGH HER EYES LOOKED TRANCE LIKE INTO A DIM GLORIOUS FUTURE OF LIFE
5339-14134-0055 HER LIPS STILL WARM AND REDDENED BY HIS KISS WERE JUST PARTED IN A HAPPY SMILE WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING FOOTSTEP A FOOTSTEP QUITE FAMILIAR ENOUGH FOR HER TO RECOGNIZE IT AND WHICH WAS UNWELCOME NOW
5339-14134-0056 AS DISTURBING HER IN THE ONE BLESSED SUBJECT OF THOUGHT IN WHICH ALONE SHE CARED TO INDULGE WELL PHILIP AN WHAT BRINGS HERE WAS HER RATHER UNGRACIOUS GREETING WHY SYLVIE ARE YO SORRY TO SEE ME
5339-14134-0057 BUT SHE TURNED IT OFF WITH ASSUMED LIGHTNESS OH YES
5339-14134-0058 PENITENTLY AS IF ANXIOUS TO BE FORGIVEN SYLVIA DID NOT WANT HIS PENITENCE DID NOT CARE FOR HER RIBBON WAS TROUBLED BY HIS EARNESTNESS OF MANNER BUT HE KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE ONLY KNEW
5339-14134-0059 THAT SHE WHOM HE LOVED HAD ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND HE HAD NEGLECTED IT SO ANXIOUS TO BE EXCUSED AND FORGIVEN HE WENT ON WITH THE APOLOGY SHE CARED NOT TO HEAR IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS OCCUPIED WITH HER OWN AFFAIRS LESS ENGROSSED WITH DEEP FEELING
5339-14134-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE REPROACHED HIM IF ONLY IN JEST FOR HIS CARELESSNESS AS IT WAS SHE SCARCELY TOOK IN THE SENSE OF HIS WORDS
5339-14134-0061 HE PAUSED A LITTLE SYLVIA'S GALLOPING THOUGHTS WERE PULLED SUDDENLY UP BY HIS SILENCE SHE FELT THAT HE WANTED HER TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BESIDES AN AMBIGUOUS WELL
5339-14134-0062 ALMOST AS IF BESEECHING HER TO SHOW OR EXPRESS SOME SORROW AT A JOURNEY THE VERY DESTINATION OF WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME TO LUNNON
5339-14134-0063 NOTHING MORE AS PHILIP'S INSTINCT TOLD HIM BUT HE REASONED THAT FIRST CORRECT IMPRESSION AWAY WITH INGENIOUS SOPHISTRY NOT TO LIVE THERE ONLY TO STAY FOR SOME TIME
5339-14134-0064 SUDDENLY A LIGHT SHONE DOWN INTO PHILIP'S MIND HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED AS HE SPOKE NEXT
5339-14134-0065 SHE STOOPED FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED AND CAME UP RED AS A ROSE TO BE SURE WHAT THEN AND SHE EYED HIM DEFIANTLY THOUGH IN HER HEART SHE TREMBLED SHE KNEW NOT WHY WHAT THEN
5339-14134-0066 THAT THE HALF OF SOME SILVER COIN WAS AMONG THE CONTENTS THUS TURNED OVER BEFORE THE BOX WAS LOCKED BUT THY MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT SYLVIE HE'S PLAYED FALSE WI OTHER LASSES HE'LL BE PLAYING THEE FALSE SOME O THESE DAYS IF THOU LETS HIM COME ABOUT THEE
5339-14134-0067 IT WERE WILLIE COULSON AS TELLED ME AS SOLEMN AND SERIOUS AS ONE MAN CAN SPEAK TO ANOTHER
5339-14134-0068 SAID SYLVIA SHIVERING ALL OVER WITH PASSION
5339-14134-0069 IT WERE YO'R OWN MOTHER SYLVIA AS KNOWED YO HAD NO BROTHER OR ANY ONE TO SEE AFTER YO AND YO SO PRETTY SO PRETTY SYLVIA HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD SADLY THAT MEN RUN AFTER YO AGAINST THEIR WILL AS ONE MAY SAY

5339-14134-0073 AT LENGTH HE RAISED HIS STIFFENED BODY AND STOOD UP DIZZY UP THE LITTLE WOODEN STAIRS HE WENT WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE TO THE SMALL SQUARE LANDING ALMOST FILLED UP WITH THE GREAT CHEST FOR OAT CAKE HE BREATHED HARD FOR A MINUTE AND THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF SYLVIA'S ROOM
5339-14134-0074 SYLVIE I'M GOING AWAY SAY GOOD BY NO ANSWER NOT A SOUND HEARD SYLVIE A LITTLE LOUDER AND LESS HOARSELY SPOKEN THERE WAS NO REPLY SYLVIE

5339-14134-0077 THE NEED FOR HIS DEPARTURE AND YET HE STOOD STILL FOR A LITTLE TIME LIKE ONE ENTRANCED AS IF HIS WILL HAD LOST ALL POWER TO COMPEL HIM TO LEAVE THE PLACE THOSE TWO WORDS OF HERS WHICH TWO HOURS BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FAR BENEATH HIS ASPIRATIONS
5339-14134-0078 AND TOUCHED HER PRIDE MAYBE TOO
5339-14134-0079 AND I'LL BE HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS IVER I CAN IN HALF A YEAR SUCH AS HE FORGETS IF IVER HE'S THOUGHT SERIOUS ABOUT HER BUT IN A MY LIFETIME IF I LIVE TO FOURSCORE I CAN NIVER FORGET
2764-36619-0000 CHAPTER FIVE AT RANDOM FOR SOME WHILE THE VOYAGE OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS MARKED BY NO INCIDENT BUT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AROSE THAT DISPLAYED NED LAND'S MARVELOUS SKILLS AND SHOWED JUST HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE WE COULD PLACE IN HIM
2764-36619-0001 OFF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH THE FRIGATE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A FLEET OF AMERICAN WHALERS AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY HADN'T SEEN THE NARWHALE BUT ONE OF THEM THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONROE
2764-36619-0002 ANXIOUS TO SEE NED LAND AT WORK COMMANDER FARRAGUT AUTHORIZED HIM TO MAKE HIS WAY ABOARD THE MONROE AND THE CANADIAN HAD SUCH GOOD LUCK THAT WITH A RIGHT AND LEFT SHOT HE HARPOONED NOT ONE WHALE BUT TWO STRIKING THE FIRST STRAIGHT TO THE HEART AND CATCHING THE OTHER AFTER A FEW MINUTES CHASE
2764-36619-0003 ASSUREDLY IF THE MONSTER EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH NED LAND'S HARPOON I WOULDN'T BET ON THE MONSTER THE FRIGATE SAILED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED BY JULY THIRD WE WERE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN ABREAST OF CABO DE LAS VIRGENES
2764-36619-0004 AND MANEUVERED INSTEAD TO DOUBLE CAPE HORN THE CREW SIDED WITH HIM UNANIMOUSLY INDEED WERE WE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER THE NARWHALE IN SUCH A CRAMPED STRAIT MANY OF OUR SAILORS SWORE THAT THE MONSTER COULDN'T NEGOTIATE THIS PASSAGEWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE'S TOO BIG FOR IT
2764-36619-0005 NEAR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ON JULY SIXTH FIFTEEN MILES SOUTH OF SHORE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN DOUBLED THAT SOLITARY ISLET AT THE TIP OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT THAT STRAY ROCK DUTCH SEAMEN HAD NAMED CAPE HORN AFTER THEIR HOMETOWN OF HOORN
2764-36619-0006 OUR COURSE WAS SET FOR THE NORTHWEST AND THE NEXT DAY OUR FRIGATE'S PROPELLER FINALLY CHURNED THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OPEN YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR EYES REPEATED THE SAILORS OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THEY OPENED AMAZINGLY WIDE EYES AND SPYGLASSES
2764-36619-0007 A BIT DAZZLED IT IS TRUE BY THE VISTA OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS DIDN'T REMAIN AT REST FOR AN INSTANT DAY AND NIGHT WE OBSERVED THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND THOSE WITH NYCTALOPIC EYES WHOSE ABILITY TO SEE IN THE DARK INCREASED THEIR CHANCES BY FIFTY PERCENT
2764-36619-0008 I NO LONGER LEFT THE SHIP'S DECK SOMETIMES BENDING OVER THE FORECASTLE RAILINGS SOMETIMES LEANING AGAINST THE STERNRAIL
2764-36619-0009 AND HOW MANY TIMES I SHARED THE EXCITEMENT OF GENERAL STAFF AND CREW WHEN SOME UNPREDICTABLE WHALE LIFTED ITS BLACKISH BACK ABOVE THE WAVES IN AN INSTANT THE FRIGATE'S DECK WOULD BECOME DENSELY POPULATED THE COWLS OVER THE COMPANIONWAYS WOULD VOMIT A TORRENT OF SAILORS AND OFFICERS
2764-36619-0010 WITH PANTING CHESTS AND ANXIOUS EYES WE EACH WOULD OBSERVE THE CETACEAN'S MOVEMENTS I STARED I STARED UNTIL I NEARLY WENT BLIND FROM A WORN OUT RETINA WHILE CONSEIL AS STOIC AS EVER KEPT REPEATING TO ME IN A CALM TONE
2764-36619-0011 IF MASTER'S EYES WOULD KINDLY STOP BULGING MASTER WILL SEE FARTHER BUT WHAT A WASTE OF ENERGY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHANGE COURSE AND RACE AFTER THE ANIMAL SIGHTED ONLY TO FIND AN ORDINARY BALEEN WHALE
2764-36619-0012 OR A COMMON SPERM WHALE THAT SOON DISAPPEARED AMID A CHORUS OF CURSES HOWEVER THE WEATHER HELD GOOD OUR VOYAGE WAS PROCEEDING UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS BY THEN IT WAS THE BAD SEASON IN THESE SOUTHERNMOST REGIONS
2764-36619-0013 BECAUSE JULY IN THIS ZONE CORRESPONDS TO OUR JANUARY IN EUROPE BUT THE SEA REMAINED SMOOTH AND EASILY VISIBLE OVER A VAST PERIMETER NED LAND STILL KEPT UP THE MOST TENACIOUS SKEPTICISM
2764-36619-0014 BUT THIS STUBBORN CANADIAN SPENT EIGHT HOURS OUT OF EVERY TWELVE READING OR SLEEPING IN HIS CABIN A HUNDRED TIMES I CHIDED HIM FOR HIS UNCONCERN BAH HE REPLIED NOTHING'S OUT THERE PROFESSOR ARONNAX
2764-36619-0015 AND IF THERE IS SOME ANIMAL WHAT CHANCE WOULD WE HAVE OF SPOTTING IT CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE JUST WANDERING AROUND AT RANDOM PEOPLE SAY THEY'VE SIGHTED THIS SLIPPERY BEAST AGAIN IN THE PACIFIC HIGH SEAS I'M TRULY WILLING TO BELIEVE IT BUT TWO MONTHS HAVE ALREADY GONE BY SINCE THEN
2764-36619-0016 AND JUDGING BY YOUR NARWHALE'S PERSONALITY IT HATES GROWING MOLDY FROM HANGING OUT TOO LONG IN THE SAME WATERWAYS IT'S BLESSED WITH A TERRIFIC GIFT FOR GETTING AROUND NOW PROFESSOR YOU KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I THAT NATURE DOESN'T VIOLATE GOOD SENSE
2764-36619-0017 THESE BEARINGS DETERMINED THE FRIGATE TOOK A MORE DECISIVE WESTWARD HEADING AND TACKLED THE SEAS OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC COMMANDER FARRAGUT FELT AND WITH GOOD REASON THAT IT WAS BEST TO STAY IN DEEP WATERS AND KEEP HIS DISTANCE FROM CONTINENTS OR ISLANDS
2764-36619-0018 NO DOUBT OUR BOSUN SAID BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WATER FOR HIM
2764-36619-0019 THEN CUT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO DEGREES AND HEADED FOR THE SEAS OF CHINA WE WERE FINALLY IN THE AREA OF THE MONSTER'S LATEST ANTICS AND IN ALL HONESTY SHIPBOARD CONDITIONS BECAME LIFE THREATENING HEARTS WERE POUNDING HIDEOUSLY
2764-36619-0020 NOBODY ATE NOBODY SLEPT TWENTY TIMES A DAY SOME ERROR IN PERCEPTION OR THE OPTICAL ILLUSIONS OF SOME SAILOR PERCHED IN THE CROSSTREES WOULD CAUSE INTOLERABLE ANGUISH AND THIS EMOTION REPEATED TWENTY TIMES OVER
2764-36619-0021 KEPT US IN A STATE OF IRRITABILITY SO INTENSE THAT A REACTION WAS BOUND TO FOLLOW AND THIS REACTION WASN'T LONG IN COMING FOR THREE MONTHS DURING WHICH EACH DAY SEEMED LIKE A CENTURY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PLOWED ALL THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC
2764-36619-0022 RACING AFTER WHALES SIGHTED ABRUPTLY VEERING OFF COURSE SWERVING SHARPLY FROM ONE TACK TO ANOTHER STOPPING SUDDENLY PUTTING ON STEAM AND REVERSING ENGINES IN QUICK SUCCESSION AT THE RISK OF STRIPPING ITS GEARS
2764-36619-0023 AND IT DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT UNEXPLORED FROM THE BEACHES OF JAPAN TO THE COASTS OF AMERICA AND WE FOUND NOTHING NOTHING EXCEPT AN IMMENSENESS OF DESERTED WAVES NOTHING REMOTELY RESEMBLING A GIGANTIC NARWHALE OR AN UNDERWATER ISLET
2764-36619-0024 AND EACH MAN NOW WANTED ONLY TO CATCH UP ON HIS EATING AND SLEEPING TO MAKE UP FOR THE TIME HE HAD SO STUPIDLY SACRIFICED WITH TYPICAL HUMAN FICKLENESS THEY JUMPED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER INEVITABLY THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS OF THE UNDERTAKING BECAME ITS MOST ENERGETIC OPPONENTS
2764-36619-0025 THIS REACTION MOUNTED UPWARD FROM THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FROM THE QUARTERS OF THE BUNKER HANDS TO THE MESSROOM OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND FOR CERTAIN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT'S CHARACTERISTIC STUBBORNNESS THE FRIGATE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PUT BACK TO THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH
2764-36619-0026 NEVER HAD THE CREW OF AN AMERICAN NAVAL CRAFT SHOWN MORE PATIENCE AND ZEAL
2764-36619-0027 A REQUEST TO THIS EFFECT WAS PRESENTED TO THE COMMANDER THE COMMANDER STOOD HIS GROUND HIS SAILORS COULDN'T HIDE THEIR DISCONTENT AND THEIR WORK SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT I'M UNWILLING TO SAY THAT THERE WAS MUTINY ON BOARD
2764-36619-0028 AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHART A COURSE TOWARD EUROPEAN SEAS THIS PROMISE WAS GIVEN ON NOVEMBER SECOND IT HAD THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF REVIVING THE CREW'S FAILING SPIRITS THE OCEAN WAS OBSERVED WITH RENEWED CARE
2764-36619-0029 EACH MAN WANTED ONE LAST LOOK WITH WHICH TO SUM UP HIS EXPERIENCE SPYGLASSES FUNCTIONED WITH FEVERISH ENERGY A SUPREME CHALLENGE HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THE GIANT NARWHALE AND THE LATTER HAD NO ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR IGNORING THIS SUMMONS TO APPEAR
2764-36619-0030 TWO DAYS PASSED THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN STAYED AT HALF STEAM
2764-36619-0031 A THOUSAND METHODS WERE USED TO SPARK ITS INTEREST OR ROUSE IT FROM ITS APATHY ENORMOUS SIDES OF BACON WERE TRAILED IN OUR WAKE TO THE GREAT SATISFACTION I MUST SAY OF ASSORTED SHARKS
2764-36619-0032 WHILE THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN HEAVED TO ITS LONGBOATS RADIATED IN EVERY DIRECTION AROUND IT AND DIDN'T LEAVE A SINGLE POINT OF THE SEA UNEXPLORED BUT THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER FOURTH ARRIVED WITH THIS UNDERWATER MYSTERY STILL UNSOLVED
2764-36619-0033 BY THEN THE FRIGATE LAY IN LATITUDE THIRTY ONE DEGREES FIFTEEN NORTH AND LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX DEGREES FORTY TWO EAST THE SHORES OF JAPAN WERE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED MILES TO OUR LEEWARD NIGHT WAS COMING ON EIGHT O'CLOCK HAD JUST STRUCK
2764-36619-0034 HUGE CLOUDS COVERED THE MOON'S DISK THEN IN ITS FIRST QUARTER THE SEA UNDULATED PLACIDLY BENEATH THE FRIGATE'S STEMPOST JUST THEN I WAS IN THE BOW LEANING OVER THE STARBOARD RAIL CONSEIL STATIONED BESIDE ME STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD
2764-36619-0035 ROOSTING IN THE SHROUDS THE CREW EXAMINED THE HORIZON WHICH SHRANK AND DARKENED LITTLE BY LITTLE OFFICERS WERE PROBING THE INCREASING GLOOM WITH THEIR NIGHT GLASSES SOMETIMES THE MURKY OCEAN SPARKLED BENEATH MOONBEAMS THAT DARTED BETWEEN THE FRINGES OF TWO CLOUDS
2764-36619-0036 THEN ALL TRACES OF LIGHT VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS OBSERVING CONSEIL I DISCOVERED THAT JUST BARELY THE GALLANT LAD HAD FALLEN UNDER THE GENERAL INFLUENCE AT LEAST SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS NERVES WERE TWITCHING WITH CURIOSITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY
2764-36619-0037 COME ON CONSEIL I TOLD HIM HERE'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO POCKET THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF MASTER WILL PERMIT MY SAYING SO CONSEIL REPLIED I NEVER EXPECTED TO WIN THAT PRIZE
2764-36619-0038 IN MASTER'S LITTLE APARTMENT CONSEIL ANSWERED IN MASTER'S MUSEUM
2764-36619-0039 AND IT WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED EVERY CURIOSITY SEEKER IN TOWN QUITE SO CONSEIL AND WHAT'S MORE
2764-36619-0040 TO BE SURE CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY I DO THINK THEY'LL HAVE FUN AT MASTER'S EXPENSE AND MUST IT BE SAID IT MUST BE SAID CONSEIL WELL THEN IT WILL SERVE MASTER RIGHT
2764-36619-0041 HOW TRUE WHEN ONE HAS THE HONOR OF BEING AN EXPERT AS MASTER IS ONE MUSTN'T LAY HIMSELF OPEN TO CONSEIL DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO COMPLETE THE COMPLIMENT IN THE MIDST OF THE GENERAL SILENCE A VOICE BECAME AUDIBLE
2764-36617-0000 CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER
2764-36617-0001 I UNDERSTOOD AT LAST THAT MY TRUE VOCATION MY SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE WAS TO HUNT DOWN THIS DISTURBING MONSTER AND RID THE WORLD OF IT EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
2764-36617-0002 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS BUT NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND WITHOUT ANOTHER THOUGHT OF EXHAUSTION FRIENDS OR COLLECTIONS
2764-36617-0003 I ACCEPTED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFER BESIDES I MUSED ALL ROADS LEAD HOME TO EUROPE AND OUR UNICORN MAY BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE ME TOWARD THE COAST OF FRANCE THAT FINE ANIMAL MAY EVEN LET ITSELF BE CAPTURED IN EUROPEAN SEAS AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO ME
2764-36617-0004 CONSEIL I CALLED IN AN IMPATIENT VOICE CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT A DEVOTED LAD WHO WENT WITH ME ON ALL MY JOURNEYS A GALLANT FLEMISH BOY WHOM I GENUINELY LIKED AND WHO RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT A BORN STOIC PUNCTILIOUS ON PRINCIPLE
2764-36617-0005 HABITUALLY HARDWORKING RARELY STARTLED BY LIFE'S SURPRISES VERY SKILLFUL WITH HIS HANDS EFFICIENT IN HIS EVERY DUTY AND DESPITE HIS HAVING A NAME THAT MEANS COUNSEL NEVER GIVING ADVICE NOT EVEN THE UNSOLICITED KIND
2764-36617-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO IN CONSEIL I HAD A SEASONED SPECIALIST IN BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION AN ENTHUSIAST WHO COULD RUN WITH ACROBATIC AGILITY
2764-36617-0007 UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE LADDER OF BRANCHES GROUPS CLASSES SUBCLASSES ORDERS FAMILIES GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES AND VARIETIES BUT THERE HIS SCIENCE CAME TO A HALT CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2764-36617-0008 WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
2764-36617-0009 FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS CONSEIL HAD GONE WITH ME WHEREVER SCIENCE BECKONED NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF A JOURNEY NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO
2764-36617-0010 NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT MOREOVER HE ENJOYED EXCELLENT HEALTH THAT DEFIED ALL AILMENTS OWNED SOLID MUSCLES BUT HADN'T A NERVE IN HIM NOT A SIGN OF NERVES THE MENTAL TYPE I MEAN
2764-36617-0011 THE LAD WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD AND HIS AGE TO THAT OF HIS EMPLOYER WAS AS FIFTEEN IS TO TWENTY PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING I HAD TURNED FORTY BUT CONSEIL HAD ONE FLAW HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY
2764-36617-0012 AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME CONSEIL I REPEATED WHILE FEVERISHLY BEGINNING MY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE TO BE SURE I HAD CONFIDENCE IN THIS DEVOTED LAD
2764-36617-0013 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
2764-36617-0014 CONSEIL I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONSEIL APPEARED
2764-36617-0015 YES MY BOY GET MY THINGS READY GET YOURS READY WE'RE DEPARTING IN TWO HOURS AS MASTER WISHES CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY WE HAVEN'T A MOMENT TO LOSE PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS
2764-36617-0016 DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY WHAT ABOUT MASTER'S COLLECTIONS CONSEIL VENTURED TO OBSERVE WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER WHAT THE ARCHAEOTHERIUM HYRACOTHERIUM OREODONTS CHEIROPOTAMUS AND MASTER'S OTHER FOSSIL SKELETONS
2764-36617-0017 CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR WHATEVER DETOUR MASTER WISHES OH IT'S NOTHING REALLY A ROUTE SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
2764-36617-0018 AS MASTER THINKS BEST CONSEIL REPLIED PLACIDLY YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE WE'RE GOING TO RID THE SEAS OF IT THE AUTHOR OF A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ON THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
2764-36617-0019 IT'S A GLORIOUS MISSION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE
2764-36617-0020 THESE BEASTS CAN BE QUITE UNPREDICTABLE BUT WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHO'S GAME FOR ANYTHING WHAT MASTER DOES I'LL DO CONSEIL REPLIED
2764-36617-0021 AS MASTER WISHES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER OUR TRUNKS WERE READY CONSEIL DID THEM IN A FLASH AND I WAS SURE THE LAD HADN'T MISSED A THING BECAUSE HE CLASSIFIED SHIRTS AND SUITS AS EXPERTLY AS BIRDS AND MAMMALS
2764-36617-0022 THE HOTEL ELEVATOR DROPPED US OFF IN THE MAIN VESTIBULE ON THE MEZZANINE I WENT DOWN A SHORT STAIR LEADING TO THE GROUND FLOOR
2764-36617-0023 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
2764-36617-0024 FOR A FARE OF TWENTY FRANCS THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN BROADWAY TO UNION SQUARE
2764-36617-0025 THAT GREAT NEW YORK ANNEX LOCATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE EAST RIVER AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE ARRIVED AT THE WHARF NEXT TO WHICH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS VOMITING TORRENTS OF BLACK SMOKE FROM ITS TWO FUNNELS OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE
2764-36617-0026 I RUSHED ABOARD I ASKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME PROFESSOR PIERRE ARONNAX HE SAID TO ME
2764-36617-0027 THE SAME I REPLIED COMMANDER FARRAGUT IN PERSON WELCOME ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU I BOWED AND LETTING THE COMMANDER ATTEND TO GETTING UNDER WAY I WAS TAKEN TO THE CABIN THAT HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR ME
2764-36617-0028 THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN REACHED AN AVERAGE SPEED OF EIGHTEEN POINT THREE MILES PER HOUR A CONSIDERABLE SPEED BUT STILL NOT ENOUGH TO COPE WITH OUR GIGANTIC CETACEAN THE FRIGATE'S INTERIOR ACCOMMODATIONS COMPLEMENTED ITS NAUTICAL VIRTUES I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN
2764-36617-0029 WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD CONSEIL WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED AS COMFORTABLE AS A HERMIT CRAB INSIDE THE SHELL OF A WHELK
2764-36617-0030 JUST THEN COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS GIVING ORDERS TO CAST OFF THE LAST MOORINGS HOLDING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO ITS BROOKLYN PIER AND SO IF I'D BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS
2764-36617-0031 THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM BUT COMMANDER FARRAGUT DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE A SINGLE DAY
2764-36617-0032 AT THIS ORDER WHICH WAS RELAYED TO THE ENGINE BY MEANS OF A COMPRESSED AIR DEVICE THE MECHANICS ACTIVATED THE START UP WHEEL STEAM RUSHED WHISTLING INTO THE GAPING VALVES LONG HORIZONTAL PISTONS GROANED AND PUSHED THE TIE RODS OF THE DRIVE SHAFT
2764-36617-0033 THE BLADES OF THE PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES WITH INCREASING SPEED AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN MOVED OUT MAJESTICALLY AMID A SPECTATOR LADEN ESCORT OF SOME ONE HUNDRED FERRIES AND TENDERS AUTHOR'S NOTE TENDERS ARE SMALL STEAMBOATS THAT ASSIST THE BIG LINERS
2764-36617-0034 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
2764-36617-0035 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
2764-36617-0036 THE WONDERFUL RIGHT BANK OF THIS RIVER ALL LOADED DOWN WITH COUNTRY HOMES AND PASSED BY THE FORTS TO SALUTES FROM THEIR BIGGEST CANNONS
2764-36617-0037 WHOSE THIRTY NINE STARS GLEAMED FROM THE GAFF OF THE MIZZEN SAIL
2764-36617-0038 IT HUGGED THIS SAND COVERED STRIP OF LAND WHERE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS ACCLAIMED US ONE MORE TIME THE ESCORT OF BOATS AND TENDERS STILL FOLLOWED THE FRIGATE AND ONLY LEFT US WHEN WE CAME ABREAST OF THE LIGHTSHIP WHOSE TWO SIGNAL LIGHTS MARK THE ENTRANCE OF THE NARROWS TO UPPER NEW YORK BAY
8580-287364-0000 CHAPTER TEN DROPPING THE STOWAWAY TOM'S EXCITED ANNOUNCEMENT STARTLED MISTER DAMON AND THE OTHERS AS MUCH AS IF THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD INFORMED THEM THAT THE AIRSHIP HAD EXPLODED
8580-287364-0001 AND WAS ABOUT TO DASH WITH THEM TO THE EARTH THE MEN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND STARED AT THE LAD A STOWAWAY ON BOARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL HOW DID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT ASKED MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0002 DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0003 WE MUST GET HIM OUT AT ONCE DECLARED MISTER JENKS I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS VOYAGE CAME FROM MISTER PARKER I PREDICTED IT FROM THE FIRST TOM THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE
8580-287364-0004 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THE SCIENTIST JUST THEN ANOTHER COMMUNICATION WAS COMING TO HIM BY WIRELESS HE LISTENED INTENTLY FATHER SAYS THE LAD TOLD HIS COMPANIONS THAT ERADICATE ONLY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN AT THE LAST MOMENT
8580-287364-0005 HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
8580-287364-0006 DECIDED MISTER JENKS WITH VIGOR GET HIM OUT AND DROP HIM OVERBOARD DROP HIM OVERBOARD CRIED MISTER PARKER IN HORROR NOT EXACTLY BUT GET RID OF HIM
8580-287364-0007 THAT MAN IS ONE OF MY ENEMIES HE HAS BEEN SENT BY THE BAND OF DIAMOND MAKERS HIDDEN AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO SPY ON ME AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT ME FROM SEEKING TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET
8580-287364-0008 HE TRIED TO WORK ON TOM'S SWIFT'S FEARS AND FRIGHTEN HIM FROM USING HIS AIRSHIP ON THIS QUEST THEN WHEN HE FAILED THE MAN MUST HAVE SNEAKED INTO THE SHED AND HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE SHIP WE MUST GET RID OF HIM OR HE MAY WRECK THE RED CLOUD
8580-287364-0009 THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
8580-287364-0010 THE YOUNG INVENTOR TRANSLATED THE DOTS AND DASHES BLESS MY POWDER HORN EXPLODED MISTER DAMON WE SHALL HAVE TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY THEN SPOKE MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0011 IF HE IS LIKE ANY OTHERS IN THE GANG HE IS A DESPERATE MAN BETTER SNEAK UP ON HIM THEN IF WE CAN PROPOSED MISTER PARKER THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO COPE WITH ONE MAN EVEN IF HE IS ARMED
8580-287364-0012 HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
8580-287364-0013 BECAUSE A STRAY BULLET MIGHT PIERCE THE GAS BAG AND DAMAGE THE SHIP THAT'S SO AGREED MISTER JENKS WELL I GUESS IF WE GO AT IT THE RIGHT WAY WE CAN CAPTURE HIM WITHOUT ANY SHOOTING BUT WE MUST TALK MORE QUIETLY
8580-287364-0014 HE MAY HAVE HEARD US I DON'T THINK SO REPLIED TOM THE STOREROOM IS FAR ENOUGH OFF SO THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR US BESIDES THE MOTOR MAKES SUCH A RACKET THAT HE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EVEN IF HE HEARD OUR VOICES
8580-287364-0015 SO UNLESS HE HEARD THE WIRELESS WORKING AND SUSPECTS SOMETHING FROM THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE ABOARD BUT WHY DO YOU THINK HE HAS REMAINED QUIET ALL THIS WHILE TOM ASKED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0016 PROBABLY HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL THE SHIP IS FARTHER OUT WEST SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS THEN HE WILL BE NEARER HIS FRIENDS AND CAN GET HELP IF HE NEEDS IT AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE WOULD DESTROY THE RED CLOUD ASKED MISTER PARKER
8580-287364-0017 I THINK THAT ALL HE IS WAITING FOR IS A FAVORABLE CHANCE DECLARED THE DIAMOND SEEKER HE WOULD DESTROY THE CRAFT AND US TOO IF HE COULD PREVENT US FROM DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN I BELIEVE
8580-287364-0018 THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0019 AND WHILE WE'RE ABOUT IT GIVE HIM A GOOD SCARE WHEN WE DO GET HIM SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS HOW ASKED TOM THREATEN TO DROP HIM OVERBOARD PERHAPS THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL HOW HE HAPPENED TO GET IN OUR SHIP
8580-287364-0020 AND WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE GANG OF DIAMOND MAKERS WE MAY GET VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT WAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN SCARE SUCH FELLOWS MUCH WAS TOM'S OPINION
8580-287364-0021 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CAPTURE HIM ASKED MISTER PARKER IF HE HAS A GUN IT WON'T BE ANY TOO EASY TO GO IN THE STOREROOM AND DRAG HIM OUT WE'LL HAVE TO USE A LITTLE STRATEGY DECIDED TOM AND THEN THEY DISCUSSED SEVERAL PLANS
8580-287364-0022 THE ONE FINALLY ADOPTED WAS THAT TOM AND MISTER DAMON SHOULD ENTER THE STOREROOM CASUALLY AS IF IN SEARCH OF FOOD TO COOK FOR SUPPER THEY WOULD DISCUSS VARIOUS DISHES AND MISTER DAMON WAS TO EXPRESS A PREFERENCE FOR SOMETHING IN THE FOOD LINE
8580-287364-0023 THE BOX CONTAINING WHICH WAS WELL BACK IN THE ROOM THIS WOULD GIVE THE TWO A CHANCE TO PENETRATE TO THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AROUSING THE SUSPICIONS OF THE HIDDEN MAN WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS SOON AS WE GET SIGHT OF HIM
8580-287364-0024 SAID TOM JUMP BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO USE HIS GUN MISTER JENKS AND MISTER PARKER WILL BE WAITING OUTSIDE THE ROOM TO CATCH HIM IF HE GETS AWAY FROM US I'LL HAVE SOME ROPES READY AND WE'LL TIE HIM UP AND WELL WE'LL DECIDE LATER WHAT TO DO WITH HIM ALL RIGHT
8580-287364-0025 I'M READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE TOM SAID THE ECCENTRIC MAN COME AHEAD THEY WENT SOFTLY TO THE STOREROOM AND LISTENED AT THE DOOR THERE WAS NO SOUND HEARD SAVE THAT MADE BY THE MACHINERY I WONDER IF HE'S REALLY HERE
8580-287364-0026 WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS
8580-287364-0027 I THINK I'D LIKE SOME OF THAT CANNED LOBSTER WITH FRENCH DRESSING ON SPOKE THE ECCENTRIC MAN THAT'S AWAY IN THE BACK END OF THE ROOM SAID TOM IN A LOUD VOICE IT'S UNDER A LOT OF BOXES
8580-287364-0028 THEN I'LL HELP YOU GET IT OUT BLESS MY FRYING PAN BUT I AM VERY FOND OF LOBSTER EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON IN AS NATURAL TONES AS WAS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
8580-287364-0029 HE AND TOM MOVED CAUTIOUSLY BACK AMONG THE BOXES AND BARRELS THEY WERE GLANCING ABOUT WITH EAGER EYES TOM SWITCHED ON AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE INSTANT HE DID SO
8580-287364-0030 HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW
8580-287364-0031 A MOMENT LATER THE YOUNG INVENTOR WAS BOWLED OVER AS A DARK FIGURE LEAPED OVER HIS HEAD CATCH HIM MISTER DAMON HE CRIED BLESS MY HATBAND I I MISTER DAMON'S VOICE ENDED IN A GRUNT HE TOO HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN BY THE FLEEING MAN
8580-287364-0032 LOOK OUT MISTER JENKS CRIED TOM TO WARN THOSE ON GUARD AT THE DOOR OF THE STOREROOM THERE WAS THE REPORT OF A GUN SOME EXCITED SHOUTS AND WHEN TOM COULD SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET AND RUSH OUT HE BEHELD MISTER PARKER CALMLY SITTING ON A STRUGGLING MAN
8580-287364-0033 WHILE MISTER JENKS HELD A GUN THAT WAS STILL SMOKING WE CAUGHT HIM CRIED THE SCIENTIST ANYBODY HURT ASKED TOM ANXIOUSLY NO I KNOCKED UP HIS GUN AS HE FIRED EXPLAINED MISTER JENKS WHERE ARE THE ROPES TOM
8580-287364-0034 THE CORDS WERE PRODUCED AND THE MAN WHO HAD NOW CEASED TO STRUGGLE WAS TIGHTLY BOUND HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT HE SMILED GRIMLY WHEN MISTER DAMON REMARKED I GUESS I'LL GO BACK IN THE STOREROOM TOM AND SEE HOW MUCH FOOD HE ATE
8580-287364-0035 HE WASN'T THERE LONG ENOUGH WELL FARLEY MUNSON SO IT'S YOU IS IT ASKED MISTER JENKS AS HE SURVEYED THE PRISONER DO YOU KNOW HIM ASKED TOM IN SOME SURPRISE

7367-86737-0045 YOU COULD NOT APPLY TO ANY ONE BETTER ABLE TO INFORM YOU ON ALL THESE POINTS FOR I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD AND ONE DAY THAT I FELL INTO HIS HANDS GOING FROM FERENTINO TO ALATRI HE FORTUNATELY FOR ME
7367-86737-0046 RECOLLECTED ME AND SET ME FREE NOT ONLY WITHOUT RANSOM BUT MADE ME A PRESENT OF A VERY SPLENDID WATCH AND RELATED HIS HISTORY TO ME LET US SEE THE WATCH SAID ALBERT
7367-86737-0047 BEARING THE NAME OF ITS MAKER OF PARISIAN MANUFACTURE AND A COUNT'S CORONET HERE IT IS SAID HE PESTE RETURNED ALBERT I COMPLIMENT YOU ON IT I HAVE ITS FELLOW HE TOOK HIS WATCH FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
7367-86737-0048 AND IT COST ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS LET US HEAR THE HISTORY SAID FRANZ MOTIONING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO SEAT HIMSELF
7367-86737-0049 AT THE MOMENT SIGNOR PASTRINI WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH THAT YOU KNEW LUIGI VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILD
7367-86737-0050 A YOUNG MAN HE IS ONLY TWO AND TWENTY HE WILL GAIN HIMSELF A REPUTATION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ALBERT AT TWO AND TWENTY TO BE THUS FAMOUS YES AND AT HIS AGE ALEXANDER CAESAR AND NAPOLEON
7367-86737-0051 HE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY
7367-86737-0052 ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD HE CAME TO THE CURATE OF PALESTRINA AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT TO READ IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR HE COULD NOT QUIT HIS FLOCK BUT THE GOOD CURATE WENT EVERY DAY TO SAY MASS AT A LITTLE HAMLET TOO POOR TO PAY A PRIEST AND WHICH
7367-86737-0053 EVERY DAY LUIGI LED HIS FLOCK TO GRAZE ON THE ROAD THAT LEADS FROM PALESTRINA TO BORGO EVERY DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND THE BOY SAT DOWN ON A BANK BY THE WAYSIDE
7367-86737-0054 AT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTH
7367-86737-0055 WITH THIS LUIGI PURCHASED BOOKS AND PENCILS HE APPLIED HIS IMITATIVE POWERS TO EVERYTHING AND LIKE GIOTTO WHEN YOUNG HE DREW ON HIS SLATE SHEEP HOUSES AND TREES
7367-86737-0056 IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
7367-86737-0057 HAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOK
7367-86737-0058 THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
7367-86737-0059 TERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
7367-86737-0060 THUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIRED
7367-86737-0061 AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
7367-86737-0062 AND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCK
7367-86737-0063 AND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCK
7367-86737-0064 SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
7367-86737-0065 THE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPON
7367-86737-0066 HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
7367-86737-0067 AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
7367-86737-0068 ONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARM
7367-86737-0069 THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
7367-86737-0070 AND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTION
7367-86737-0071 THEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATION
7367-86737-0072 TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
7367-86737-0073 THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0074 DRIVEN OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON A REGULAR WAR HAD CROSSED THE GARIGLIANO LIKE MANFRED AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE BANKS OF THE AMASINE BETWEEN SONNINO AND JUPERNO
7367-86737-0075 HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
7367-86737-0076 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
7367-86737-0077 THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF FEROCIOUS DARING AND BRUTALITY WERE RELATED OF HIM ONE DAY HE CARRIED OFF A YOUNG GIRL THE DAUGHTER OF A SURVEYOR OF FROSINONE THE BANDIT'S LAWS ARE POSITIVE A YOUNG GIRL BELONGS FIRST TO HIM WHO CARRIES HER OFF
7367-86737-0078 THEN THE REST DRAW LOTS FOR HER AND SHE IS ABANDONED TO THEIR BRUTALITY UNTIL DEATH RELIEVES HER SUFFERINGS WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY RICH TO PAY A RANSOM A MESSENGER IS SENT TO NEGOTIATE THE PRISONER IS HOSTAGE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE MESSENGER
7367-86737-0079 WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0080 AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
7367-86737-0081 WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE PINE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREST MADE A VEIL OF HER PICTURESQUE HEAD DRESS TO HIDE HER FACE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS GAZE OF THE BANDITS THERE HE TOLD THE CHIEF ALL HIS AFFECTION FOR THE PRISONER
7367-86737-0082 THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
7367-86737-0083 CUCUMETTO SEEMED TO YIELD TO HIS FRIEND'S ENTREATIES AND BADE HIM FIND A SHEPHERD TO SEND TO RITA'S FATHER AT FROSINONE CARLINI FLEW JOYFULLY TO RITA TELLING HER SHE WAS SAVED AND BIDDING HER WRITE TO HER FATHER TO INFORM HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
7367-86737-0084 AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
7367-86737-0085 HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
7367-86737-0086 CARLINI RETURNED ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS MISTRESS AND ANNOUNCE THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE HE FOUND THE TROOP IN THE GLADE SUPPING OFF THE PROVISIONS EXACTED AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PEASANTS BUT HIS EYE VAINLY SOUGHT RITA AND CUCUMETTO AMONG THEM
7367-86737-0087 SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
7367-86737-0088 WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
7367-86737-0089 THE ONE WITH A SMILE OF LASCIVIOUSNESS ON HIS LIPS THE OTHER WITH THE PALLOR OF DEATH ON HIS BROW A TERRIBLE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN SEEMED IMMINENT BUT BY DEGREES CARLINI'S FEATURES RELAXED HIS HAND WHICH HAD GRASPED ONE OF THE PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
7367-86737-0090 THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI
7367-86737-0091 WHY SHOULD AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN HER FAVOR I THOUGHT THAT MY ENTREATIES' WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU ANY MORE THAN THE REST TO ASK FOR AN EXCEPTION IS TRUE
7367-86737-0092 CONTINUED CUCUMETTO LAUGHING SOONER OR LATER YOUR TURN WILL COME CARLINI'S TEETH CLINCHED CONVULSIVELY NOW THEN SAID CUCUMETTO ADVANCING TOWARDS THE OTHER BANDITS ARE YOU COMING
7367-86737-0093 HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
7367-86737-0094 THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
7367-86737-0095 AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF
7367-86737-0096 AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
7367-86737-0097 DIAVOLACCIO SAID HE CALMLY AND HE DRANK IT OFF WITHOUT HIS HAND TREMBLING IN THE LEAST THEN SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE MY SUPPER SAID HE MY EXPEDITION HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE
7367-86737-0098 THAT IS ACTING LIKE A GOOD FELLOW AND THEY ALL FORMED A CIRCLE ROUND THE FIRE
7367-86737-0099 CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
7367-86737-0100 THAT EVERY ONE ROSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARLINI WHO REMAINED SEATED AND ATE AND DRANK CALMLY DIAVOLACCIO ADVANCED AMIDST THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE AND LAID RITA AT THE CAPTAIN'S FEET
7367-86737-0101 I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY CARLINI STAYED BEHIND ALL SAVAGE NATURES APPRECIATE A DESPERATE DEED NO OTHER OF THE BANDITS WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE THE SAME BUT THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT CARLINI HAD DONE NOW THEN CRIED CARLINI
7367-86737-0102 RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE CORPSE HIS HAND ON THE BUTT OF ONE OF HIS PISTOLS DOES ANY ONE DISPUTE THE POSSESSION OF THIS WOMAN WITH ME
7367-86737-0103 RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
7367-86737-0104 AT MIDNIGHT THE SENTINEL GAVE THE ALARM AND IN AN INSTANT ALL WERE ON THE ALERT IT WAS RITA'S FATHER WHO BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S RANSOM IN PERSON HERE SAID HE TO CUCUMETTO HERE ARE THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD
7367-86737-0105 BUT THE CHIEF WITHOUT TAKING THE MONEY
7367-86737-0106 THE OLD MAN OBEYED THEY BOTH ADVANCED BENEATH THE TREES THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES STREAMED THE MOONLIGHT CUCUMETTO STOPPED AT LAST AND POINTED TO TWO PERSONS GROUPED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE THERE SAID HE DEMAND THY CHILD OF CARLINI
7367-86737-0107 HE WILL TELL THEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER AND HE RETURNED TO HIS COMPANIONS THE OLD MAN REMAINED MOTIONLESS HE FELT THAT SOME GREAT AND UNFORESEEN MISFORTUNE HUNG OVER HIS HEAD AT LENGTH HE ADVANCED TOWARD THE GROUP THE MEANING OF WHICH HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND
7367-86737-0108 AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
7367-86737-0109 THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
7367-86737-0110 I LOVED HER THEREFORE I SLEW HER FOR SHE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE SPORT OF THE WHOLE BAND THE OLD MAN SPOKE NOT AND GREW PALE AS DEATH NOW CONTINUED CARLINI IF I HAVE DONE WRONGLY AVENGE HER
7367-86737-0111 AND WITHDRAWING THE KNIFE FROM THE WOUND IN RITA'S BOSOM HE HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD MAN WITH ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TORE OPEN HIS VEST
7367-86737-0112 RETURNED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE EMBRACE ME MY SON CARLINI THREW HIMSELF SOBBING LIKE A CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF HIS MISTRESS'S FATHER THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS THE MAN OF BLOOD HAD EVER WEPT NOW SAID THE OLD MAN
7367-86737-0113 AID ME TO BURY MY CHILD CARLINI FETCHED TWO PICKAXES AND THE FATHER AND THE LOVER BEGAN TO DIG AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE OAK BENEATH WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL WAS TO REPOSE WHEN THE GRAVE WAS FORMED THE FATHER KISSED HER FIRST AND THEN THE LOVER
7367-86737-0114 THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
7367-86737-0115 I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
7367-86737-0116 AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK CUCUMETTO AROUSED HIS MEN AND GAVE THE WORD TO MARCH BUT CARLINI WOULD NOT QUIT THE FOREST WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD BECOME OF RITA'S FATHER HE WENT TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
7367-86737-0117 HE FOUND THE OLD MAN SUSPENDED FROM ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHICH SHADED HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE HE THEN TOOK AN OATH OF BITTER VENGEANCE OVER THE DEAD BODY OF THE ONE AND THE TOMB OF THE OTHER
7367-86737-0118 HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BALL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS THAT ASTONISHMENT CEASED WHEN ONE OF THE BRIGANDS REMARKED TO HIS COMRADES THAT CUCUMETTO WAS STATIONED TEN PACES IN CARLINI'S REAR WHEN HE FELL ON THE MORNING OF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST OF FROSINONE
150-132655-0000 BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
150-132655-0001 CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
150-132655-0002 THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
150-132655-0003 IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
150-132655-0004 HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
150-132655-0005 HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0006 AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
150-132655-0007 I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES
150-132655-0008 IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
150-132655-0009 THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
150-132655-0010 PANGLOSS OWNED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED HORRIBLY BUT AS HE HAD ONCE ASSERTED THAT EVERYTHING WENT WONDERFULLY WELL HE ASSERTED IT STILL THOUGH HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IT WHAT HELPED TO CONFIRM MARTIN IN HIS DETESTABLE PRINCIPLES
150-132655-0011 THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
150-132655-0012 THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
150-132655-0013 HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
150-132655-0014 AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
150-132655-0015 MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
150-132655-0016 THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
150-132655-0017 WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
150-132655-0018 AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
150-132655-0019 ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
150-132655-0020 I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0021 I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
150-132655-0022 WITH KAIMAK ENRICHED WITH THE CANDIED PEEL OF CITRONS WITH ORANGES LEMONS PINE APPLES PISTACHIO NUTS AND MOCHA COFFEE UNADULTERATED WITH THE BAD COFFEE OF BATAVIA OR THE AMERICAN ISLANDS
150-132655-0023 YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
150-132655-0024 MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
150-132655-0025 GRANDEUR SAID PANGLOSS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR IN SHORT EGLON KING OF MOAB WAS ASSASSINATED BY EHUD ABSALOM WAS HUNG BY HIS HAIR AND PIERCED WITH THREE DARTS
150-132655-0026 KING NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM WAS KILLED BY BAASA

150-132655-0028 DIONYSIUS OF SYRACUSE PYRRHUS PERSEUS HANNIBAL JUGURTHA ARIOVISTUS CAESAR POMPEY NERO OTHO VITELLIUS DOMITIAN
150-132655-0029 THAT WE MUST CULTIVATE OUR GARDEN YOU ARE RIGHT SAID PANGLOSS FOR WHEN MAN WAS FIRST PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE WAS PUT THERE UT OPERARETUR EUM THAT HE MIGHT CULTIVATE IT WHICH SHOWS THAT MAN WAS NOT BORN TO BE IDLE
150-132655-0030 LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
150-132655-0031 BUT SHE BECAME AN EXCELLENT PASTRY COOK
150-132655-0032 THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
150-132655-0033 FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
150-132655-0034 THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
150-132655-0035 IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
150-126112-0000 THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
150-126112-0001 SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
150-126112-0002 WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
150-126112-0003 IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
150-126112-0004 THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
150-126112-0005 THE COURTIERS DID NOT RESENT HIS BLUNTNESS EXCEPT BY SAYING TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING IT OUT IN IMPUDENCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO BE PUT IN THE GOLDEN PLATE CONTAINED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT
150-126112-0006 THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
150-126112-0007 HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
150-126112-0008 THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
150-126112-0009 AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
150-126112-0010 THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
150-126112-0011 TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
150-126112-0012 AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
150-126112-0013 REPEATED THE PRINCE ENCOURAGED BY SEEING HER WIDE AWAKE AND LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE WATER WELL SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND
150-126112-0014 AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
150-126112-0015 REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
150-126112-0016 FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
150-126112-0017 AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
150-126112-0018 NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
150-126112-0019 ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
150-126112-0020 AND GUSH AFTER GUSH THE WATERS WERE RISING UP THE PRINCE'S BODY THEY WERE UP TO HIS WAIST NOW WHY CAN'T WE GO AND HAVE A SWIM SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126112-0021 I SHALL NEVER SWIM MORE SAID THE PRINCE OH I FORGOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND WAS SILENT SO THE WATER GREW AND GREW AND ROSE UP AND UP ON THE PRINCE
150-126112-0022 AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
150-126112-0023 AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
150-126112-0024 YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
150-126112-0025 HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
150-126112-0026 IT TOUCHED HIS CHIN IT TOUCHED HIS LOWER LIP IT TOUCHED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE SHUT THEM HARD TO KEEP IT OUT THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL STRANGE IT TOUCHED HIS UPPER LIP
150-126112-0027 HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
150-126112-0028 AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
150-126112-0029 AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
150-126112-0030 LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
150-126112-0031 BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
150-126112-0032 TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
150-126112-0033 BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
150-126112-0034 AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
150-126112-0035 SOMEHOW THE DOCTORS NEVER CAME SO THE PRINCESS AND HER OLD NURSE WERE LEFT WITH THE PRINCE BUT THE OLD NURSE WAS A WISE WOMAN AND KNEW WHAT TO DO THEY TRIED EVERYTHING FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SUCCESS
150-126112-0036 THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
3526-176651-0000 AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
3526-176651-0001 AS ON THE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE STEEPS BELOW HER BEYOND THEM WAS A GAP IN THE NEXT MOUNTAIN CHAIN AND DOWN IN THE LITTLE VALLEY JUST VISIBLE THROUGH IT WERE TRAILING BLUE MISTS AS WELL AND SHE KNEW
3526-176651-0002 THAT THEY WERE SMOKE WHERE WAS THE GREAT GLARE OF YELLOW LIGHT THAT THE CIRCUIT RIDER HAD TOLD ABOUT AND THE LEAPING TONGUES OF FIRE WHERE WAS THE SHRIEKING MONSTER THAT RAN WITHOUT HORSES LIKE THE WIND
3526-176651-0003 AND TOSSED BACK ROLLING BLACK PLUMES ALL STREAKED WITH FIRE FOR MANY DAYS NOW SHE HAD HEARD STORIES OF THE FURRINERS WHO HAD COME INTO THOSE HILLS AND WERE DOING STRANGE THINGS DOWN THERE AND SO AT LAST
3526-176651-0004 SHE HAD CLIMBED UP THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING FROM THE COVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE THE WONDERS FOR HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER BEEN UP THERE BEFORE SHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE NOW AND IF SHE WERE FOUND OUT WHEN SHE GOT BACK
3526-176651-0005 SHE WOULD GET A SCOLDING AND MAYBE SOMETHING WORSE FROM HER STEP MOTHER AND ALL THAT TROUBLE AND RISK FOR NOTHING BUT SMOKE SO SHE LAY BACK AND RESTED HER LITTLE MOUTH TIGHTENING FIERCELY
3526-176651-0006 IT WAS A BIG WORLD THOUGH THAT WAS SPREAD BEFORE HER AND A VAGUE AWE OF IT SEIZED HER STRAIGHTWAY AND HELD HER MOTIONLESS AND DREAMING BEYOND THOSE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE HILLS
3526-176651-0007 BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
3526-176651-0008 AND HAD BROUGHT BACK WONDERFUL STORIES OF THAT OUTER WORLD AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER GO INTO IT AND SEE FOR HERSELF WHAT WAS THERE WITH THE THOUGHT SHE ROSE SLOWLY TO HER FEET
3526-176651-0009 MOVED SLOWLY TO THE CLIFF THAT DROPPED SHEER TEN FEET ASIDE FROM THE TRAIL AND STOOD THERE LIKE A GREAT SCARLET FLOWER IN STILL AIR THERE WAS THE WAY AT HER FEET
3526-176651-0010 THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
3526-176651-0011 SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
3526-176651-0012 WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
3526-176651-0013 THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
3526-176651-0014 WITH A THUMPING HEART SHE PUSHED SLOWLY FORWARD THROUGH THE BRUSH UNTIL HER FACE FOX LIKE WITH CUNNING AND SCREENED BY A BLUEBERRY BUSH HUNG JUST OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND THERE SHE LAY
3526-176651-0015 LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
3526-176651-0016 AND SOMETHING MORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS A MAN BUT SHE HAD DROPPED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE BIG BLACK HORSE
3526-176651-0017 NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
3526-176651-0018 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
3526-176651-0019 WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
3526-176651-0020 IN HER WONDER OVER HIM SHE ALMOST FORGOT HERSELF FORGOT TO WONDER WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS COMING INTO THOSE LONELY HILLS UNTIL AS HIS HORSE TURNED A BEND OF THE TRAIL
3526-176651-0021 SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
3526-176651-0022 SPRANG TO HER FEET DASHED PAST THE BIG TREE AND WINGED WITH FEAR SPED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING IN A SPOT OF SUNLIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE PINE
3526-176653-0000 THE FERNS DRENCHED HIS STIRRUPS AS HE BRUSHED THROUGH THEM AND EACH DRIPPING TREE TOP BROKE THE SUNLIGHT AND LET IT DROP IN TENT LIKE BEAMS THROUGH THE SHIMMERING UNDERMIST A BIRD FLASHED HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE GREEN GLOOM
3526-176653-0001 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
3526-176653-0002 AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
3526-176653-0003 HE TURNED BACK UP THE CREEK AND PASSED SO CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SLIPPED ASIDE INTO THE BUSHES THAT SHE CAME NEAR SHRIEKING BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON A POOL OF THE CREEK ABOVE AND TO HER WONDER HE STROLLED STRAIGHT INTO THE WATER WITH HIS BOOTS ON
3526-176653-0004 PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
3526-176653-0005 AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
3526-176653-0006 HER EYES GOT BIG WITH WONDER TAKE IT TO PIECES AND MAKE IT INTO A LONG LIMBER ROD IN A MOMENT HE HAD CAST A MINNOW INTO THE POOL AND WADED OUT INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS HIPS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO QUEER A FISHING POLE SO QUEER A FISHERMAN
3526-176653-0007 HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
3526-176653-0008 BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
3526-176653-0009 DROWNING HIM STEPPING BACKWARD AT THE SAME TIME AND A MOMENT LATER THE FISH SLID EASILY OUT OF THE EDGE OF THE WATER GASPING ALONG THE EDGE OF A LOW SAND BANK AND THE FISHERMAN REACHING DOWN WITH ONE HAND CAUGHT HIM IN THE GILLS THEN
3526-176653-0010 HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL

3526-176653-0015 HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY A LONG CRY CAME DOWN THE RAVINE

3526-176653-0019 DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU

3526-176653-0035 HE WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND HE WOULD GO UP AND SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE GIANT AGAIN AND GET THAT PROMISED DRAM ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE LET HIS MINNOW FLOAT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW OF A BIG ROCK
3526-176653-0036 A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
3526-176653-0037 ONLY ONE ANSWERED HALE WITH EQUAL CHEER THE OLD WOMAN PUSHED BACK HER BONNET AS HE WADED THROUGH THE WATER TOWARDS THEM AND HE SAW THAT SHE WAS PUFFING A CLAY PIPE SHE LOOKED AT THE FISHERMAN AND HIS TACKLE WITH THE NAIVE WONDER OF A CHILD
3526-176653-0038 AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
3526-176653-0039 HALE SMILED HE LOVED OLD PEOPLE AND TWO KINDER FACES HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO GENTLER VOICES HE HAD NEVER HEARD
3526-176653-0040 SAID THE OLD MAN CHUCKLING BUT THAR'S A SIGHT OF EM DOWN THAR BELOW MY OLD MILL QUIETLY THE OLD WOMAN HIT THE HORSE WITH A STRIPPED BRANCH OF ELM AND THE OLD GRAY WITH A SWITCH OF HIS TAIL STARTED

3526-176653-0042 THE OLD MAN REMONSTRATING IN THE KINDLIEST WAY THE OLD WOMAN SILENTLY PUFFING HER PIPE AND MAKING NO ANSWER EXCEPT TO FLAY GENTLY THE RUMP OF THE LAZY OLD GRAY HESITATING HARDLY A MOMENT HALE UNJOINTED HIS POLE
3526-176653-0043 LEFT HIS MINNOW BUCKET WHERE IT WAS MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE UP THE PATH ABOUT HIM THE BEECH LEAVES GAVE BACK THE GOLD OF THE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE RAVINE HIGH UNDER THE CREST OF THE MOTTLED MOUNTAIN WAS ON FIRE WITH THE SCARLET OF MAPLE
3526-176653-0044 WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
3526-176653-0045 HALF HIDDEN BY WILLOWS AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST AND A TURN IN THE PATH BROUGHT INTO VIEW A LOG CABIN WELL CHINKED WITH STONES AND PLASTER AND WITH A WELL BUILT PORCH A FENCE RAN AROUND THE YARD
3526-176653-0046 GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
3526-176653-0048 IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
3526-176653-0049 THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
3526-176653-0050 GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
3526-176653-0051 SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
3526-176653-0052 THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
3526-176653-0053 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
3526-176653-0054 AND HIS PEAL OF LAUGHTER DID WHAT HIS STERNNESS FAILED TO DO THE LITTLE FELLOW WHEELED SUDDENLY AND HIS FEET SPURNED THE SAND AROUND THE BUSHES FOR HOME THE ASTONISHED FROG DRAGGED BUMPING AFTER HIM WELL
1624-168623-0000 THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
1624-168623-0001 SO THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR SQUARE
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0003 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0004 HER BIG FACE DOTTED WITH RED BLOTCHES PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF A SKIMMER SHE HAD A BEARD SHE WAS AN IDEAL MARKET PORTER DRESSED IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES SHE SWORE SPLENDIDLY
1624-168623-0005 SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
1624-168623-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0007 WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
1624-168623-0008 HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING HE HAD THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0010 HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN OLD BLACK COAT HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE
1624-168623-0011 HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
1624-168623-0012 THE SPECIES DOES EXIST IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE SIXTH OR THE NINTH LIGHT SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO
1624-168623-0013 HE HAD ALONE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF A SQUADRON OF DEATH DEALING HUSSARS COVERED WITH HIS BODY AND SAVED FROM DEATH IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT A GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
1624-168623-0014 THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
1624-168623-0015 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0016 BEING COMFORTABLY ASTRIDE OF BOTH FRONTIERS AS FOR HIS PROWESS AT WATERLOO THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT HE EXAGGERATED IT A TRIFLE EBB AND FLOW
1624-168623-0017 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0018 BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
1624-168623-0019 THIS CAMPAIGN ENDED AND HAVING AS HE SAID
1624-168623-0020 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0021 ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY HE WAS A FINE TALKER HE ALLOWED IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
1624-168623-0022 BUT PRACTISED EYES SOMETIMES SPIED OUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN IT THENARDIER WAS CUNNING GREEDY SLOTHFUL AND CLEVER HE DID NOT DISDAIN HIS SERVANTS WHICH CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0025 AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
1624-168623-0026 WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
1624-168623-0027 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0028 SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
1624-168623-0029 EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0031 THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH
1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0034 VIEWED ON ITS DWARFED AND GROTESQUE SIDE THIS WAS THAT GRAND AND UNIVERSAL THING THE ADORATION OF MIND BY MATTER FOR CERTAIN UGLY FEATURES HAVE A CAUSE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY
1624-168623-0035 HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER CHILDREN
1624-168623-0036 AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS A MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS THE MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
1624-168623-0037 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0038 IF RUIN IS POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
1624-168623-0039 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0040 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
1624-168623-0042 AND QUOTED FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
1624-168623-0043 HE HAD PROFESSIONAL APHORISMS WHICH HE INSERTED INTO HIS WIFE'S MIND THE DUTY OF THE INN KEEPER
1624-168623-0044 AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY
1624-168623-0045 TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
1624-168623-0046 TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING
1624-168623-0047 THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND TERRIBLE TEAM WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT OF ABSENT CREDITORS
1624-168623-0048 TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR DOUBLE PRESSURE
1624-168623-0049 THE MAN AND THE WOMAN EACH HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD COSETTE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH BLOWS THIS WAS THE WOMAN'S SHE WENT BAREFOOTED IN WINTER THAT WAS THE MAN'S DOING
1624-168623-0050 COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS DID THE COARSE WORK THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
1624-168623-0052 IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE FLY SERVING THE SPIDERS THE POOR CHILD PASSIVELY HELD HER PEACE WHAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THESE SOULS WHEN THEY HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED GOD FIND THEMSELVES THUS
1624-168623-0053 AT THE VERY DAWN OF LIFE VERY SMALL
2007-149877-0000 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0001 THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
2007-149877-0002 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0004 HE LOVED FINE CLOTHES GOOD EATING AND PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY AND ACQUAINTANCESHIP OF SUCCESSFUL MEN WHEN DINING IT WAS A SOURCE OF KEEN SATISFACTION TO HIM TO KNOW THAT JOSEPH JEFFERSON WAS WONT TO COME TO THIS SAME PLACE
2007-149877-0005 OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
2007-149877-0006 SOME RICH YOUNG ROUNDERS OF THE TOWN ALL EATING AND DRINKING AMID A BUZZ OF POPULAR COMMONPLACE CONVERSATION THAT'S SO AND SO OVER THERE WAS A COMMON REMARK OF THESE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEMSELVES
2007-149877-0007 PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
2007-149877-0008 WHY HE'S MANAGER OF THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD FALL UPON DROUET'S EARS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE STIFFLY AND EAT WITH SOLID COMFORT IF HE HAD ANY VANITY THIS AUGMENTED IT
2007-149877-0009 THE FLOORS WERE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED TILES THE WALLS A COMPOSITION OF RICH DARK POLISHED WOOD WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT AND COLOURED STUCCO WORK WHICH GAVE THE PLACE A VERY SUMPTUOUS APPEARANCE
2007-149877-0010 THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
2007-149877-0011 WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S
2007-149877-0012 HE HAD BEEN POINTED OUT AS A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WELL KNOWN MAN ABOUT TOWN HURSTWOOD LOOKED THE PART FOR BESIDES BEING SLIGHTLY UNDER FORTY HE HAD A GOOD STOUT CONSTITUTION AN ACTIVE MANNER AND A SOLID SUBSTANTIAL AIR
2007-149877-0013 WHICH WAS COMPOSED IN PART OF HIS FINE CLOTHES HIS CLEAN LINEN HIS JEWELS AND ABOVE ALL HIS OWN SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE DROUET IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVED A NOTION OF HIM AS BEING SOME ONE WORTH KNOWING
2007-149877-0014 AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
2007-149877-0015 AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
2007-149877-0016 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
2007-149877-0017 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0018 AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
2007-149877-0019 HUNDREDS OF ACTORS MERCHANTS POLITICIANS AND THE GENERAL RUN OF SUCCESSFUL CHARACTERS ABOUT TOWN AND IT WAS PART OF HIS SUCCESS TO DO SO HE HAD A FINELY GRADUATED SCALE OF INFORMALITY AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE HOW DO YOU DO
2007-149877-0020 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0022 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2007-149877-0023 THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
2007-149877-0024 TO GO TO THE RACES THE THEATRES THE SPORTING ENTERTAINMENTS AT SOME OF THE CLUBS HE KEPT A HORSE AND NEAT TRAP HAD HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NEAT HOUSE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK
2007-149877-0025 AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ACCEPTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN UPPER CLASS THE FIRST GRADE BELOW THE LUXURIOUSLY RICH
2007-149877-0026 THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
2007-149877-0027 HURSTWOOD KNEW CARYOE QUITE WELL HAVING DRUNK A GLASS NOW AND THEN WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS GENERAL
2007-149877-0028 A MODERATE SENSE OF HUMOUR AND COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WHEN THE OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD TALK RACES WITH HURSTWOOD
2007-149877-0029 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN
2007-149877-0031 HOW GOES IT THE ROOM WAS CROWDED DROUET SHOOK HANDS BEAMING GOOD NATURE AND THEY STROLLED TOWARDS THE BAR OH ALL RIGHT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN SIX WEEKS WHEN DID YOU GET IN
2007-149877-0032 FRIDAY SAID DROUET HAD A FINE TRIP GLAD OF IT SAID HURSTWOOD HIS BLACK EYES LIT WITH A WARMTH WHICH HALF DISPLACED THE COLD MAKE BELIEVE THAT USUALLY DWELT IN THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HE ADDED AS THE BARKEEPER IN SNOWY JACKET AND TIE
2007-149877-0033 LEANED TOWARD THEM FROM BEHIND THE BAR OLD PEPPER SAID DROUET A LITTLE OF THE SAME FOR ME PUT IN HURSTWOOD HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN THIS TIME INQUIRED HURSTWOOD ONLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY I'M GOING UP TO SAINT PAUL
2007-149877-0034 GEORGE EVANS WAS IN HERE SATURDAY AND SAID HE SAW YOU IN MILWAUKEE LAST WEEK YES I SAW GEORGE RETURNED DROUET GREAT OLD BOY ISN'T HE WE HAD QUITE A TIME THERE TOGETHER
2007-149877-0035 AS WAS CONSIDERED PROPER AND HURSTWOOD TAKING THE BAREST SUGGESTION OF WHISKEY AND MODIFYING IT WITH SELTZER WHAT'S BECOME OF CARYOE REMARKED HURSTWOOD I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND HERE IN TWO WEEKS
2007-149877-0036 BARELY COMES DOWN TO THE OFFICE NOW JUST ONE BOY HASN'T HE ASKED HURSTWOOD YES AND A SWIFT PACER LAUGHED DROUET I
2007-149877-0037 NO HE CAN'T INJURE THAT ANY I GUESS HURSTWOOD WAS STANDING HIS COAT OPEN HIS THUMBS IN HIS POCKETS THE LIGHT ON HIS JEWELS AND RINGS RELIEVING THEM WITH AGREEABLE DISTINCTNESS HE WAS THE PICTURE OF FASTIDIOUS COMFORT
2007-149877-0038 TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
2007-149877-0039 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0040 IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT SCHEMERS WOULD CHOOSE MORE SEQUESTERED QUARTERS TO ARRANGE THEIR PLANS THAT POLITICIANS WOULD NOT GATHER HERE IN COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING SAVE FORMALITIES WHERE THE SHARP EARED MAY HEAR AND IT WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF THIRST
2007-149877-0041 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0043 THE COMPANY THE GLOW THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THEY FOUND ONE MIGHT TAKE IT AFTER ALL AS AN AUGUR OF THE BETTER SOCIAL ORDER FOR THE THINGS WHICH THEY SATISFIED HERE THOUGH SENSORY WERE NOT EVIL
2007-149877-0044 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0045 IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT WOULD SCARCELY BE CALLED THE FAULT OF THE DECORATIONS BUT RATHER OF THE INNATE TREND OF THE MIND THAT SUCH A SCENE MIGHT STIR THE LESS EXPENSIVELY DRESSED TO EMULATE THE MORE EXPENSIVELY DRESSED
2007-149877-0046 COULD SCARCELY BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF ANYTHING SAVE THE FALSE AMBITION OF THE MINDS OF THOSE SO AFFECTED REMOVE THE ELEMENT SO THOROUGHLY AND SOLELY COMPLAINED OF LIQUOR
2007-149877-0047 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0048 THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE
2007-149877-0049 UNDER THE SERENE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL STARS MUST SEEM A STRANGE AND SHINY THING UNDER THE STARS AND SWEEPING NIGHT WINDS WHAT A LAMP FLOWER IT MUST BLOOM A
2007-149877-0050 INSECT INFESTED ROSE OF PLEASURE SEE THAT FELLOW COMING IN THERE SAID HURSTWOOD GLANCING AT A GENTLEMAN JUST ENTERING ARRAYED IN A HIGH HAT AND PRINCE ALBERT COAT HIS FAT CHEEKS PUFFED AND RED AS WITH GOOD EATING
2007-149877-0051 NO WHERE SAID DROUET
2007-149877-0052 SAID HURSTWOOD INDICATING THE DIRECTION BY A CAST OF HIS EYE THE MAN WITH THE SILK HAT OH YES SAID DROUET NOW AFFECTING NOT TO SEE WHO IS HE THAT'S JULES WALLACE THE SPIRITUALIST
2007-149877-0053 DROUET FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES MUCH INTERESTED DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A MAN WHO SEES SPIRITS DOES HE SAID DROUET OH I
2007-149877-0054 RETURNED HURSTWOOD HE'S GOT THE MONEY ALL RIGHT AND A LITTLE TWINKLE PASSED OVER HIS EYES I DON'T GO MUCH ON THOSE THINGS DO YOU
2007-149877-0055 WELL YOU NEVER CAN TELL SAID HURSTWOOD THERE MAY BE SOMETHING TO IT I WOULDN'T BOTHER ABOUT IT MYSELF THOUGH BY THE WAY HE ADDED ARE YOU GOING ANYWHERE TO NIGHT THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
2007-149877-0056 SAID DROUET MENTIONING THE POPULAR FARCE OF THE TIME WELL YOU'D BETTER BE GOING IT'S HALF AFTER EIGHT ALREADY AND HE DREW OUT HIS WATCH THE CROWD WAS ALREADY THINNING OUT CONSIDERABLY
2007-149877-0057 SOME BOUND FOR THE THEATRES SOME TO THEIR CLUBS AND SOME TO THAT MOST FASCINATING OF ALL THE PLEASURES FOR THE TYPE OF MAN THERE REPRESENTED AT LEAST THE LADIES YES I WILL SAID DROUET
2007-149877-0058 COME AROUND AFTER THE SHOW I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU SAID HURSTWOOD SURE SAID DROUET ELATED YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING ON HAND FOR THE NIGHT HAVE YOU ADDED HURSTWOOD NOT A THING WELL COME ROUND THEN
2007-149877-0059 I STRUCK A LITTLE PEACH COMING IN ON THE TRAIN FRIDAY REMARKED DROUET BY WAY OF PARTING BY GEORGE THAT'S SO I MUST GO AND CALL ON HER BEFORE I GO AWAY OH NEVER MIND HER HURSTWOOD REMARKED
2007-149877-0060 SAY SHE WAS A LITTLE DANDY I TELL YOU
2007-149877-0061 TWELVE O'CLOCK SAID HURSTWOOD THAT'S RIGHT
1355-39947-0000 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY BOTH THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY THE LIFE INTERESTS OF WHICH ARE SUPERIOR TO THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
1355-39947-0001 IT IS AN UNAVOIDABLE QUESTION HOW FAR FROM THE HIGHER POINT OF VIEW OF THE SOCIAL MIND THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFORTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED OR SUPPRESSED ARE THERE ANY CONDITIONS WHICH SUGGEST SUSPICION OF OR DIRECT OPPOSITION TO SUCH CURATIVE WORK
1355-39947-0002 OF COURSE SOCIETY HAS TO BE SURE THAT NO POSSIBLE MISUSE AND DAMAGE ARE TO RESULT FROM SUCH PRACTICE FEARS IN THAT DIRECTION HAVE BEEN UTTERED REPEATEDLY BUT FROM VERY DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS
1355-39947-0003 ONE WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST OFTEN HEARD IN POPULAR CIRCLES RESULTS FROM AN ENTIRE MISUNDERSTANDING AND DESERVES HARDLY ANY DISCUSSION AFTER OUR DETAILED STUDY OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IT IS CLAIMED THAT SUGGESTIVE POWER ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF
1355-39947-0004 HYPNOTIZATION MAY BE SECRETLY MISUSED TO MAKE ANYONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND AGAINST HIS WILL A PASSIVE INSTRUMENT OF THE HYPNOTIST'S INTENT OFTEN THIS IS COUPLED WITH TELEPATHIC FANCIES
1355-39947-0005 THE HYPNOTIST IS BELIEVED TO HAVE MYSTIC POWER TO BRING ANY PERSON IN A DISTANT REGION UNDER HIS MENTAL CONTROL AND THUS TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT ANY SINISTER PLANS BY THE HELP OF HIS INNOCENT VICTIM ALL HYPNOTIZING THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE INTERDICTED BY THE STATE
1355-39947-0006 THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF SUCH A VIEW ARE AS WE KNOW NOW ENTIRELY ABSURD WE KNOW THAT HYPNOTISM IS NOT BASED ON ANY SPECIAL POWER OF THE HYPNOTIZER THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FLUID IN THE SENSE OF THE OLD MESMERISM
1355-39947-0007 THE IMAGINATION OF THE HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS THE ONLY HYPNOTIZING AGENCY THUS NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR AGAINST HIS WILL THE STORY OF TELEPATHIC MYSTERIES WHICH IS OFTEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
1355-39947-0008 IS PROBABLY ALWAYS THE OUTCOME OF A DISEASED BRAIN IT IS INDEED A FREQUENT SYMPTOM IN PARANOIA AND OTHER INSANITIES THAT THE PATIENT WHO FEELS ABNORMAL ORGANIC SENSATIONS AND ABNORMAL UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSES INTERPRETS THEM AS INFLUENCES OF A DISTANT ENEMY
1355-39947-0009 WHOLE PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH ELABORATION OF SUCH INSANE MISINTERPRETATIONS AND REQUESTS TO LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT SPIRIT BUT THE PHYSICIAN RECOGNIZES EASILY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ARGUMENTATION THE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA OF THE MENTAL DISEASE
1355-39947-0010 TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
1355-39947-0011 BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
1355-39947-0012 THE GOOD EXAMPLE AND THE BAD CAN BE EFFECTIVE BOTH ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE AND IMITATION OF THE EVIL MAY WORK WITH THE SAME MENTAL TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO HAVE A STRONGER INFLUENCE THAN OTHERS ON THE IMAGINATION OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT
1355-39947-0013 THEIR EXPRESSION AWAKENS CONFIDENCE THEIR VOICE AND THEIR WORDS REACH DEEPER LAYERS OF THE MIND THEIR CALMNESS AND FIRMNESS OVERWHELM MORE EASILY THE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS
1355-39947-0014 BUT THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE LIES AFTER ALL IN THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUGGESTIBILITY AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVE SUCH IMPRESSIONS THE EASILY SUGGESTIBLE PERSON CANNOT BE PROTECTED BY ANY INTERDICT HE MAY CATCH SUGGESTIONS EVERYWHERE
1355-39947-0015 ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPER AND ANY DISPLAY IN THE SHOP WINDOW MAY OVERRUN HIS OWN INTENTIONS WHAT HE NEEDS IS TRAINING IN FIRMNESS THE APPLICATION OF REENFORCED SUGGESTION OR EVEN OF HYPNOTISM IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS EVEN FOR HIM
1355-39947-0016 NO POSSIBLE SOURCE OF DANGER ON A HIGHER LEVEL ARE OBJECTIONS WHICH COME FROM SERIOUS QUARTERS AND WHICH ARE NOT WITHOUT SYMPATHY WITH TRUE SCIENCE IN RECENT TIMES THIS OPPOSITION HAS REPEATEDLY FOUND ELOQUENT EXPRESSION IT IS AN OBJECTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MORALITY
1355-39947-0017 BELONGING THEREFORE ENTIRELY TO THE PURPOSIVE VIEW OF THE MIND BUT WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS PURPOSIVE VIEW TOO AS LONG AS WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0018 NO OTHER VIEW OF MENTAL LIFE EXCEPT THE CAUSAL ONE COULD BE IN QUESTION AS SOON AS WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COMMUNITY IT BECOMES OUR DUTY TO BRING THE CAUSAL AND THE PURPOSIVE VIEW INTO HARMONY AND IT WOULD BE NARROW AND SHORT SIGHTED SIMPLY TO
1355-39947-0019 DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
1355-39947-0020 THIS OPPOSITION ARGUES AS FOLLOWS HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE BRINGS THE PATIENT UNDER THE WILL CONTROL OF THE HYPNOTIZER AND THUS DESTROYS HIS OWN FREEDOM WHATEVER THE PATIENT MAY REACH IN THE ALTERED STATES IS REACHED WITHOUT HIS OWN EFFORT WHILE HE IS THE PASSIVE RECEIVER
1355-39947-0021 HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS THEREFORE NO MORAL VALUE AND IF HE IS REALLY CURED OF HIS DRUNKENNESS OR OF HIS PERVERSE HABITS OF HIS MISUSE OF COCAINE OR OF HIS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES HE HAS LOST THE RIGHT TO BE COUNTED A MORAL AGENT IT WOULD BE BETTER
1355-39947-0022 IF THERE WERE MORE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD THAN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE MORAL WILL SHOULD BE UNDERMINED NO ONE OUGHT TO TAKE SUCH ARGUMENTS LIGHTLY THE SPIRIT WHICH DIRECTS THEM IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR TIME OF REACHING OUT FOR SUPERFICIAL GOODS
1355-39947-0023 NO ONE CAN INSIST TOO EARNESTLY THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING ONLY IF IT SERVES MORAL DUTIES AND MORAL FREEDOM AND IS NOT DETERMINED BY PLEASURES AND ABSENCE OF PAIN ONLY THOSE WHO SET FORTH THIS ARGUMENT ARE ENTIRELY WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
1355-39947-0024 PROFOUND EFFECT WHICH SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MAY CREATE MORE THAN THIS THEY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO GAIN A BASIS FOR THEIR ATTACK JUST BECAUSE THE HYPNOTIZER CAN ENTIRELY CHANGE THE DESIRES AND PASSIONS THE HABITS AND PERVERSITIES OF THE SUFFERING VICTIM
1355-39947-0025 HE SEEMS TO THEM A MORAL WRONGDOER WHO NEGATES THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN FREEDOM A FORCIBLE BOOK OF RECENT DAYS CALLS THE SUGGESTIVE POWER OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME IT SAYS TO THE HYPNOTIST
1355-39947-0026 BY YOUR OWN TESTIMONY YOU STAND CONVICTED OF APPLYING A PROCESS WHICH DEPRIVES YOUR SUBJECTS OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHT AND POWER OF INDIVIDUAL SELF CONTROL IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE POWER OF SELF CONTROL
1355-39947-0027 YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THAT UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE FREE CONTROL AND EXERCISE OF THOSE POWERS OF THE SOUL UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND
1355-39947-0028 YOU THEREBY ROB HIM OF THOSE POWERS UPON WHICH HE MUST DEPEND FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL IMMORTALITY BUT THIS CENSURE TOO IS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN NOT BECAUSE IT URGES THE PURPOSIVE VIEWS AGAINST THE CAUSAL
1355-39947-0029 BUT BECAUSE IT IS IN ERROR AS TO THE FACTS SUCH CRITICS ARE FULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARTLING RESULTS WHICH ARE REACHED THEY DO NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG AND DIFFICULT WAY WHICH HAS HAD TO BE TRAVERSED WITH PATIENCE AND ENERGY
1355-39947-0030 IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT IF I HYPNOTIZE A MAN AND SUGGEST TO HIM TO TAKE UP AFTER AWAKING THE BOOK WHICH LIES ON MY TABLE HE FOLLOWS MY SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONFLICT AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE WITHOUT FREEDOM HE FEELS A SIMPLE IMPULSE TO GO TO THE TABLE AND LIFT THE BOOK AND
1355-39947-0031 AS NO STRONGER NATURAL DESIRE AND NO MORAL OBJECTION STAND IN THE WAY HE CARRIES OUT THAT MEANINGLESS IMPULSE AND PERHAPS EVEN INVENTS A FOOLISH MOTIVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF WHY HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT BOOK
1355-39947-0032 BUT AFTER A LONG EXPERIENCE I HAVE MY DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER A MAN WAS EVER CURED IN SUCH A WAY BY HYPNOTISM OF SERIOUS DISTURBANCES AND OF THOSE ANOMALOUS ACTIONS WHICH THE CRITICS WANT TO SEE OVERCOME BY THE PATIENT'S OWN MORAL EFFORTS ON THE CONTRARY
1355-39947-0033 EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED
1355-39947-0034 IF AGAIN AND AGAIN I HESITATE TO UNDERTAKE NEW CASES IT IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE DURING THE TREATMENT TOO MUCH OF THIS DAILY AND HOURLY STRIVING AGAINST OVERPOWERING IMPULSES THE JOY OF REMOVING SOME OBSTACLES FROM THE WAY OF THE PATIENTS
1355-39947-0035 IS TOO MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY THE DEEP PITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THEIR SUFFERING AND CRAVING DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF SUCCESSIVE TREATMENTS TO MAKE A MAN FIGHT WHERE DESPAIR IS INEVITABLE AND WHERE THE ENEMY IS NECESSARILY STRONGER THAN HIS OWN POWERS CAN CERTAINLY NOT BE THE MORAL DEMAND
1355-39947-0036 MORALITY POSTULATES THAT EVERYONE FIND CONDITIONS IN WHICH HE CAN BE VICTORIOUS IF HE PUTS HIS STRONGEST EFFORTS TO THE TASK IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE MENTAL SYMPTOMS I REPORTED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SUGGESTIVE TREATMENT OF THE DRUG PASSION
1355-39947-0037 THE CASE OF A MORPHINIST TO MAKE CLEAR THIS PURPOSIVE SIDE OF THE CASE AS AGAINST THE CAUSAL ONE WHICH ALONE INTERESTED THE PHYSICIAN I MAY ADD A FEW FEATURES TO THE SHORT REPORT AS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE
1355-39947-0038 WHEN THAT MAN LEFT MY LABORATORY FOR THE LAST TIME TO GO OUT TO WORK AND HAPPINESS YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE BELIEVED FROM HIS JOYFUL FACE THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EASY AND PLEASANT TIME IN WHICH HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE SMOOTHLY REMOVED FROM HIM THE DANGEROUS DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0039 IN TRUTH IT WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR MONTHS OF THE MOST NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS A SLAVE TO HIS PASSION TO QUOTE FROM HIS LITTLE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ADDICTED TO MORPHINE
1355-39947-0040 THAT IS COMING TO ANYONE WHO IS THE USER OF OPIUM OR ANY OF ITS ALKALOIDS FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I FOUND GREAT RELIEF AFTER EVERY INJECTION OF MORPHINE BUT SOON I COULD NOT GET THE SAME EASY FEELING AND COULD EAT BUT VERY LITTLE AND WHAT SLEEP I GOT WAS IN THE DAYTIME
1355-39947-0041 I FINALLY WENT TO THE SANITARIUM OF A DOCTOR
1355-39947-0042 WHEN I FIRST WENT TO SEE THE PROFESSOR IN THE HARVARD PSYCHOLOGICAL LABORATORY I WAS USING BETWEEN THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY EIGHT GRAINS OF MORPHINE DAILY HE PUT ME UNDER HIS TREATMENT OCTOBER SIXTH AND THAT DAY CUT ME DOWN BY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT TO NINE GRAINS A DAY OR
1355-39947-0043 THREE DOSES OF THREE GRAINS A DAY I TOOK MY HYPODERMIC AS DIRECTED BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I LAY ON THE BED TOO EXHAUSTED TO GET UP EVEN TO GET AROUND THE ROOM AND I COULD NOT EAT
1355-39947-0044 THE DESIRE FOR THE DRUG WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE BUT IN ABOUT FOUR DAYS I GOT USED TO THE LOSS OF SO MUCH MORPHINE AND STAYED ON THIS AMOUNT FOR A WEEK SEEING THE PROFESSOR EVERY OTHER DAY FOR HYPNOTIC TREATMENT AND THEN RETURNING TO MY ROOM WHERE I SPENT TWENTY TWO HOURS OF THE TWENTY FOUR ON THE BED
1355-39947-0045 BUT DID NOT SLEEP MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOURS A DAY
1355-39947-0046 I WAS CUT OFF BY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION HALF A GRAIN AND THIS PUT ME TO FIGHTING THE DESIRE AGAIN
1355-39947-0047 THESE REDUCTIONS OF THE DOSE WERE MADE A WEEK APART AND SOMETIMES ONLY TWO DAYS THE WORST TIME OF ALL WAS A CUT FROM FOUR INJECTIONS OF A FOURTH OF A GRAIN EACH TO FOUR OF ONE EIGHTH OF A GRAIN EACH WHICH WAS ABOUT JANUARY TENTH
1355-39947-0048 AT THIS TIME I HAD THE WORST TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE I TRIED WHISKEY BUT IT GAVE RELIEF ONLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THE DESIRE WAS WORSE THAN EVER
1355-39947-0049 HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0050 AND FINALLY PRESENTED THE REMAINING TABLETS TO A HOSPITAL AND YET THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE LEAST CHANCE FOR HIS WINNING THIS ETHICAL VICTORY WITHOUT THE OUTER HELP OF THE HYPNOTIST WE DO NOT ELIMINATE THE MORAL WILL BUT WE REMOVE SOME UNFAIR OBSTACLES FROM ITS PATH
1355-39947-0051 WE HAVE NO MYSTIC POWER BY WHICH OUR WILL SIMPLY TAKES HOLD OF THE OTHER MAN'S WILL BUT WE INHIBIT AND SUPPRESS BY INFLUENCE ON THE IMAGINATION THOSE ABNORMAL IMPULSES WHICH RESIST THE SOUND DESIRES IF THAT WERE IMMORAL
1355-39947-0052 WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WERE PERVERTED WITH SUCH IMMORAL ELEMENTS EVERY SOUND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY WHICH MAKES A CHILD WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND MAXIMS OF HIS ELDERS IS JUST SUCH AN INFLUENCE
1355-39947-0053 IF IT WERE REALLY A MORAL DEMAND THAT THE WILL BE LEFT TO ITS OWN RESOURCES AND THAT NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE COME TO STRENGTHEN ITS POWER OR REMOVE ITS HINDRANCES OR SMOOTH ITS PATH THEN WE OUGHT TO LET THE CHILDREN GROW UP AS NATURE CREATED THEM
1355-39947-0054 AND OUGHT NOT TO TRY TO SUPPRESS FROM WITHOUT BY DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING BY LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE WILLFUL IMPULSES AND THE UGLY HABITS EVEN EVERY GOOD MODEL FOR IMITATION IS SUCH A SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT AND EVERY SOLEMN APPEAL TO LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP
1355-39947-0055 TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0056 AND HE WHO BY SUGGESTION HELPS THE WEAK MIND TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES WHICH THE STRONG MIND CAN OVERTHROW FROM ITS INBORN RESOURCES WORKS FOR THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE SPIRIT OF TRUEST MORALITY MUCH MORE JUSTIFIED THAN SUCH
1355-39947-0057 ETHICAL OBJECTIONS ARE THE FEARS WHICH MOVE ENTIRELY IN THE CAUSAL SPHERE IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A METHOD WHICH HAS SUCH POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND THAT IT CAN SECURE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS AND IMPULSES WHICH THE OWN WILL OF THE PATIENT CANNOT PRODUCE
1355-39947-0058 OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED FOR ITS SKILLFUL USE TO HYPNOTIZE OR TO PERFORM ANY PERSISTENT PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MAY THUS BE DANGEROUS IF IT IS DONE BY THE UNFIT
1355-39947-0059 WE HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE THE INJURIES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH POWERFUL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS THROUGH THE BEST MEANING MINISTER BUT WE CAN EXTEND THIS FEAR TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED MEDICINE AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE NORMAL AND ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY
1355-39947-0060 THE POSSIBILITIES OF OVERLOOKING SYMPTOMS WHICH OUGHT TO SUGGEST AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TREATMENT OR OF ADJUSTING THE TREATMENT BADLY TO THE SPECIAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OR OF IGNORING THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL SUPPLEMENT BY DRUGS OR OF CREATING UNINTENTIONALLY BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0061 INJURIOUS EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS OPEN WHEN MEDICAL AMATEURS UNDERTAKE SUCH WORK CERTAINLY THERE IS NO PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES AND A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY ATTENTION TO PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
1355-39947-0062 WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
1355-39947-0063 HE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE METHOD ITSELF IS UNDESIRABLE THAT HIS REAL PREPARATION OUGHT TO INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES WE HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORE AND THE TIME SEEMS RIPE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO URGE SUCH A REFORM OF THE STUDIES
1355-39947-0064 ALL THAT INVOLVES THE CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AS SUCH IS NOT PREPARED TO ENTER INTO MEDICAL TREATMENT AND A PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC MANAGED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO IS NOT A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE
1355-39947-0065 IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THAN A CHURCH CLINIC I CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS MERELY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT'S SAKE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO A HYPNOTIC OR OTHERWISE ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND
1355-39947-0066 IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0067 AND THAT THE PATIENT HAS AGREED BEFOREHAND TO ALLOW IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ANY HYPNOTIZATION FOR MERE AMUSEMENT AND AS A PARLOR TRICK OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS
1355-39947-0068 CRIMINAL ON SOME OTHER OBJECTIONS WHICH INTEREST THE COMMUNITY AS SUCH WE HAD TO TOUCH BEFORE AND THERE IS NO NEED OF RETURNING TO THEM WITH ANY FULLNESS OF ARGUMENT WE SPOKE OF THE DANGER WHICH THE MENTAL CURES CARRY WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON ANY PARTICULAR CREED
1355-39947-0069 WHAT IS GAINED IF SOME NERVOUS DISORDERS ARE HELPED BY BELIEF IF THE BELIEF ITSELF DEVASTATES OUR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND BRINGS THE MASSES DOWN AGAIN TO A VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF BARBARISM
1355-39947-0070 THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1355-39947-0071 ANY ABSURD SUPERSTITION CAN BECOME ACCREDITED BECAUSE ITS CURATIVE VALUE MAY BE EQUAL TO A TRULY VALUABLE SUGGESTION THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER GREATLY IF THE WAY TO BE FREED FROM BODILY SUFFERING
1355-39947-0072 HAD TO BE THE BELIEF IN THE METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINES OF MISSUS EDDY'S SCIENCE AND HEALTH FROM A CULTURAL VIEWPOINT TOO SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MUST STAND THE HIGHER THE MORE SHARPLY IT IS SEPARATED FROM SPECIAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES
1355-39947-0073 NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0074 WHO DOES NOT NEED THE STRONG RELIGIOUS REENFORCEMENT OF THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE HE REENFORCES INSTEAD THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE PATIENT BY SLIGHT INFLUENCES ON HIS SENSES
1355-39947-0075 EVEN WHERE SOUND RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION AND WITHOUT PSEUDOPHILOSOPHY STANDS BEHIND THE THERAPEUTIC WORK THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGLECT BY IT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR
1355-39947-0076 THE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE AND MORE STRONGLY AWARE THAT TOO MANY FACTORS OF OUR MODERN SOCIETY URGE THE CHURCH TO UNDERTAKE NON RELIGIOUS WORK SOCIAL AID AND CHARITY WORK OUGHT TO BE FILLED WITH RELIGIOUS SPIRIT
1355-39947-0077 STILL MORE THAT IS TRUE OF THE HEALING OF THE SICK WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EXPANSION OF CHURCH ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SAPS THE VITAL STRENGTH OF RELIGION ITSELF IS INDEED A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
1355-39947-0078 THE FEAR SUGGESTS ITSELF THAT THE SPIRITUAL ACHIEVEMENT MAY BECOME HAMPERED THAT IN THE COMPETITION OF THE CHURCH WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES OF SOCIAL LIFE THE PARTICULAR CHURCH TASK MAY BE PUSHED TO THE BACKGROUND AND THAT THUS THE CHURCH
1355-39947-0079 IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
1355-39947-0080 THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE
1355-39947-0081 SOCIETY DOES NOT ONLY ASK WHERE PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS BUT ASKS WITH NOT LESS RIGHT WHETHER THE SCHEME AND THE METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FRUCTIFIED FOR OTHER SOCIAL ENDS BESIDES THE MERE HEALING OF THE SICK IF PSYCHOTHERAPY DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0082 HYPNOTISM MAKES POSSIBLE THE RESHAPING OF A PATHOLOGICAL MIND IT IS A NATURAL THOUGHT TO USE THE SAME POWER FOR REMODELING PERHAPS THE LAZY OR THE INTEMPERATE THE CARELESS OR THE INATTENTIVE THE DISHONEST OR THE CRIMINAL MIND
1355-39947-0083 BOTH EDUCATORS AND CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE INDEED OFTEN RAISED SUCH QUESTIONS AND SOCIAL REFORMERS HAVE NOT SELDOM SEEN THERE WIDE PERSPECTIVES FOR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN FUTURE TIMES
1355-39947-0084 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH REMODELING ACTIVITY IS GIVEN BUT AS FAR AS EDUCATION IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY GRAVE MISGIVINGS OUGHT TO BE FELT WHEN WE SPOKE OF THE TREATMENT OF THE SICK
1355-39947-0085 WE HAD ALWAYS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUGGESTION CURES SYMPTOMS BUT NOT DISEASES IN THE SAME WAY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MIGHT REENFORCE A SINGLE TRAIT BUT WOULD NOT REFORM THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHILD
1355-39947-0086 YES THE ARTIFICIAL REENFORCEMENT OF SUCH SPECIAL FEATURES WOULD DEPRIVE EDUCATION OF THAT WHICH IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWER TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES BY OWN ENERGY
1355-39947-0087 WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
1355-39947-0088 IN THE FORM OF GOOD EXAMPLE AND PERSUASIONS AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE LOVE AND SYMPATHY THAT HOLDS TRUE EVEN FOR VERY SLIGHT ABNORMALITIES WHICH SEEM STILL WITHIN THE LIMITS WHERE THE OWN ENERGIES CAN BRING ABOUT THE CURE FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0089 I HAVE STEADILY REFUSED REQUESTS OF STUDENTS AND OTHERS TO USE HYPNOTISM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERCOMING MERELY BAD HABITS SUCH AS THE HABIT OF BITING THE NAILS A CHILD WHO FINDS SOME DIFFICULTY IN STICKING SERIOUSLY TO HIS TASKS MIGHT LEARN NOW THIS
1355-39947-0090 AND NOW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS BUT HE WOULD REMAIN ENTIRELY UNTRAINED FOR MASTERING THE NEXT LESSON IN THE SAME WAY SOME NAUGHTY TRAITS MIGHT BE ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED BUT THE CHILD WOULD NOT GAIN ANYTHING TOWARDS THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT POWER
1355-39947-0091 OF SUPPRESSING AN UGLY TENDENCY BY HIS OWN EFFORT ALL THAT FINDS ITS LIMITS WHERE THE INHIBITIONS OR OBSTACLES IN THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD ARE TOO STRONG POSSIBLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE OWN GOOD WILL BUT IN THAT CASE
1355-39947-0092 PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS ITS RIGHT THE FEEBLE MINDED AND THE RETARDED CHILD THE PERVERSE CHILD AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CHILD BELONG UNDER THE CARE OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0093 WHICH ARE AT HIS DISPOSAL STILL MORE COMPLEX IS THE CRIMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY REMEDY FOR THE GREATEST SOCIAL CALAMITY IF IT IS PROPOSED SIMPLY TO HYPNOTIZE THE CRIMINAL AND TO SUPPLANT HIS ANTISOCIAL WILL BY A MORAL ONE
1355-39947-0094 AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1355-39947-0095 BUT THE CONCEPTION OF THE BORN CRIMINAL IS ALSO ONLY A LABEL WHICH IS SUPERFICIALLY USED FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF MINDS THAT MEN ARE BORN WITH A BRAIN WHICH NECESSARILY PRODUCES CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS NOT INDICATED BY ANY FACTS
1355-39947-0096 THE VARIETIES WHICH NATURE REALLY PRODUCES ARE BRAINS WHICH ARE MORE LIABLE THAN OTHERS TO PRODUCE ANTISOCIAL ACTIONS WE RECOGNIZED FROM THE START THAT THE ABNORMAL MIND NEVER INTRODUCES ANY NEW ELEMENTS BUT IS CHARACTERIZED ONLY BY A CHANGE OF PROPORTIONS
1355-39947-0097 THERE IS TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF A CERTAIN MENTAL PROCESS AND JUST FOR THAT REASON THERE MUST BE A STEADY AND CONTINUOUS TRANSITION FROM THE NORMAL TO THE ENTIRELY ABNORMAL
32-4137-0000 CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
32-4137-0001 THE BANNER THAT ABOVE THE WAVES IS FLOATING O'ER THREE MILLION SLAVES DICK WALKER THE SLAVE SPECULATOR WHO HAD PURCHASED CURRER AND ALTHESA PUT THEM IN PRISON UNTIL HIS GANG WAS MADE UP
32-4137-0002 AND THEN WITH HIS FORTY SLAVES STARTED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET AS MANY OF THE SLAVES HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN RICHMOND AND HAD RELATIONS RESIDING THERE THE SLAVE TRADER DETERMINED TO LEAVE THE CITY EARLY IN THE MORNING
32-4137-0003 SO AS NOT TO WITNESS ANY OF THOSE SCENES SO COMMON WHERE SLAVES ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHEN ABOUT DEPARTING FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET THIS PLAN WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR NOT EVEN CLOTEL WHO HAD BEEN EVERY DAY AT THE PRISON TO SEE HER MOTHER AND SISTER
32-4137-0004 KNEW OF THEIR DEPARTURE A MARCH OF EIGHT DAYS THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER WHERE THEY WERE ALL PUT ON BOARD A STEAMER AND THEN SPEEDILY SAILED FOR THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION
32-4137-0005 WALKER HAD ALREADY ADVERTISED IN THE NEW ORLEANS PAPERS THAT HE WOULD BE THERE AT A STATED TIME WITH A PRIME LOT OF ABLE BODIED SLAVES READY FOR FIELD SERVICE TOGETHER WITH A FEW EXTRA ONES BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE
32-4137-0006 BUT LIKE MOST WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING SLAVES FOR GAIN HE OFTEN BOUGHT SOME WHO WERE FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AND WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO SELL THEM FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE
32-4137-0007 FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
32-4137-0008 AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS TO GETTING THE NEGROES READY FOR MARKET AMONGST THE FORTY NEGROES WERE SEVERAL WHOSE APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN SOME YEARS AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SERVICES
32-4137-0009 THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
32-4137-0010 AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE DELIGHT IN DISCHARGING HIS DUTY HE DID IT WITH A DEGREE OF ALACRITY SO THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE APPROBATION OF HIS MASTER POMP AS WALKER USUALLY CALLED HIM WAS OF REAL NEGRO BLOOD AND WOULD OFTEN SAY WHEN ALLUDING TO HIMSELF
32-4137-0011 DIS NIGGER IS NO COUNTEFIT HE IS DE GENEWINE ARTEKIL
32-4137-0012 HAD A SET OF TEETH WHICH FOR WHITENESS AND BEAUTY COULD NOT BE SURPASSED HIS EYES LARGE LIPS THICK AND HAIR SHORT AND WOOLLY
32-4137-0013 THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
32-4137-0014 WELL SAID POMPEY ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY I IS DE GENTMAN DAT IS TO GET YOU READY SO DAT YOU WILL BRING MARSER A GOOD PRICE IN DE ORLEANS MARKET HOW OLD IS YOU
32-4137-0015 ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
32-4137-0016 BUT NOW YOU IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD DAT IS WHAT MARSER SAYS YOU IS TO BE I KNOW I IS MORE DEN DAT RESPONDED THE MAN I KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT DAT
32-4137-0017 BUT WHEN YOU GET IN DE MARKET AN ANYBODY AXE YOU HOW OLD YOU IS AN YOU TELL EM FORTY FIVE MARSER WILL TIE YOU UP AN GIB YOU DE WHIP LIKE SMOKE
32-4137-0018 WELL DEN I GUESS I WILL ONLY BE THIRTY WHEN DEY AXE ME REPLIED THE CHATTEL
32-4137-0019 ANSWERED THE MAN OH UNCLE JIM IS IT YES DEN YOU MUST HAVE OFF DEM DARE WHISKERS OF YOURS AN WHEN YOU GET TO ORLEANS YOU MUST GREASE DAT FACE AN MAKE IT LOOK SHINEY
32-4137-0020 I WAS TWENTY NINE LAST POTATO DIGGING TIME SAID THE MAN WHAT'S YOUR NAME MY NAME IS TOBIAS BUT DEY CALL ME TOBY WELL TOBY OR MISTER TOBIAS IF DAT WILL SUIT YOU BETTER
32-4137-0021 YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
32-4137-0022 AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
32-4137-0023 AND EVERYTHING INDICATED THAT A STEAMBOAT RACE WAS AT HAND NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE EXCITEMENT ATTENDANT UPON A STEAMBOAT RACE ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY THE TIME THE BOATS HAD REACHED MEMPHIS THEY WERE SIDE BY SIDE
32-4137-0024 AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
32-4137-0025 ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
32-4137-0026 THE TWO BOATS SOON LOCKED SO THAT THE HANDS OF THE BOATS WERE PASSING FROM VESSEL TO VESSEL AND THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT PREVAILED THROUGHOUT AMONGST BOTH PASSENGERS AND CREW
32-4137-0027 AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
32-4137-0028 THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
32-4137-0029 AND AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED ONE OF THE BOILERS IMMEDIATELY EXPLODED ONE DENSE FOG OF STEAM FILLED EVERY PART OF THE VESSEL WHILE SHRIEKS GROANS AND CRIES WERE HEARD ON EVERY HAND THE SALOONS AND CABINS SOON HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HOSPITAL
32-4137-0030 BY THIS TIME THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE COLUMBIA THE OTHER BOAT
32-4137-0031 THE KILLED AND SCALDED NINETEEN IN NUMBER
32-4137-0032 THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CHANGE HANDS DURING A PASSAGE FROM LOUISVILLE OR SAINT LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER AND MANY MEN AND EVEN LADIES ARE COMPLETELY RUINED GO CALL MY BOY STEWARD
32-4137-0033 SAID MISTER SMITH AS HE TOOK HIS CARDS ONE BY ONE FROM THE TABLE IN A FEW MOMENTS A FINE LOOKING BRIGHT EYED MULATTO BOY APPARENTLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS STANDING BY HIS MASTER'S SIDE AT THE TABLE
32-4137-0034 I WILL SEE YOU AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BETTER SAID SMITH AS HIS SERVANT JERRY APPROACHED THE TABLE
32-4137-0035 HE WILL BRING A THOUSAND DOLLARS ANY DAY IN THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET REPLIED SMITH THEN YOU BET THE WHOLE OF THE BOY DO YOU YES I CALL YOU THEN SAID JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SPREADING HIS CARDS OUT UPON THE TABLE
32-4137-0036 YOU HAVE BEAT ME SAID SMITH AS SOON AS HE SAW THE CARDS JERRY WHO WAS STANDING ON TOP OF THE TABLE WITH THE BANK NOTES AND SILVER DOLLARS ROUND HIS FEET WAS NOW ORDERED TO DESCEND FROM THE TABLE
32-4137-0037 YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT YOU BELONG TO ME SAID JOHNSON AS THE YOUNG SLAVE WAS STEPPING FROM THE TABLE TO A CHAIR NO SIR REPLIED THE CHATTEL
32-4137-0038 YES SIR RESPONDED JERRY AS HE WIPED THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES SMITH TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE BILL OF SALE AND HANDED IT TO JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SAYING
32-4137-0039 I CLAIM THE RIGHT OF REDEEMING THAT BOY MISTER JOHNSON MY FATHER GAVE HIM TO ME WHEN I CAME OF AGE AND I PROMISED NOT TO PART WITH HIM MOST CERTAINLY SIR THE BOY SHALL BE YOURS WHENEVER YOU HAND ME OVER A COOL THOUSAND REPLIED JOHNSON
32-4137-0040 THE NEXT MORNING AS THE PASSENGERS WERE ASSEMBLING IN THE BREAKFAST SALOONS AND UPON THE GUARDS OF THE VESSEL AND THE SERVANTS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT WAITING UPON OR LOOKING FOR THEIR MASTERS POOR JERRY WAS ENTERING HIS NEW MASTER'S STATEROOM WITH HIS BOOTS
32-4137-0041 WHO DO YOU BELONG TO SAID A GENTLEMAN TO AN OLD BLACK MAN
32-4137-0042 WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
32-4137-0043 HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
32-4137-0044 TO BEHOLD FIVE OR SIX TABLES IN A STEAMBOAT'S CABIN WITH HALF A DOZEN MEN PLAYING AT CARDS AND MONEY PISTOLS BOWIE KNIVES ALL IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLES IS WHAT MAY BE SEEN AT ALMOST ANY TIME ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ON THE FOURTH DAY WHILE AT NATCHEZ
32-4137-0045 TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN
32-4137-0046 I WANT A GOOD TRUSTY WOMAN FOR HOUSE SERVICE SAID THE STRANGER AS THEY ENTERED THE CABIN WHERE WALKER'S SLAVES WERE KEPT HERE SHE IS AND NO MISTAKE REPLIED THE TRADER STAND UP CURRER MY GAL HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WISHES TO SEE IF YOU WILL SUIT HIM
32-4137-0047 SHE IS A RARE COOK A GOOD WASHER AND WILL SUIT YOU TO A T I AM SURE IF YOU BUY ME I HOPE YOU WILL BUY MY DAUGHTER TOO SAID THE WOMAN IN RATHER AN EXCITED MANNER
32-4137-0048 I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
32-4137-0049 AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
32-4137-0050 ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE BOAT AT BATON ROUGE AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN ON BOARD AND AMONGST THEM SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN ATTENDING THE RACES GAMBLING AND DRINKING WERE NOW THE ORDER OF THE DAY
32-4137-0051 WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
32-4137-0052 AND ONE OF THE PARTY SEIZED HIS PISTOL AND FIRED BUT FORTUNATELY THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WAS KNOCKED UP JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED AND THE BALL PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER DECK INSTEAD OF THE MAN'S HEAD AS INTENDED ORDER WAS SOON RESTORED
32-4137-0053 ALL WENT ON WELL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THE BOAT ARRIVED AT NEW ORLEANS
32-4137-0054 OUR EYES ARE YET ON AFRIC'S SHORES HER THOUSAND WRONGS WE STILL DEPLORE WE SEE THE GRIM SLAVE TRADER THERE WE HEAR HIS FETTERED VICTIM'S PRAYER AND HASTEN TO THE SUFFERER'S AID
32-4137-0055 FORGETFUL OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THE OCEAN PIRATE'S FIEND LIKE FORM SHALL SINK BENEATH THE VENGEANCE STORM HIS HEART OF STEEL SHALL QUAKE BEFORE THE BATTLE DIN AND HAVOC ROAR
32-4137-0056 THE KNAVE SHALL DIE THE LAW HATH SAID WHILE IT PROTECTS OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE WHAT EARTHLY EYE PRESUMES TO SCAN THE WILY PROTEUS HEART OF MAN WHAT POTENT HAND WILL E'ER UNROLL
32-4137-0057 THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
32-4137-0058 SHALL YET ASSAIL AND REND DISSIMULATION'S VEIL
32-21631-0000 AFTER MISTER CROW FLEW BACK TO PLEASANT VALLEY TO GATHER NEWS FOR HIM BROWNIE BEAVER CAREFULLY COUNTED EACH DAY THAT PASSED SINCE MISTER CROW HAD AGREED TO BE HIS NEWSPAPER AND COME EACH SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING THE WEEK
32-21631-0001 BROWNIE WAS IN A GREAT HURRY FOR SATURDAY TO ARRIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE NO MISTAKE HE PUT ASIDE A STICK IN WHICH HE GNAWED A NOTCH EACH DAY AND IN THAT WAY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHEN SATURDAY CAME
32-21631-0002 THAT WAS PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY IN BROWNIE BEAVER'S LIFE AT LEAST IT SEEMED SO TO HIM WHENEVER HE SAW A BIRD SOARING ABOVE THE TREE TOPS HE COULDN'T HELP HOPING IT WAS MISTER CROW
32-21631-0003 BROWNIE BEAVER DROPPED WHATEVER HE HAPPENED TO BE DOING EXPECTING THAT MISTER CROW WOULD FLAP INTO SIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BROWNIE HAD MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MISTER CROW REALLY CAME AT LAST
32-21631-0004 HE LIGHTED RIGHT ON TOP OF BROWNIE BEAVER'S HOUSE AND CALLED PAPER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT BROWNIE HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED
32-21631-0005 ABOVE THE WATER AND HE SOON CRAWLED UP BESIDE MISTER CROW WELL I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HE TOLD MISTER CROW PETER MINK CAUGHT A MONSTROUS EEL IN THE DUCK POND ON MONDAY MISTER CROW SAID

32-21631-0007 MISTER CROW CONTINUED TO RELATE IN A SINGSONG VOICE GOODNESS GRACIOUS BROWNIE BEAVER EXCLAIMED FATTY COON MISTER CROW SAID FATTY COON WAS CONFINED TO HIS HOUSE BY ILLNESS TUESDAY NIGHT
32-21631-0008 HE ATE TOO MANY DRIED APPLES WELL WELL BROWNIE BEAVER MURMURED AND HE STARTED TO ASK MISTER CROW A QUESTION BUT MISTER CROW INTERRUPTED HIM WITH MORE NEWS
32-21631-0009 MISSUS BEAR HAD A BIRTHDAY ON WEDNESDAY AN ENJOYABLE TIME WAS HAD BY ALL EXCEPT THE PIG PIG BROWNIE BEAVER ASKED WHAT PIG THE PIG THEY ATE SAID MISTER CROW

32-21631-0012 AND HE LEFT FASTER THAN HE CAME BROWNIE BEAVER WANTED TO KNOW WHERE TOMMY FOX MADE HIS VISIT AT FARMER GREEN'S HEN HOUSE MISTER CROW EXPLAINED WHY DID HE HURRY AWAY BROWNIE ASKED
32-21631-0013 OLD DOG SPOT CHASED HIM MISTER CROW REPLIED BUT YOU MUSTN'T ASK QUESTIONS HE COMPLAINED YOU CAN'T ASK QUESTIONS OF A NEWSPAPER YOU KNOW WELL WHAT HAPPENED ON SATURDAY

32-21631-0016 HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE SAID ANOTHER WORD MISTER CROW WOULD GROW ANGRY AND FLY AWAY WITHOUT TELLING HIM ANY MORE NEWS
32-21631-0017 JIMMY RABBIT ALMOST CUT OFF FRISKY SQUIRREL'S TAIL MISTER CROW PAUSED AND LOOKED AT BROWNIE BEAVER OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE KNEW THAT BROWNIE WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT PREVENTED THE ACCIDENT BUT HE WAS IN NO HURRY TO TELL HIM
32-21631-0018 FOR A FEW MOMENTS BROWNIE WAITED TO HEAR THE REST BUT A FEW MOMENTS WAS MORE THAN HE COULD ENDURE WHY DIDN'T JIMMY CUT OFF HIS TAIL BROWNIE ASKED EAGERLY THERE SAID MISTER CROW YOU'VE DONE JUST AS I TOLD YOU NOT TO
32-21631-0019 SO I SHALL NOT TELL YOU THE REST UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY YOU SEE YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TAKING A NEWSPAPER
32-21634-0000 THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE POND WHEN BROWNIE BEAVER RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HUNTING AND FISHING AND WHEN OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER SAID THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO TAKE A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
32-21634-0001 ALL THE VILLAGERS SAID IT WAS A FINE IDEA SO THEY STOPPED WORKING FOR ONCE AND BEGAN TO PLAN THE CELEBRATION THEY THOUGHT THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SWIMMING RACES AND TREE FELLING CONTESTS
32-21634-0002 AND BROWNIE BEAVER SAID THAT AFTER THE HOLIDAY WAS OVER HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE BE CHOSEN TO GO DOWN AND THANK FARMER GREEN FOR PUTTING THE NOTICE ON THE TREE THE WHOLE VILLAGE AGREED TO BROWNIE'S PROPOSAL
32-21634-0003 BROWNIE BEAVER HIMSELF PASSED HIS HAT AROUND TO TAKE UP THE VOTES AND IT WAS QUICKLY FOUND THAT EVERY VOTE WAS FOR BROWNIE BEAVER HE HAD EVEN VOTED FOR HIMSELF BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT THAT
32-21634-0004 AND ANOTHER IN WHICH EACH PERSON WHO TOOK PART HAD TO STAY BENEATH THE SURFACE AS LONG AS HE COULD THAT LAST RACE CAUSED SOME TROUBLE A YOUNG SCAMP CALLED SLIPPERY SAM WON IT AND MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SWUM UP INSIDE HIS HOUSE
32-21634-0005 WHERE HE COULD GET AIR WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT NO ONE COULD PROVE IT SO HE WON THE RACE JUST THE SAME NEXT CAME THE TREE FELLING CONTEST THERE WERE SIX INCLUDING BROWNIE BEAVER THAT TOOK PART IN IT
32-21634-0006 GRANDADDY BEAVER HAD PICKED OUT SIX TREES OF EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE EACH PERSON IN THE CONTEST HAD TO TRY TO BRING HIS TREE TO THE GROUND FIRST AND THAT CAUSED SOME TROUBLE TOO BECAUSE SOME CLAIMED THAT THEIR TREES WERE OF HARDER WOOD THAN OTHERS
32-21634-0007 AND MORE DIFFICULT TO GNAW WHILE OTHERS COMPLAINED THAT THE BARK OF THEIR TREES TASTED VERY BITTER AND OF COURSE THAT MADE THEIR TASK UNPLEASANT THOSE SIX TREES FALLING ONE AFTER ANOTHER MADE SUCH A RACKET
32-21634-0008 THAT OLD MISTER CROW HEARD THE NOISE MILES AWAY AND FLEW OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AFTER EVERYBODY CREPT OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE SOME TIME AFTERWARD EVERYONE HAD TO HIDE FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW
32-21634-0009 THERE WAS MISTER CROW SITTING UPON ONE OF THE FALLEN TREES
32-21634-0010 THEN THEY TOLD HIM ABOUT THE CELEBRATION AND MISTER CROW BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NEXT HE ASKED WE'RE A GOING TO SEND BROWNIE BEAVER OVER TO PLEASANT VALLEY
32-21634-0011 TO THANK FARMER GREEN FOR HIS KINDNESS IN PUTTING AN END TO HUNTING AND FISHING SAID OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER AND HE'S A GOING TO START RIGHT AWAY MISTER CROW LOOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21634-0012 WITH A LUNCH BASKET IN HIS HAND ALL READY TO BEGIN HIS LONG JOURNEY SAY GOOD BY TO HIM THEN SAID MISTER CROW FOR YOU'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN GRANDADDY BEAVER ASKED
32-21634-0013 AND AS FOR BROWNIE HE WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE DROPPED HIS BASKET RIGHT IN THE WATER I MEAN SAID MISTER CROW
32-21634-0014 YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT SIGN IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS NOT FARMER GREEN BUT HIS SON JOHNNIE WHO NAILED IT TO THE TREE
32-21634-0015 THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE WORDS WAS MISSPELLED NO DOUBT MISTER CROW REMARKED AS A MATTER OF FACT NOT BEING ABLE TO READ HE HADN'T KNOWN ABOUT THE WORD THAT WAS SPELLED WRONG IN THE SECOND PLACE HE CONTINUED
32-21634-0016 THE SIGN DOESN'T MEAN THAT HUNTING AND FISHING ARE TO BE STOPPED IT MEANS THAT NO ONE BUT JOHNNIE GREEN IS GOING TO HUNT AND FISH IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
32-21634-0017 AND INSTEAD OF HUNTING AND FISHING BEING STOPPED
32-21634-0018 HE ADDED THAT JOHNNIE GREEN HAD A NEW GUN ON THIS BIRTHDAY BROWNIE BEAVER SAID AT ONCE THAT HE WAS NOT GOING ON THE ERRAND OF THANKS I RESIGN HE SAID AND ANYONE THAT WANTS TO GO IN MY PLACE IS WELCOME TO DO SO
32-21634-0019 BUT NOBODY CARED TO GO AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE SEEMED GREATLY DISAPPOINTED UNTIL GRANDADDY BEAVER MADE A SHORT SPEECH
2952-410-0000 ALL THE CAPACITIES OF A DARING AND SKILLFUL SOLDIER
2952-410-0001 BUT AS HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT DISTINCTION FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALONE AND AS HIS HEART REMAINED TRUE TO HIS FORMER LORD HE PREFERRED TO GIVE UP THE WORLD SO HE CUT OFF HIS HAIR AND BECAME A TRAVELING PRIEST TAKING THE BUDDHIST NAME OF KWAIRYO
2952-410-0002 AS IN OTHER YEARS HE HAD LAUGHED AT PERIL SO NOW ALSO HE SCORNED DANGER
2952-410-0003 SO HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER THE STARS AND HAVING FOUND A SUITABLE GRASSY SPOT BY THE ROADSIDE HE LAY DOWN THERE AND PREPARED TO SLEEP
2952-410-0004 HE HAD ALWAYS WELCOMED DISCOMFORT AND EVEN A BARE ROCK WAS FOR HIM A GOOD BED WHEN NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND AND THE ROOT OF A PINE TREE AN EXCELLENT PILLOW HIS BODY WAS IRON AND HE NEVER TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT DEWS OR RAIN OR FROST OR SNOW
2952-410-0005 SCARCELY HAD HE LAIN DOWN WHEN A MAN CAME ALONG THE ROAD CARRYING AN AXE AND A GREAT BUNDLE OF CHOPPED WOOD THIS WOODCUTTER HALTED ON SEEING KWAIRYO LYING DOWN
2952-410-0006 AND AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENT OBSERVATION SAID TO HIM IN A TONE OF GREAT SURPRISE WHAT KIND OF A MAN CAN YOU BE GOOD SIR THAT YOU DARE TO LIE DOWN ALONE IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THERE ARE HAUNTERS ABOUT HERE MANY OF THEM ARE YOU NOT AFRAID OF HAIRY THINGS
2952-410-0007 MY FRIEND CHEERFULLY ANSWERED KWAIRYO I AM ONLY A WANDERING PRIEST A CLOUD AND WATER GUEST AS FOLKS CALL IT
2952-410-0008 AS FOR LONESOME PLACES I LIKE THEM THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR MEDITATION I AM ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPING IN THE OPEN AIR AND I HAVE LEARNED NEVER TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT MY LIFE
2952-410-0009 TO LIE DOWN HERE THIS PLACE HAS A BAD NAME A VERY BAD NAME BUT AS THE PROVERB HAS IT KUNSHI AYAYUKI NI CHIKAYORAZU THE SUPERIOR MAN DOES NOT NEEDLESSLY EXPOSE HIMSELF TO PERIL
2952-410-0010 AND I MUST ASSURE YOU SIR THAT IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SLEEP HERE THEREFORE ALTHOUGH MY HOUSE IS ONLY A WRETCHED THATCHED HUT LET ME BEG OF YOU TO COME HOME WITH ME AT ONCE IN THE WAY OF FOOD I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER YOU BUT THERE IS A ROOF AT LEAST AND YOU CAN SLEEP UNDER IT WITHOUT RISK
2952-410-0011 ACCEPTED THIS MODEST OFFER THE WOODCUTTER GUIDED HIM ALONG A NARROW PATH LEADING UP FROM THE MAIN ROAD THROUGH MOUNTAIN FOREST IT WAS A ROUGH AND DANGEROUS PATH SOMETIMES SKIRTING PRECIPICES SOMETIMES OFFERING NOTHING BUT A NETWORK OF
2952-410-0012 SLIPPERY ROOTS FOR THE FOOT TO REST UPON SOMETIMES WINDING OVER OR BETWEEN MASSES OF JAGGED ROCK BUT AT LAST KWAIRYO FOUND HIMSELF UPON A CLEARED SPACE AT THE TOP OF A HILL WITH A FULL MOON SHINING OVERHEAD AND HE SAW BEFORE HIM A SMALL THATCHED COTTAGE
2952-410-0013 AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY SOME ONE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RULES OF PROPRIETY THEN TURNING TO HIS HOST THE ARUJI OR HOUSE MASTER AS THE OTHERS CALLED HIM KWAIRYO SAID
2952-410-0014 FROM THE KINDNESS OF YOUR SPEECH AND FROM THE VERY POLITE WELCOME GIVEN ME BY YOUR HOUSEHOLD I IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN A WOODCUTTER PERHAPS YOU FORMERLY BELONGED TO ONE OF THE UPPER CLASSES SMILING THE WOODCUTTER ANSWERED SIR YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN
2952-410-0015 THOUGH NOW LIVING AS YOU FIND ME I WAS ONCE A PERSON OF SOME DISTINCTION MY STORY IS THE STORY OF A RUINED LIFE RUINED BY MY OWN FAULT I USED TO BE IN THE SERVICE OF A DAIMYO AND MY RANK IN THAT SERVICE WAS NOT INCONSIDERABLE
2952-410-0016 BUT I LOVED WOMEN AND WINE TOO WELL AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION I ACTED WICKEDLY
2952-410-0017 RETRIBUTION FOLLOWED ME AND I LONG REMAINED A FUGITIVE IN THE LAND NOW I OFTEN PRAY THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME ATONEMENT FOR THE EVIL WHICH I DID AND TO REESTABLISH THE ANCESTRAL HOME BUT I FEAR THAT I SHALL NEVER FIND ANY WAY OF SO DOING
2952-410-0018 KWAIRYO WAS PLEASED BY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOOD RESOLVE AND HE SAID TO THE ARUJI MY FRIEND I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO OBSERVE THAT MAN PRONE TO FOLLY IN THEIR YOUTH MAY IN AFTER YEARS BECOME VERY EARNEST IN RIGHT LIVING
2952-410-0019 IN THE HOLY SUTRAS IT IS WRITTEN THAT THOSE STRONGEST IN WRONG DOING CAN BECOME BY POWER OF GOOD RESOLVE THE STRONGEST IN RIGHT DOING I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART AND I HOPE THAT BETTER FORTUNE WILL COME TO YOU
2952-410-0020 TO NIGHT I SHALL RECITE THE SUTRAS FOR YOUR SAKE AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN THE FORCE TO OVERCOME THE KARMA OF ANY PAST ERRORS WITH THESE ASSURANCES KWAIRYO BADE THE ARUJI GOOD NIGHT AND HIS HOST SHOWED HIM TO A VERY SMALL SIDE ROOM WHERE A BED HAD BEEN MADE READY
2952-410-0021 THEN ALL WENT TO SLEEP EXCEPT THE PRIEST WHO BEGAN TO READ THE SUTRAS BY THE LIGHT OF A PAPER LANTERN UNTIL A LATE HOUR HE CONTINUED TO READ AND PRAY
2952-410-0022 THE NIGHT WAS BEAUTIFUL THERE WAS NO CLOUD IN THE SKY THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE STRONG MOONLIGHT THREW DOWN SHARP BLACK SHADOWS OF FOLIAGE AND GLITTERED ON THE DEWS OF THE GARDEN
2952-410-0023 AND THE SOUND OF THE NEIGHBORING CASCADE DEEPENED WITH THE NIGHT KWAIRYO FELT THIRSTY AS HE LISTENED TO THE NOISE OF THE WATER AND REMEMBERING THE BAMBOO AQUEDUCT AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GO THERE AND GET A DRINK WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SLEEPING HOUSEHOLD
2952-410-0024 VERY GENTLY HE PUSHED APART THE SLIDING SCREENS THAT SEPARATED HIS ROOM FROM THE MAIN APARTMENT AND HE SAW BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN FIVE RECUMBENT BODIES WITHOUT HEADS
2952-410-0025 FOR ONE INSTANT HE STOOD BEWILDERED IMAGINING A CRIME BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NO BLOOD AND THAT THE HEADLESS NECKS DID NOT LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT THEN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0026 AND REMOVE THE BODY TO ANOTHER PLACE THE HEAD WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO JOIN ITSELF AGAIN TO THE NECK AND THE BOOK FURTHER SAYS THAT WHEN THE HEAD COMES BACK AND FINDS THAT ITS BODY HAS BEEN MOVED IT WILL STRIKE ITSELF UPON THE FLOOR THREE TIMES BOUNDING LIKE A BALL AND WILL PANT AS IN GREAT FEAR
2952-410-0027 AND PRESENTLY DIE NOW IF THESE BE ROKURO KUBI THEY MEAN ME NO GOOD SO I SHALL BE JUSTIFIED IN FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE BOOK HE SEIZED THE BODY OF THE ARUJI BY THE FEET PULLED IT TO THE WINDOW AND PUSHED IT OUT
2952-410-0028 GENTLY UNBARRING THE DOOR HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE GARDEN AND PROCEEDED WITH ALL POSSIBLE CAUTION TO THE GROVE BEYOND IT HE HEARD VOICES TALKING IN THE GROVE AND HE WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICES STEALING FROM SHADOW TO SHADOW UNTIL HE REACHED A GOOD HIDING PLACE
2952-410-0029 THEN FROM BEHIND A TRUNK HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE HEADS ALL FIVE OF THEM FLITTING ABOUT AND CHATTING AS THEY FLITTED THEY WERE EATING WORMS AND INSECTS WHICH THEY FOUND ON THE GROUND OR AMONG THE TREES
2952-410-0030 PRESENTLY THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI STOPPED EATING AND SAID AH THAT TRAVELING PRIEST WHO CAME TO NIGHT HOW FAT ALL HIS BODY IS WHEN WE SHALL HAVE EATEN HIM OUR BELLIES WILL BE WELL FILLED I WAS FOOLISH TO TALK TO HIM AS I DID
2952-410-0031 TO GO NEAR HIM WHILE HE IS RECITING WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND WE CANNOT TOUCH HIM SO LONG AS HE IS PRAYING BUT AS IT IS NOW NEARLY MORNING PERHAPS HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP SOME ONE OF YOU GO TO THE HOUSE AND SEE WHAT THE FELLOW IS DOING
2952-410-0032 ANOTHER HEAD THE HEAD OF A YOUNG WOMAN IMMEDIATELY ROSE UP AND FLITTED TO THE HOUSE LIGHTLY AS A BAT AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT CAME BACK AND CRIED OUT HUSKILY IN A TONE OF GREAT ALARM THAT TRAVELING PRIEST IS NOT IN THE HOUSE HE IS GONE BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST OF THE MATTER
2952-410-0033 HE HAS TAKEN THE BODY OF OUR ARUJI AND I DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE HAS PUT IT AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI DISTINCTLY VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT ASSUMED A FRIGHTFUL ASPECT ITS EYES OPENED MONSTROUSLY ITS HAIR STOOD UP BRISTLING AND ITS TEETH GNASHED
2952-410-0034 SINCE MY BODY HAS BEEN MOVED TO REJOIN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN I MUST DIE AND ALL THROUGH THE WORK OF THAT PRIEST
2952-410-0035 AND THERE HE IS BEHIND THAT TREE HIDING BEHIND THAT TREE SEE HIM THE FAT COWARD IN THE SAME MOMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER FOUR HEADS SPRANG AT KWAIRYO
2952-410-0036 BUT THE STRONG PRIEST HAD ALREADY ARMED HIMSELF BY PLUCKING UP A YOUNG TREE AND WITH THAT TREE HE STRUCK THE HEADS AS THEY CAME KNOCKING THEM FROM HIM WITH TREMENDOUS BLOWS FOUR OF THEM FLED AWAY BUT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI THOUGH BATTERED AGAIN AND AGAIN DESPERATELY CONTINUED TO BOUND AT THE PRIEST
2952-410-0037 AND AT LAST CAUGHT HIM BY THE LEFT SLEEVE OF HIS ROBE KWAIRYO HOWEVER AS QUICKLY GRIPPED THE HEAD BY ITS TOPKNOT AND REPEATEDLY STRUCK IT IT DID NOT RELEASE ITS HOLD BUT IT UTTERED A LONG MOAN AND THEREAFTER CEASED TO STRUGGLE IT WAS DEAD
2952-410-0038 BUT ITS TEETH STILL HELD THE SLEEVE AND FOR ALL HIS GREAT STRENGTH KWAIRYO COULD NOT FORCE OPEN THE JAWS WITH THE HEAD STILL HANGING TO HIS SLEEVE HE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND THERE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE OTHER FOUR ROKURO KUBI SQUATTING TOGETHER
2952-410-0039 WITH THEIR BRUISED AND BLEEDING HEADS REUNITED TO THEIR BODIES BUT WHEN THEY PERCEIVED HIM AT THE BACK DOOR ALL SCREAMED THE PRIEST THE PRIEST AND FLED THROUGH THE OTHER DOORWAY OUT INTO THE WOODS EASTWARD THE SKY WAS BRIGHTENING DAY WAS ABOUT TO DAWN
2952-410-0040 AND KWAIRYO KNEW THAT THE POWER OF THE GOBLINS WAS LIMITED TO THE HOURS OF DARKNESS HE LOOKED AT THE HEAD CLINGING TO HIS SLEEVE ITS FACE ALL FOULED WITH BLOOD AND FOAM AND CLAY AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD AS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0041 AFTER WHICH HE GATHERED TOGETHER HIS FEW BELONGINGS AND LEISURELY DESCENDED THE MOUNTAIN TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY RIGHT ON HE JOURNEYED UNTIL HE CAME TO SUWA
2952-410-0042 SEIZED THE PRIEST AND TOOK HIM TO JAIL FOR THEY SUPPOSED THE HEAD TO BE THE HEAD OF A MURDERED MAN WHO IN THE MOMENT OF BEING KILLED HAD CAUGHT THE MURDERER'S SLEEVE IN HIS TEETH AS THE KWAIRYO HE ONLY SMILED AND SAID NOTHING WHEN THEY QUESTIONED HIM
2952-410-0043 SO AFTER HAVING PASSED A NIGHT IN PRISON HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES OF THE DISTRICT THEN HE WAS ORDERED TO EXPLAIN HOW HE A PRIEST HAD BEEN FOUND WITH THE HEAD OF A MAN FASTENED TO HIS SLEEVE AND WHY HE HAD DARED THUS SHAMELESSLY TO PARADE HIS CRIME IN THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE
2952-410-0044 KWAIRYO LAUGHED LONG AND LOUDLY AT THESE QUESTIONS AND THEN HE SAID SIRS I DID NOT FASTEN THE HEAD TO MY SLEEVE IT FASTENED ITSELF THERE MUCH AGAINST MY WILL AND I HAVE NOT COMMITTED ANY CRIME FOR THIS IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN IT IS THE HEAD OF A GOBLIN
2952-410-0045 BUT THE MAGISTRATES DID NOT LAUGH THEY JUDGED HIM TO BE A HARDENED CRIMINAL AND HIS STORY AN INSULT TO THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEREFORE WITHOUT FURTHER QUESTIONING THEY DECIDED TO ORDER HIS IMMEDIATE EXECUTION ALL OF THEM EXCEPT ONE
2952-410-0046 A VERY OLD MAN THIS AGED OFFICER HAD MADE NO REMARK DURING THE TRIAL BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD THE OPINION OF HIS COLLEAGUES HE ROSE UP AND SAID LET US FIRST EXAMINE THE HEAD CAREFULLY FOR THIS I THINK HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE
2952-410-0047 THE OLD MAN TURNED IT ROUND AND ROUND CAREFULLY EXAMINED IT AND DISCOVERED ON THE NAPE OF ITS NECK SEVERAL STRANGE RED CHARACTERS HE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF HIS COLLEAGUES TO THESE AND ALSO BADE THEM OBSERVE THAT THE EDGES OF THE NECK NOWHERE PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN CUT BY ANY WEAPON
2952-410-0048 ON THE CONTRARY THE LINE OF LEVERANCE WAS SMOOTH AS THE LINE AT WHICH A FALLING LEAF DETACHES ITSELF FROM THE STEM THEN SAID THE ELDER I AM QUITE SURE THAT THE PRIEST TOLD US NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH THIS IS THE HEAD OF A ROKURO KUBI
2952-410-0049 THERE ARE THE CHARACTERS YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELVES THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAINTED MOREOVER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SUCH GOBLINS HAVE BEEN DWELLING IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE PROVINCE OF KAI FROM VERY ANCIENT TIME BUT YOU SIR HE EXCLAIMED TURNING TO KWAIRYO
2952-410-0050 PERHAPS YOU ONCE BELONGED TO THE SAMURAI CLASS
2952-410-0051 BEFORE BECOMING A PRIEST I LONG FOLLOWED THE PROFESSION OF ARMS AND IN THOSE DAYS I NEVER FEARED MAN OR DEVIL MY NAME THEN WAS ISOGAI HEIDAZAEMON TAKETSURA OF KYUSHU THERE MAY BE SOME AMONG YOU WHO REMEMBER IT
2952-410-0052 AT THE MENTION OF THAT NAME A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION FILLED THE COURT ROOM FOR THERE WERE MANY PRESENT WHO REMEMBERED IT AND KWAIRYO IMMEDIATELY FOUND HIMSELF AMONG FRIENDS INSTEAD OF JUDGES FRIENDS ANXIOUS TO PROVE THEIR ADMIRATION BY FRATERNAL KINDNESS
2952-410-0053 WHEN KWAIRYO LEFT SUWA HE WAS AS HAPPY AS ANY PRIEST IS PERMITTED TO BE IN THIS TRANSITORY WORLD AS FOR THE HEAD HE TOOK IT WITH HIM JOCOSELY INSISTING THAT HE INTENDED IT FOR A MIYAGE AND NOW IT ONLY REMAINS TO TELL WHAT BECAME OF THE HEAD
2952-410-0054 A DAY OR TWO AFTER LEAVING SUWA KWAIRYO MET WITH A ROBBER WHO STOPPED HIM IN A LONESOME PLACE AND BADE HIM STRIP KWAIRYO AT ONCE REMOVED HIS KOROMO AND OFFERED IT TO THE ROBBER WHO THEN FIRST PERCEIVED WHAT WAS HANGING TO THE SLEEVE
2952-410-0055 THOUGH BRAVE THE HIGHWAYMAN WAS STARTLED HE DROPPED THE GARMENT AND SPRANG BACK THEN HE CRIED OUT YOU
2952-410-0056 KWAIRYO ANSWERED I SHALL LET YOU HAVE THE HEAD AND THE ROBE IF YOU INSIST BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN IT IS A GOBLIN'S HEAD SO IF YOU BUY IT AND HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE PLEASE TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE NOT DECEIVED BY ME
2952-410-0057 WHAT A NICE PRIEST YOU ARE EXCLAIMED THE ROBBER YOU KILL MEN AND JEST ABOUT IT BUT I AM REALLY IN EARNEST HERE IS MY ROBE AND HERE IS THE MONEY AND LET ME HAVE THE HEAD WHAT IS THE USE OF JOKING
2952-410-0058 TAKE THE THING SAID KWAIRYO I WAS NOT JOKING
2952-410-0059 AND HE THEN BECAME AFRAID THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE ROKURO KUBI MIGHT GIVE HIM TROUBLE SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE BACK THE HEAD TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD COME AND TO BURY IT WITH ITS BODY HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE LONELY COTTAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF KAI BUT NOBODY WAS THERE
2952-410-0060 AND HE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE BODY THEREFORE HE BURIED THE HEAD BY ITSELF IN THE GROVE BEHIND THE COTTAGE AND HE HAD A TOMBSTONE SET UP OVER THE GRAVE AND HE CAUSED A SEGAKI SERVICE TO BE PERFORMED ON BEHALF OF THE SPIRIT OF THE ROKURO KUBI
2952-408-0000 JIKININKI ONCE WHEN MUSO KOKUSHI
2952-408-0001 FOR A LONG TIME HE WANDERED ABOUT HELPLESSLY AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO DESPAIR OF FINDING SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT WHEN HE PERCEIVED ON THE TOP OF A HILL LIGHTED BY THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE HERMITAGES CALLED
2952-408-0002 WHICH ARE BUILT FOR SOLITARY PRIESTS IT SEEMED TO BE IN RUINOUS CONDITION BUT HE HASTENED TO IT EAGERLY AND FOUND THAT IT WAS INHABITED BY AN AGED PRIEST FROM WHOM HE BEGGED THE FAVOR OF A NIGHT'S LODGING
2952-408-0003 THIS THE OLD MAN HARSHLY REFUSED BUT HE DIRECTED MUSO TO A CERTAIN HAMLET IN THE VALLEY ADJOINING WHERE LODGING AND FOOD COULD BE OBTAINED MUSO FOUND HIS WAY TO THE HAMLET WHICH CONSISTED OF LESS THAN A DOZEN FARM COTTAGES
2952-408-0004 BUT A LITTLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT HE WAS ROUSED FROM SLEEP BY A SOUND OF LOUD WEEPING IN THE NEXT APARTMENT PRESENTLY THE SLIDING SCREENS WERE GENTLY PUSHED APART AND A YOUNG MAN CARRYING A LIGHTED LANTERN ENTERED THE ROOM RESPECTFULLY SALUTED HIM AND SAID
2952-408-0005 THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU SAW IN THE NEXT ROOM ARE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VILLAGE
2952-408-0006 STRANGE THINGS ALWAYS HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE WHERE A CORPSE HAS THUS BEEN LEFT SO WE THINK THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO COME AWAY WITH US WE CAN FIND YOU GOOD LODGING IN THE OTHER VILLAGE
2952-408-0007 BUT I AM SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT TELL ME OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH WHEN I CAME FOR THOUGH I WAS A LITTLE TIRED I CERTAINLY WAS NOT SO TIRED THAT I SHOULD HAVE FOUND DIFFICULTY IN DOING MY DUTY AS A PRIEST HAD YOU TOLD ME I COULD HAVE PERFORMED THE SERVICE BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
2952-408-0008 AS IT IS I SHALL PERFORM THE SERVICE AFTER YOU HAVE GONE AWAY AND I SHALL STAY BY THE BODY UNTIL MORNING I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY YOUR WORDS ABOUT THE DANGER OF STAYING HERE ALONE
2952-408-0009 THEN THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY AND THE FOLK ASSEMBLED IN THE ADJOINING ROOM HAVING BEEN TOLD OF THE PRIEST'S KIND PROMISES CAME TO THANK HIM AFTER WHICH THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID NOW REVEREND SIR MUCH AS WE REGRET TO LEAVE YOU ALONE WE MUST BID YOU FAREWELL
2952-408-0010 BY THE RULE OF OUR VILLAGE NONE OF US CAN STAY HERE AFTER MIDNIGHT WE BEG KIND SIR THAT YOU WILL TAKE EVERY CARE OF YOUR HONORABLE BODY WHILE WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND UPON YOU AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING STRANGE DURING OUR ABSENCE PLEASE TELL US OF THE MATTER WHEN WE RETURN IN THE MORNING
2952-408-0011 ALL THEN LEFT THE HOUSE EXCEPT THE PRIEST WHO WENT TO THE ROOM WHERE THE DEAD BODY WAS LYING THE USUAL OFFERINGS HAD BEEN SET BEFORE THE CORPSE AND A SMALL BUDDHIST LAMP TOMYO WAS BURNING
2952-408-0012 THE PRIEST RECITED THE SERVICE AND PERFORMED THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES AFTER WHICH HE ENTERED INTO MEDITATION SO MEDITATING HE REMAINED THROUGH SEVERAL SILENT HOURS AND THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE DESERTED VILLAGE
2952-408-0013 BUT WHEN THE HUSH OF THE NIGHT WAS AT ITS DEEPEST THERE NOISELESSLY ENTERED A SHAPE VAGUE AND VAST AND IN THE SAME MOMENT MUSO FOUND HIMSELF WITHOUT POWER TO MOVE OR SPEAK
2952-408-0014 HE SAW THAT SHAPE LIFT THE CORPSE AS WITH HANDS DEVOUR IT MORE QUICKLY THAN A CAT DEVOURS A RAT BEGINNING AT THE HEAD AND EATING EVERYTHING THE HAIR AND THE BONES AND EVEN THE SHROUD AND THE MONSTROUS THING HAVING THUS CONSUMED THE BODY
2952-408-0015 TURNED TO THE OFFERINGS AND ATE THEM ALSO THEN IT WENT AWAY AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS IT HAD COME WHEN THE VILLAGERS RETURNED NEXT MORNING THEY FOUND THE PRIEST AWAITING THEM AT THE DOOR OF THE HEADMAN'S DWELLING ALL IN TURN SALUTED HIM AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED
2952-408-0016 AND LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM NO ONE EXPRESSED ANY SURPRISE AT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DEAD BODY AND THE OFFERINGS BUT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID TO MUSO REVERENT SIR YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN UNPLEASANT THINGS DURING THE NIGHT
2952-408-0017 ALL OF US WERE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU BUT NOW WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO FIND YOU ALIVE AND UNHARMED GLADLY WE WOULD HAVE STAYED WITH YOU IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE BUT THE LAW OF OUR VILLAGE AS I TOLD YOU LAST EVENING OBLIGES US TO QUIT OUR HOUSES AFTER A DEATH HAS TAKEN PLACE
2952-408-0018 AND TO LEAVE THE CORPSE ALONE WHENEVER THIS LAW HAS BEEN BROKEN HERETOFORE SOME GREAT MISFORTUNE HAS FOLLOWED WHENEVER IT IS OBEYED WE FIND THAT THE CORPSE AND THE OFFERINGS DISAPPEAR DURING OUR ABSENCE PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN THE CAUSE
2952-408-0019 THEN MUSO TOLD OF THE DIM AND AWFUL SHAPE THAT HAD ENTERED THE DEATH CHAMBER TO DEVOUR THE BODY AND THE OFFERINGS NO PERSON SEEMED TO BE SURPRISED BY HIS NARRATION AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE OBSERVED
2952-408-0020 WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US REVEREND SIR AGREES WITH WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS MATTER FROM ANCIENT TIME MUSO THEN INQUIRED DOES NOT THE PRIEST ON THE HILL SOMETIMES PERFORM THE FUNERAL SERVICE FOR YOUR DEAD WHAT PRIEST THE YOUNG MAN ASKED
2952-408-0021 THE PRIEST WHO YESTERDAY EVENING DIRECTED ME TO THIS VILLAGE ANSWERED MUSO I CALLED AT HIS ANJITSU ON THE HILL YONDER HE REFUSED ME LODGING BUT TOLD ME THE WAY HERE THE LISTENERS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS IN ASTONISHMENT
2952-408-0022 AND AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID REVEREND SIR THERE IS NO PRIEST AND THERE IS NO ANJITSU ON THE HILL FOR THE TIME OF MANY GENERATIONS THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY RESIDENT PRIEST IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD MUSO SAID NOTHING MORE ON THE SUBJECT
2952-408-0023 FOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS KIND HOSTS SUPPOSED HIM TO HAVE BEEN DELUDED BY SOME GOBLIN BUT AFTER HAVING BIDDEN THEM FAREWELL AND OBTAINED ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION AS TO HIS ROAD HE DETERMINED TO LOOK AGAIN FOR THE HERMITAGE ON THE HILL AND SO TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE HAD REALLY BEEN DECEIVED
2952-408-0024 AND THIS TIME ITS AGED OCCUPANT INVITED HIM TO ENTER WHEN HE HAD DONE SO THE HERMIT HUMBLY BOWED DOWN BEFORE HIM EXCLAIMING AH I AM ASHAMED I AM VERY MUCH ASHAMED I AM EXCEEDINGLY ASHAMED
2952-408-0025 YOU NEED NOT BE ASHAMED FOR HAVING REFUSED ME SHELTER SAID MUSO YOU DIRECTED ME TO THE VILLAGE YONDER WHERE I WAS VERY KINDLY TREATED AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT FAVOR I CAN GIVE NO MAN SHELTER THE RECLUSE MADE ANSWER
2952-408-0026 SO IN THAT TIME THE BODIES OF THE MOUNTAIN FOLK WHO DIED USED TO BE BROUGHT HERE SOMETIMES FROM GREAT DISTANCES IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT REPEAT OVER THEM THE HOLY SERVICE BUT I REPEATED THE SERVICE AND PERFORMED THE RITES ONLY AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS
2952-408-0027 I THOUGHT ONLY OF THE FOOD AND THE CLOTHES THAT MY SACRED PROFESSION ENABLED ME TO GAIN AND BECAUSE OF THIS SELFISH IMPIETY I WAS REBORN IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY DEATH INTO THE STATE OF A JIKININKI
2952-408-0028 SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO FEED UPON THE CORPSES OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIE IN THIS DISTRICT EVERY ONE OF THEM I MUST DEVOUR IN THE WAY THAT YOU SAW LAST NIGHT NOW REVEREND SIR
2952-408-0029 HELP ME BY YOUR PRAYERS I ENTREAT YOU SO THAT I MAY BE SOON ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS HORRIBLE STATE OF EXISTENCE NO SOONER HAD THE HERMIT UTTERED THIS PETITION THAN HE DISAPPEARED AND THE HERMITAGE ALSO DISAPPEARED AT THE SAME INSTANT
4441-76262-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A SOUL OVERBOARD
4441-76262-0001 SOMEBODY HAD CALLED HIS NAME HE SAT UP IN BED AND LISTENED THERE WAS NOT A SOUND HE DREW UP THE BLIND AND LOOKED OUT ON A GREY AUTUMN MORNING WINDY AND RAINY HE WENT BACK TO BED AND TRIED TO SLEEP BUT IN VAIN
4441-76262-0002 THERE WERE STRANGE VOICES IN THE WIND THEY MOANED AND WARNED AND WEPT AND WHIMPERED HE TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING PLEASANT OF HIS HAPPINESS HE TOOK HIS PART AND BEGAN TO LEARN IT IT SEEMED TO BE NOTHING BUT YES MY PRINCE
4441-76262-0003 HE TRIED TO PICTURE HIMSELF ON THE STAGE AS HORATIO HE TRIED TO PICTURE AGNES IN THE PART OF OPHELIA
4441-76262-0004 SPREADING NETS FOR HAMLET AT POLONIUS'S ADVICE HE ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE AWAY THE THOUGHT AND INSTEAD OF AGNES HE SAW THE COQUETTISH MISS JACQUETTE WHO HAD BEEN THE LAST TO PLAY THE PART AT THE MUNICIPAL THEATRE
4441-76262-0005 HE TRIED IN VAIN TO DRIVE AWAY THESE DISAGREEABLE FANCIES THEY FOLLOWED HIM LIKE GNATS AT LAST EXHAUSTED WITH THE STRAIN HE FELL ASLEEP BUT ONLY TO SUFFER THE SAME TORMENT IN HIS DREAM HE ROUSED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT BUT SOON DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP AGAIN
4441-76262-0006 HE DRESSED HASTILY AND AS HE PICKED UP HIS BOOT A BIG SPIDER RAN ACROSS THE FLOOR THE SIGHT PLEASED HIM FOR HE BELIEVED IN THE SUPERSTITION THAT A SPIDER IS A HARBINGER OF HAPPINESS
4441-76262-0007 HE COULD NOT TELL WHY BUT HE THOUGHT OF THE SPIDER AND CALMLY OPENED THE DOOR A SERVANT HANDED HIM A LETTER FROM FALANDER BEGGING HIM TO COME TO HIS ROOMS AT TEN ON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS AGAIN HE WAS ASSAILED BY THE INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF FEAR
4441-76262-0008 WHICH HAD TROUBLED HIS MORNING SLUMBER HE TRIED TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME UNTIL TEN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE DRESSED AND WENT TO FALANDER'S HOUSE THE LATTER HAD RISEN EARLY HIS ROOM HAD BEEN PUT STRAIGHT AND HE WAS READY TO RECEIVE HIS FRIEND
4441-76262-0009 HE GREETED REHNHJELM CORDIALLY BUT WITH UNUSUAL GRAVITY REHNHJELM OVERWHELMED HIM WITH QUESTIONS BUT FALANDER REFUSED TO REPLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK REHNHJELM'S ANXIETY GREW AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER THERE WAS UNPLEASANT NEWS
4441-76262-0010 AND HE DECLARED THAT MANY SO CALLED UNBEARABLE SITUATIONS COULD BE BORNE QUITE EASILY IF ONLY ONE DID NOT EXAGGERATE THEIR IMPORTANCE THE TIME PASSED SLOWLY BUT AT LAST IT STRUCK TEN A GENTLE DOUBLE RAP AT THE DOOR RELIEVED THE TENSION
4441-76262-0011 FALANDER OPENED AT ONCE AND ADMITTED AGNES WITHOUT A LOOK AT THOSE PRESENT SHE DREW THE KEY FROM THE LOCK AND LOCKED THE DOOR FROM THE INSIDE A MOMENTARY EMBARRASSMENT SEIZED HER WHEN ON TURNING ROUND SHE WAS CONFRONTED BY TWO MEN INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE
4441-76262-0012 BUT HER EMBARRASSMENT GAVE WAY TO PLEASANT SURPRISE WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED REHNHJELM THROWING OFF HER WATER PROOF SHE RAN TOWARDS HIM

4441-76262-0015 FALANDER MADE NO REPLY AGNES LOOKED AT HIM MORE KEENLY
4441-76262-0016 A FLEETING EXPRESSION OF TROUBLE PASSED ACROSS HER FACE AS THE SURFACE OF A POND IS RIPPLED BY THE BREEZE BUT SHE IMMEDIATELY REGAINED HER USUAL SERENITY GLANCED AT REHNHJELM REALIZED THE SITUATION AND WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING

4441-76263-0001 AND MOREOVER THERE WERE SO MANY YOUNGER MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION IN GREATER NEED OF IT BUT HE WAS MADE TO REALIZE THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE SUN EXTINGUISHED BUT THAT THE SMALLER PLANETS TOO SUFFERED FROM TOTAL ECLIPSE HE HAD WORKED STRENUOUSLY DURING THE SUMMER
4441-76263-0002 THE PROFESSOR OF LANDSCAPE PAINTING HAD TOLD HIM AS A FRIEND THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE A GREAT ARTIST AND THE ACADEMICIAN HAD SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REHABILITATE HIMSELF AND CLUNG TO HIS FIRST OPINION IN ADDITION TO THIS THE PUBLIC TASTE IN PICTURES HAD CHANGED

4481-17499-0010 JOHN MERRICK WAS SIXTY YEARS OLD BUT AS HALE AND RUGGED AS A BOY OF TWENTY HE HAD MADE HIS VAST FORTUNE ON THE PACIFIC COAST
4481-17499-0011 WHO NEVER HAD CREDITED HIM WITH SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO EARN MORE THAN A PRECARIOUS LIVELIHOOD BUT THE MAN WAS SHREWD ENOUGH IN A BUSINESS WAY ALTHOUGH SIMPLE ALMOST TO CHILDISHNESS IN MANY OTHER MATTERS WHEN HE RETURNED QUITE UNHERALDED TO END HIS DAYS AT HOME
4481-17499-0012 AND EMPLOY HIS AMPLE WEALTH TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE FOR A TIME KEPT HIS SUCCESS A SECRET AND SO LEARNED MUCH OF THE DISPOSITIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS THREE NIECES THEY WERE AT THAT TIME VISITING HIS UNMARRIED SISTER JANE AT HER ESTATE AT ELMHURST
4481-17499-0013 AND IN THE RACE FOR AUNT JANE'S FORTUNE HE WATCHED THE THREE GIRLS CAREFULLY AND FOUND MUCH TO ADMIRE IN EACH ONE OF THEM PATSY DOYLE HOWEVER PROVED EXCEPTIONALLY FRANK AND GENUINE
4481-17499-0014 PATSY PROVED THE ONE BRIGHT STAR IN THE FIRMAMENT OF DISAPPOINTMENT SUPPOSING UNCLE JOHN TO BE POOR SHE INSISTED UPON CARRYING HIM TO NEW YORK WITH HER AND SHARING WITH HIM THE HUMBLE TENEMENT ROOM IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH HER FATHER A RETIRED VETERAN WHO HELPED PAY THE FAMILY EXPENSES
4481-17499-0015 BY KEEPING BOOKS FOR A MERCANTILE FIRM WHILE PATSY WORKED IN A HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP IT WAS NOW THAT UNCLE JOHN PROVED A MODERN FAIRY GODFATHER TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES WHO WERE LIKEWISE HIS OWN NIECES THE THREE GIRLS HAD LITTLE IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIR POVERTY
4481-17499-0016 ELIZABETH DE GRAF BEING THE DAUGHTER OF A MUSIC TEACHER IN CLOVERTON OHIO WHILE LOUISE MERRICK LIVED WITH HER WIDOWED MOTHER IN A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE SECOND CLASS IN NEW YORK
4481-17499-0017 WHERE THE TWO WOMEN FRANKLY INTRIGUED TO ENSNARE FOR LOUISE A HUSBAND WHO HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS TO ENSURE BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER A COMFORTABLE HOME IN SPITE OF THIS WORLDLY AND UNLOVELY AMBITION WHICH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT PARTIALLY EXCUSE LOUISE
4481-17499-0018 WHO WAS BUT SEVENTEEN HAD MANY GOOD AND WOMANLY QUALITIES COULD THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN ATMOSPHERE UNINFLUENCED BY THE SCHEMES OF HER VAIN AND SELFISH MOTHER UNCLE JOHN CASTING ASIDE THE MASK OF POVERTY CAME TO THE RELIEF OF ALL THREE GIRLS
4481-17499-0019 HE SETTLED THE INCOMES OF SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY UPON BOTH BETH AND LOUISE MAKING THEM PRACTICALLY INDEPENDENT FOR PATSY HE BOUGHT A HANDSOME MODERN FLAT BUILDING LOCATED AT THIRTY SEVEN O EIGHT WILLING SQUARE
4481-17499-0020 AND INSTALLED HER AND THE MAJOR IN ITS COSIEST APARTMENT THE RENTS OF THE REMAINING FLATS GIVING THE DOYLES AN ADEQUATE INCOME FOR ALL TIME TO COME HERE UNCLE JOHN BELIEVING HIMSELF CORDIALLY WELCOME AS INDEED HE WAS MADE HIS OWN HOME
4481-17499-0021 AND IT REQUIRED NO SHREWD GUESSING TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT LITTLE PATSY WAS DESTINED TO INHERIT SOME DAY ALL HIS MILLIONS
4481-17499-0022 HAD LONG MANAGED SUCCESSFULLY JOHN MERRICK'S VAST FORTUNE AND AT HIS SOLICITATION IT GAVE MAJOR DOYLE A RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN ITS MAIN OFFICE WITH A SALARY THAT RENDERED HIM INDEPENDENT OF HIS DAUGHTER'S SUDDENLY ACQUIRED WEALTH AND MADE HIM PROUD AND SELF RESPECTING
4481-17499-0023 MONEY HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DOYLES THE MAJOR REMAINED THE SAME SIMPLE HONEST COURTEOUS YET BRUSQUE OLD WARRIOR WHO HAD WON UNCLE JOHN'S LOVE AS A HARD WORKING BOOK KEEPER
4481-17499-0024 AND PATSY'S BRIGHT AND SUNNY DISPOSITION HAD CERTAIN POWER TO CHEER ANY HOME WHETHER LOCATED IN A PALACE OR A HOVEL NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD UNCLE JOHN BEEN SO SUPREMELY HAPPY
4481-17499-0025 AND NEVER BEFORE HAD AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES HAD SO MANY ADVANTAGES AND PLEASURES IT WAS TO CONFER STILL FURTHER BENEFITS UPON THESE GIRLS THAT THEIR ECCENTRIC UNCLE HAD PLANNED THIS UNEXPECTED EUROPEAN TRIP HIS TELEGRAM TO ELIZABETH WAS CHARACTERISTIC
4481-17499-0026 PATSY LOUISE AND I SAIL FOR EUROPE NEXT TUESDAY WILL YOU JOIN US AS MY GUEST IF SO TAKE FIRST TRAIN TO NEW YORK WHERE I WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR OUTFIT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY THAT WAS A MESSAGE LIKELY TO SURPRISE A COUNTRY GIRL
4481-17499-0027 BUT IT DID NOT STRIKE JOHN MERRICK AS IN ANY WAY EXTRAORDINARY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DEPEND UPON BETH SHE WOULD BE AS EAGER TO GO AS HE WAS TO HAVE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PAID FOR THE TELEGRAM HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM FURTHER THOUGHT NEXT MORNING
4481-17499-0028 PATSY REMINDED HIM THAT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN TOWN HE MUST PERSONALLY NOTIFY LOUISE MERRICK OF THE PROPOSED TRIP SO HE TOOK A CROSS TOWN LINE AND ARRIVED AT THE MERRICK'S HOME AT NINE O'CLOCK MISSUS MERRICK WAS IN A MORNING WRAPPER
4481-17499-0029 SIPPING HER COFFEE IN AN UPPER ROOM BUT SHE COULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO UNCLE JOHN HER DEAD HUSBAND'S BROTHER AND HER ONLY DAUGHTER'S BENEFACTOR WHICH MEANT INDIRECTLY HER OWN BENEFACTOR SO SHE ORDERED THE MAID TO SHOW HIM UP AT ONCE
4481-17499-0030 LOUISE IS STILL SWEETLY SLEEPING SHE SAID AND WON'T WAKEN FOR HOURS YET IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH DEAR NO BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT GET UP WITH THE MILKMAN AS YOU DO JOHN
4481-17499-0031 AND THE DEAR CHILD WAS AT THE OPERA LAST NIGHT WHICH MADE HER LATE IN GETTING HOME DOESN'T THE OPERA LET OUT BEFORE MIDNIGHT THE SAME AS THE THEATRES HE ASKED I BELIEVE SO BUT THERE IS THE SUPPER AFTERWARD YOU KNOW
4481-17499-0032 AH YES HE RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY I'VE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT THE OPERA MAKES FOLKS DESPERATELY HUNGRY FOR THEY FLOCK TO THE RESTAURANTS AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET AWAY SINGULAR ISN'T IT WHY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT IN THAT LIGHT
4481-17499-0033 BUT LOUISE IS WELL QUITE WELL THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT RELIEF FOR I'M GOING TO TAKE HER TO EUROPE WITH ME NEXT WEEK HE SAID MISSUS MERRICK WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE NEARLY DROPPED HER COFFEE CUP
4481-17499-0034 AND COULD MAKE NO BETTER REPLY THAN TO STARE BLANKLY AT HER BROTHER IN LAW WE SAIL TUESDAY CONTINUED UNCLE JOHN AND YOU MUST HAVE MY NIECE READY IN TIME AND DELIVER HER ON BOARD THE PRINCESS IRENE AT HOBOKEN AT NINE O'CLOCK SHARP
4481-17499-0035 IT WILL TAKE A MONTH AT LEAST TO MAKE HER GOWNS AND STUFF AND RUBBISH HE GROWLED THAT SHOWS MARTHA HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT EUROPEAN TRIPS NO ONE MAKES GOWNS TO GO ABROAD WITH YOU BUY EM IN PARIS TO BRING HOME
4481-17499-0036 AH YES TO BE SURE SHE MUTTERED PERHAPS THEN IT CAN BE DONE IF LOUISE HAS NO OTHER ENGAGEMENTS JUST WHAT PATSY SAID SEE HERE MARTHA DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ANY GIRL WHO IS HALF HUMAN COULD HAVE ENGAGEMENTS THAT WOULD KEEP HER FROM EUROPE
4481-17499-0037 BUT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY YOU'LL GET ME RILED PRETTY SOON MARTHA AND IF YOU DO YOU'LL WISH YOU HADN'T THIS SPEECH FRIGHTENED THE WOMAN IT WOULDN'T DO TO PROVOKE UNCLE JOHN HOWEVER UNREASONABLE HE HAPPENED TO BE SO SHE SAID MEEKLY
4481-17499-0038 I'VE NO DOUBT LOUISE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO GO AND SO WILL I YOU WHY WHY WHOM DO YOU INTEND TAKING JUST THE THREE GIRLS AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES ALSO MINE BUT YOU'LL WANT A CHAPERONE FOR THEM
4481-17499-0039 WHY SO PROPRIETY REQUIRES IT AND SO DOES ORDINARY PRUDENCE LOUISE I KNOW WILL BE DISCREET FOR IT IS HER NATURE BUT PATSY IS SUCH A LITTLE FLYAWAY
4481-17499-0040 UNCLE JOHN GREW RED AND HIS EYES FLASHED A CHAPERONE HE CRIED CONTEMPTUOUSLY NOT ANY IN MINE MARTHA MERRICK EITHER WE YOUNG FOLKS GO ALONE WITHOUT ANY DEATH'S HEAD TO PERPETUALLY GLOWER AT US
4481-17499-0041 THREE BETTER GIRLS NEVER LIVED AND I'LL TRUST EM ANYWHERE BESIDES THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO ANY OF YOUR CONFOUNDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING ON A REG'LAR PICNIC AND IF I DON'T GIVE THOSE GIRLS THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES MY NAME AIN'T JOHN MERRICK
4481-17499-0042 A CHAPERONE INDEED MISSUS MERRICK HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR I'M NOT SURE JOHN SHE GASPED THAT I OUGHT TO TRUST MY DEAR CHILD WITH AN UNCLE WHO DISREGARDS SO OPENLY THE PROPRIETIES
4481-17499-0043 WELL I'M SURE AND THE THING'S SETTLED HE SAID MORE CALMLY DON'T WORRY MA'AM I'LL LOOK AFTER PATSY AND BETH AND LOUISE WILL LOOK AFTER ALL OF US JUST AS SHE DOES AFTER YOU BECAUSE SHE'S SO DISCREET TALK ABOUT YOUR BEING A CHAPERONE
4481-17499-0044 WHY YOU DON'T DARE SAY YOUR SOUL'S YOUR OWN WHEN LOUISE IS AWAKE THAT CHAPERONE BUSINESS IS ALL HUMBUGGERY UNLESS AN OLD UNCLE LIKE ME CAN BE A CHAPERONE ANYHOW I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE APPOINTED I WON'T WAIT FOR LOUISE TO WAKE UP
4481-17499-0045 JUST TELL HER THE NEWS AND HELP HER TO GET READY ON TIME AND NOW I'M OFF GOOD MORNING MARTHA SHE REALLY HAD NO WORDS OF PROTEST READY AT HAND AND IT WAS LONG AFTER QUEER OLD JOHN MERRICK HAD GONE AWAY THAT SHE REMEMBERED A DOZEN EFFECTIVE SPEECHES THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED
4481-17499-0046 AFTER ALL SHE SIGHED TAKING UP HER CUP AGAIN IT MAY BE THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR LOUISE WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT YOUNG WELDON WHO IS PAYING HER ATTENTIONS JUST NOW IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS FATHER'S MONEY OR NOT HE'S BEEN A BIT WILD I'VE HEARD
4481-17499-0047 AND IT IS JUST AS WELL TO POSTPONE ANY ENGAGEMENT UNTIL WE FIND OUT THE FACTS I CAN DO THAT NICELY WHILE MY SWEET CHILD IS IN EUROPE WITH UNCLE JOHN AND AWAY FROM ALL DANGER OF ENTANGLEMENTS
7800-283493-0000 THE BIG MOOSE A BULL MOOSE YOU SAY WILL ECHOED BLUFF HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH SUDDEN ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN REPLIED THE OTHER I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BLUFF AND THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW A BULL MOOSE IF I SAW ONE

7800-283493-0004 THEN I KNEW IT MUST BE A BULL MOOSE AND THE NEXT THING I FOUND MYSELF TAKING HIS PICTURE DID HE RUN AWAY THEN ASKED FRANK TURNED AND TROTTED OFF AS IF HE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT WILL CONTINUED I EVEN HAD THE NERVE TO SHOOT HIM AGAIN AS HE WAS GOING

7800-283493-0008 HE DID NOT FEEL THAT THEY COULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE EVIDENCE OF WILL WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SO STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN COMING OF SOME ANIMAL THAT HIS IMAGINATION WORKED OVERTIME I HOPE IT WASN'T JUST A MULE THAT STRAYED AWAY FROM SOME LUMBER CAMP HE TOLD THE OTHERS
7800-283493-0009 AS THEY HURRIED OFF BUT NOT BEFORE BLUFF AND JERRY HAD DARTED INSIDE THE CABIN AND REAPPEARED CARRYING THEIR GUNS

7800-283492-0001 WELL IF YOU ASKED ME MY OPINION I'D HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF A FEW OF THOSE LUMBERJACKS BUT NOBODY HAS ACCUSED ANY OF THE LOGGERS OF THE CRIME REMARKED FRANK AND AT THAT THE HEAD PROJECTING FROM THE OPENING AT THE DOOR CAME A LITTLE FURTHER INTO VIEW
7800-283492-0002 WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE FRANK THOUGHT THAT THE WOUNDED BOY MUST TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE DISCUSSION WHY WHO ELSE WOULD TRY TO TURN ON MISTER DARREL THAT WAY AND BURN HIS SHANTIES DOWN JUST WHEN WINTER IS SETTING IN ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0003 WE CAN ONLY GIVE A GUESS AT THAT FRANK TOLD HIM WHEW EXCLAIMED BLUFF AS HE GRASPED THE MEANING BACK OF THOSE FEW WORDS AFTER ALL I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM FRANK
7800-283492-0004 AND NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THESE STRANGE HINTS PORTENDED WE HAD A SPECIMEN OF HIS NASTY TEMPER YOU KNOW CONTINUED BLUFF YES TWICE NOW WE'VE HEARD HIM TEAR AROUND LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
7800-283492-0005 OH NOW I TUMBLE TO WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED WILL WHO DID NOT OFTEN USE ANY SORT OF SLANG AND MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN UNUSUALLY EXCITED TO FALL INTO THE HABIT IT'S BILL BILL NACKERSON FRANK NODDED HIS HEAD

7800-283492-0007 YES AND DIDN'T WE HEAR HIM THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE LONG SO AS TO HIT BACK AT MISTER DARREL JERRY WANTED TO KNOW AS IF HE HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF THE BIG SPORTSMAN
7800-283492-0008 WHY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM WHOEVER STARTED THE FIRE DIDN'T CARE A HOOT WHETHER IT HURT OR NOT I THINK BLUFF GAVE AS HIS OPINION FRANK NOTICED THAT THE HEAD HAD DISAPPEARED FROM ALONGSIDE THE OPEN DOOR
7800-283492-0009 EVIDENTLY TEDDY HAD HEARD ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE LIMPED FROM HIS CHAIR TO THE DOORWAY UPON HEARING STRANGE VOICES OUTSIDE PERHAPS HE HAD SUSPECTED THAT THE OTHERS BROUGHT NEWS OF SOME STARTLING CHARACTER FRANK DID NOT TELL ALL OF HIS CHUMS ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN
7800-283492-0010 AT THE SAME TIME IT GAVE HIM FOOD FOR MUCH SERIOUS THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF TEDDY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FIRE BUSINESS HE MENTIONED TO BLUFF A SHORT TIME LATER WHEN THEY WALKED TOGETHER DOWN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MINK TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN
7800-283492-0011 I SAW HIS HEAD THOUGH AFTER A BIT WHEN WE HAD TALKED MATTERS OVER HE WENT BACK TO THE FIRE AGAIN
7800-283492-0012 OH NO IT ISN'T SO BAD AS THAT HE WAS ASSURED
7800-283492-0013 THE BIG COWARD MUTTERED BLUFF CLENCHING HIS FISTS AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GET IN A BLOW AT THE BULLY MY OPINION AS FAR AS I HAVE ANY IS ABOUT LIKE THIS FRANK CONTINUED
7800-283492-0014 AFTER NACKERSON STRUCK TEDDY THE BOY HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR HIM BOASTING ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT TO DO TO THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN OH I SEE NOW WHAT YOU MEAN FRANK
7800-283492-0015 YOU'VE GOT IT ABOUT STRAIGHT BLUFF FRANK ADMITTED OF COURSE I'M ONLY GUESSING ALL THIS REMEMBER
7800-283492-0016 HE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN HIS HEAD TO SHIELD A RASCAL WHO DIDN'T HESITATE TO STRIKE HIM A COWARDLY BLOW BLUFF WAS NOT SLOW OF COMPREHENSION
7800-283492-0017 JUST AS YOU SAY TEDDY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO PUT THE MATCH TO THE CAMP OVER AT LUMBER RUN WHEN NACKERSON HAD GONE AWAY PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS PALS WHO AGREED TO STAND BACK OF HIM THAT'S THE TIME TEDDY LIT OUT
7800-283492-0018 HE STRUCK IT PRETTY HARD AT FIRST GETTING CAUGHT IN THAT TRAP FRANK MUSED BUT WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO FACTS I GUESS IT WAS JUST AS WELL THAT IT HAPPENED TO HIM HUH THAT'S A QUEER THING TO SAY REMONSTRATED BLUFF
7800-283492-0019 BLUFF ADMITTED AS TEDDY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE HUNG OUT AND COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY TO LUMBER RUN CAMP YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING BACK TO NACKERSON OR LOSING HIMSELF IN THE BIG WOODS
7800-283492-0020 WHEW IT DOES TAKE YOU TO SEE THROUGH THINGS BLUFF DECLARED WITH A LAUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND NOW THAT IT WAS A BIG STREAK OF LUCK FOR TED WHEN HE MET WITH THAT BEAR TRAP WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE WELL OFF DO WE
7800-283492-0021 FRANK WAS ALWAYS ACCOMMODATING ESPECIALLY WHEN ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE WAS CONCERNED HE LOVED TO WATCH THE SMALL WOODS FOLK WHEN THEY DID NOT SUSPECT HIS PRESENCE AND LEARN MORE AND MORE OF THEIR INTERESTING HABITS
7800-283492-0022 SO THAT DAY PASSED ANOTHER AND YET A THIRD FOUND THE BOYS ENJOYING THEMSELVES TO THE LIMIT TEDDY WAS SHOWING DECIDED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT HE COULD GET AROUND FAIRLY WELL BY NOW JERRY HAVING CUT HIM A WALKING STICK WITH A CROOK AT THE END
7800-283492-0023 HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET OVER THE NERVOUSNESS THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY FOLLOWING HIS ADVENT IN THE NEW CAMP
7800-283492-0024 TO GO BACK TO THAT OTHER DRUDGERY WOULD HAVE BEEN TORTURE AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO GET AROUND HE INSISTED ON TAKING CHARGE OF THE COOKING AND THE BOYS SOON LEARNED THAT TEDDY COULD MANAGE SPLENDIDLY
7800-283492-0025 HE HAD TO BE SHOWN VERY LITTLE SO AS TO SUIT THEIR TASTES AND NONE OF THEM REGRETTED IN THE LEAST THAT THEY HAD EXTENDED A HELPING HAND TOWARD ONE IN DISTRESS A NEW LIFE WAS OPENING UP TO TEDDY
7800-283492-0026 HE HAD NEVER BEFORE COME IN CONTACT WITH SUCH AN AGREEABLE LOT OF COMPANIONS AND EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY HE TRIED TO PROVE HIMSELF GRATEFUL STILL HE DID NOT MENTION A WORD ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOW OF THE DASTARDLY DEED
7800-283492-0027 WHEN SOME ONE ATTEMPTED TO FIRE THE LOGGING CAMP FRANK OFTEN SAW A WORRIED EXPRESSION COME OVER THE BOY'S FACE AND AT SUCH TIMES HE SUSPECTED THAT TEDDY WAS PUZZLING HIS BRAIN AS TO JUST WHAT HIS DUTY MIGHT BE
7800-283492-0028 AND IF HE DOES IT WILL NOT BE THE REWARD OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL ON THE SECOND DAY ABOUT NOON SOME OF THE BOYS WERE BUSY NEAR THE CABIN LAYING IN AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF FIREWOOD
7800-283492-0029 FRANK HAD AN IDEA THEY WOULD BE VISITED BY A BIG SNOWFALL BEFORE TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY A HAZARD FELLOWS HE TOLD BLUFF AND JERRY WHO WERE HELPING HIM ADD TO THE HANDY HEAP CLOSE TO THE DOOR OF THE CABIN
7800-283492-0030 BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A FEELING OF DAMPNESS IN THE AIR FOR ALL IT'S SO COLD AND THE SUN YOU NOTICE SHINES THROUGH A SORT OF HAZY CURTAIN I THINK JUST THE SAME WAY YOU DO FRANK JERRY REMARKED AND IF YOU ASKED ME TO SAY WHEN
7800-283492-0031 I'D GUESS IT WAS GOING TO STRIKE US BEFORE NIGHT WE'VE GOT OFF PRETTY FORTUNATELY SO FAR ABOUT STORMS BLUFF WENT ON AS HE THREW ANOTHER ARMFUL OF FUEL ON THE ALREADY HUGE PILE
7800-283492-0032 AND TO THINK IT HAPPENED SO NEAR OUR CAMP THAT WE MANAGED TO TOTE THE WHOLE CARCASS TO THE CABIN AND BLUFF LOOKED WITH PRIDE IN HIS EYES TOWARD A DEER THAT WAS HANGING IN REAL SPORTSMAN STYLE FROM A LIMB HEAD DOWNWARD
7800-283492-0033 IF WE DON'T GET ANOTHER WHILE WE'RE UP HERE IN THE BIG WOODS SAID JERRY SUPPRESSING THE NATURAL TWINGE OF JEALOUSY HE FELT WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED WITH OUR BAG AND WILL IS JUST WILD OVER THE BULLY PICTURES HE'S ACCUMULATING EVERY DAY AND NIGHT
7800-283492-0034 IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD MET WITH NOTHING BUT SUCCESS SO FAR FRANK ADMITTED I HOPE HE GETS THAT PRIZE THE RAILROADS ARE OFFERING SO FAR AS I CAN TELL HE HAS A DANDY COLLECTION ALREADY AND WE'VE GOT SOME TIME AHEAD OF US STILL BY THE WAY WHERE IS WILL NOW ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0035 ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING OFF TO THE PLACE WHERE WE DISCOVERED THAT COMICAL COLONY OF SQUIRRELS THAT AMUSED US YESTERDAY FRANK EXPLAINED HE HOPED BY KEEPING AS STILL AS A MOUSE TO GET A SNAP AT THEM WHEN THEY WERE CARRYING ON THAT WAY
7800-283492-0036 I THINK MYSELF IT WOULD BE A FINE WOODS PICTURE AND ADD TO HIS COLLECTION SPEAKING OF ANGELS AND YOU'RE MOST SURE TO HEAR THEIR WINGS CHUCKLED JERRY FOR THERE'S WILL COMING THIS WAY NOW AND ON THE RUN TOO ADDED FRANK
7800-283492-0037 HE LOOKS EXCITED FELLOWS I WONDER WHAT HE'S RUN ACROSS NOW WILL WAS ALMOST OUT OF BREATH THEY COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE WAS RED FROM HIS EXERTIONS BUT FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT AS WELL WHILE HIS EYES WERE AS BLUFF EXPRESSED IT
7800-283492-0038 STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD OH WHAT A WHOPPER HE GASPED AS HE DREW NEAR THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WHAT'S THAT DEMANDED FRANK WONDERING WHAT WAS COMING NOW AND SUCH TRE MENDOUS HORNS TOO CONTINUED WILL
7800-283492-0039 INVOLUNTARILY STRETCHING OUT BOTH HANDS UNTIL HE HAD THEM WIDE APART HORNS WILL BLUFF FIRED AT HIM COWS HAVE HORNS DEER CARRY ANTLERS I SAID HORNS DIDN'T I ASSERTED THE OTHER WITH DETERMINATION
7800-283492-0040 BUT I SNAPPED HIM BEFORE HE TURNED AND TROTTED OFF WHAT TROTTED OFF SHRILLED BLUFF
5463-39174-0000 AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER WE LEFT LUCY ROBARTS WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS CRAWLEY WHO WAS SITTING WITH ONE BABY IN HER LAP WHILE SHE WAS ROCKING ANOTHER WHO LAY IN A CRADLE AT HER FEET MISTER CRAWLEY IN THE MEANWHILE HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT WITH HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF AN OLD GRAMMAR
5463-39174-0001 FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
5463-39174-0002 THE REALITIES OF LIFE HAD BECOME SO STERN TO HER THAT THE OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THEM WERE AS NOTHING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED A NEW GOWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER IF ALL THE COUNTY KNEW THAT THE ONE IN WHICH SHE WENT TO CHURCH HAD BEEN TURNED THREE TIMES
5463-39174-0003 IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
5463-39174-0004 MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
5463-39174-0005 AND ARE YOU A GREAT SCHOLAR ASKED LUCY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER I DON'T KNOW SAID GRACE WITH A SHEEPISH FACE I AM IN GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY PUT UP HER HANDS WITH ASTONISHMENT
5463-39174-0006 AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
5463-39174-0007 A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP IS THE ONLY FORTUNE THAT HAS COME IN MY WAY AND I ENDEAVOUR TO SHARE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I BELIEVE MEN SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST FORTUNE ANY OF US CAN HAVE SAID LUCY THINKING HOWEVER IN HER OWN MIND
5463-39174-0008 THAT HORACE AND THE IRREGULAR GREEK VERBS SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF PRECOCIOUS FORCING IN A YOUNG LADY OF NINE YEARS OLD BUT NEVERTHELESS GRACE WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE LOOKING GIRL AND CLUNG TO HER ALLY CLOSELY AND SEEMED TO LIKE BEING FONDLED
5463-39174-0009 SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
5463-39174-0010 YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
5463-39174-0011 THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
5463-39174-0012 LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ANXIOUS DISCUSSION IN WHICH SHE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY ON NURSERY MATTERS PRAY TELL HIM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM
5463-39174-0013 HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
5463-39174-0014 AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
5463-39174-0015 WHAT IS THAT BOB SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GINGERBREAD FALTERED BOBBY FEELING THAT A SIN HAD BEEN COMMITTED THOUGH PROBABLY FEELING ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY AS YET BE ACCOUNTED AS DEEPLY GUILTY MISS ROBARTS SAID THE FATHER WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
5463-39174-0016 BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE HARDLY USED TO SUCH THINGS
5463-39174-0017 OH CERTAINLY BOB MY CHILD
5463-39174-0018 AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
5463-39174-0019 THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
5463-39174-0020 AND THERE WAS JELLY FOR THE SICK CHILD AND CHICKEN BROTH WHICH WAS INDEED ANOTHER JELLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH OPENLY THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT OF FRESH PORK AND A BASKET OF EGGS FROM THE FRAMLEY PARSONAGE FARMYARD WHICH MISSUS ROBARTS WAS TO INTRODUCE SHOULD SHE FIND HERSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SO
5463-39174-0021 BUT WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE CAST OUT WITH UTTER SCORN BY MISTER CRAWLEY IF TENDERED IN HIS IMMEDIATE PRESENCE THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A SUGGESTION AS TO ADDING TWO OR THREE BOTTLES OF PORT BUT THE COURAGE OF THE LADIES HAD FAILED THEM ON THAT HEAD AND THE WINE WAS NOT NOW ADDED TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES
5463-39174-0022 LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
5463-39174-0023 BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
5463-39174-0024 MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0025 IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
5463-39174-0026 WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
5463-39174-0027 MISS ROBARTS I AM AFRAID YOU MUST EXCUSE ME SAID HE GETTING UP AND TAKING HIS HAT AND STICK LUCY BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE AT ALL IN THE WAY AND ALREADY BEGAN TO SPECULATE HOW SHE MIGHT BEST UNLOAD HER TREASURES
5463-39174-0028 AND THEN STICK IN HAND HE WALKED FORTH AND LUCY FANCIED THAT BOBBY'S EYES IMMEDIATELY RESTED ON THE BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS BOB SAID SHE ALMOST IN A WHISPER
5463-39174-0029 I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
5463-39174-0030 HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF SUGAR PLUMS IN SPITE OF THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY WITHDREW HER HAND FROM HER MUFF AND LOOKED GUILTY WAS SHE NOT DECEIVING THE GOOD MAN NAY TEACHING HIS OWN CHILDREN TO DECEIVE HIM
5463-39174-0031 BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
5463-39174-0032 SOME ONE ELSE ALSO HAD LEARNED THAT PAPA WAS GONE FOR WHILE BOB AND GRACE WERE STILL COUNTING THE BIG LUMPS OF SUGAR CANDY EACH EMPLOYED THE WHILE FOR INWARD SOLACE WITH AN INCH OF BARLEY SUGAR THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A BIG BASKET AND A BUNDLE DONE UP IN A KITCHEN CLOTH
5463-39174-0033 I DID VENTURE TO BRING THEM SAID FANNY WITH A LOOK OF SHAME FOR I KNOW HOW A SICK CHILD OCCUPIES THE WHOLE HOUSE AH MY FRIEND SAID MISSUS CRAWLEY TAKING HOLD OF MISSUS ROBARTS ARM AND LOOKING INTO HER FACE THAT SORT OF SHAME IS OVER WITH ME
5463-39174-0034 GOD HAS TRIED US WITH WANT AND FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE I AM GLAD OF SUCH RELIEF BUT WILL HE BE ANGRY I WILL MANAGE IT DEAR MISSUS ROBARTS YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT HIM HIS LOT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO BEAR
5463-39174-0035 SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
5463-39174-0036 TO FEEL HERSELF SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER CLERGYMEN AROUND HER TO KNOW THAT THEY LIVED SOFTLY WHILE SHE WITH ALL THE WORK OF HER HANDS AND UNCEASING STRUGGLE OF HER ENERGIES COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO PLACE WHOLESOME FOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING A GRIEVOUS THING TO THINK OF
5463-39174-0037 THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
5463-39174-0038 MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0039 OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
5463-39174-0040 THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
5463-39174-0041 BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
5463-39174-0042 BUT SUCH A FRIEND MUST BE EQUAL NOT ONLY IN MIND BUT IN PURSE AND WHERE CAN HE EVER FIND SUCH A MAN AS THAT BUT YOU MAY GET BETTER PREFERMENT AH NO AND IF HE DID WE ARE HARDLY FIT FOR IT NOW IF I COULD THINK THAT I COULD EDUCATE MY CHILDREN
5463-39174-0043 IF I COULD ONLY DO SOMETHING FOR MY POOR GRACE IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID A WORD OR TWO BUT NOT MUCH SHE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE COULD GET HER HUSBAND'S LEAVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR GRACE
5463-39174-0044 AND WAS IT NOT INCUMBENT ON HER TO MAKE SOME KINDLY USE OF ALL THE GOODS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED HERSELF AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM EACH AGAIN WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN HER ARMS
5463-39174-0045 LUCY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHILE WITH THE CHILDREN AND WHEN THE TWO MARRIED LADIES ENTERED THEY FOUND THAT A SHOP HAD BEEN OPENED AT WHICH ALL MANNER OF LUXURIES WERE BEING READILY SOLD AND PURCHASED AT MARVELLOUSLY EASY PRICES THE GUAVA JELLY WAS THERE AND THE ORANGES AND THE SUGAR PLUMS RED AND YELLOW AND STRIPED
5463-39174-0046 AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
5463-39174-0047 AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
5463-39174-0048 FANNY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK HOW VERY DIFFERENT THOSE TWO ARE SHE SAID DIFFERENT IN THEIR MINDS AND IN THEIR SPIRIT BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER TONED IS HER MIND THAN HIS HOW WEAK HE IS IN MANY THINGS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS IN EVERYTHING
5463-39174-0049 HOW FALSE IS HIS PRIDE AND HOW FALSE HIS SHAME BUT WE MUST REMEMBER WHAT HE HAS TO BEAR IT IS NOT EVERY ONE THAT CAN ENDURE SUCH A LIFE AS HIS WITHOUT FALSE PRIDE AND FALSE SHAME BUT SHE HAS NEITHER SAID LUCY
5463-39174-0050 BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT
5688-41232-0000 APPENDIX A THE INFLUENCE OF MENSTRUATION ON THE POSITION OF WOMEN A QUESTION OF HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY
5688-41232-0001 IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE HERE STRIKE ON A FACTOR OF SUCH IMPORTANCE SUCH NEGLECTED IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEXUAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN THAT IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED
5688-41232-0002 AMONG THE NEGROES OF SURINAM A WOMAN MUST LIVE IN SOLITUDE DURING THE TIME OF HER PERIOD IT IS DANGEROUS FOR ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO APPROACH HER AND WHEN SHE SEES A PERSON COMING NEAR SHE CRIES OUT ANXIOUSLY
5688-41232-0003 I AM UNCLEAN I AM UNCLEAN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE FIND TRACES OF THE CUSTOM OF WHICH THIS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE BUT WE MUST NOT TOO HASTILY ASSUME THAT THIS CUSTOM IS EVIDENCE OF THE INFERIOR POSITION OCCUPIED BY SEMI CIVILIZED WOMEN
5688-41232-0004 IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A BROAD VIEW NOT ONLY OF THE BELIEFS OF SEMI CIVILIZED MAN REGARDING MENSTRUATION
5688-41232-0005 HAVE BEEN CREDITED WITH SOME DESIGN SINISTER OR EROTIC ON WOMEN
5688-41232-0006 ALL THESE FIGURES ARE REPRODUCED BY PLOSS AND BARTELS EVEN IN MODERN EUROPE THE SAME IDEAS PREVAIL IN PORTUGAL ACCORDING TO REYS IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING MENSTRUATION WOMEN ARE LIABLE TO BE BITTEN BY LIZARDS
5688-41232-0007 AND TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RISK THEY WEAR DRAWERS DURING THE PERIOD IN GERMANY AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED UP TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT LEAST
5688-41232-0008 TO BUILD UP THIS WORLD WIDE BELIEF REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION THIS PRIMITIVE THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF MENSTRUATION PROBABLY BRINGS BEFORE US IN ITS EARLIEST SHAPE THE SPECIAL AND INTIMATE BOND WHICH HAS EVER BEEN HELD TO CONNECT WOMEN
5688-41232-0009 BY VIRTUE OF THE MENSTRUAL PROCESS WITH THE NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL POWERS OF THE WORLD EVERYWHERE MENSTRUATING WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED BY SPIRITS AND CHARGED WITH MYSTERIOUS FORCES IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT A SERIOUS MISCONCEPTION
5688-41232-0010 AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER THE SAVAGE RARELY DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN BAD AND GOOD SPIRITS EVERY SPIRIT MAY HAVE EITHER A BENEFICIAL OR MALIGNANT INFLUENCE
5688-41232-0011 THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL SENSE IN WHICH THE WORD UNCLEAN IS USED IN THIS CONNECTION WAS CLEARLY POINTED OUT BY ROBERTSON SMITH IN THE CASE OF THE SEMITES
5688-41232-0012 IS NOT THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THINGS PHYSICALLY FOUL IT IS A RITUAL TERM AND CORRESPONDS EXACTLY TO THE IDEA OF TABOO THE IDEAS UNCLEAN AND HOLY SEEM TO US TO STAND IN POLAR OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER
5688-41232-0013 BUT IT WAS NOT SO WITH THE SEMITES AMONG THE LATER JEWS THE HOLY BOOKS DEFILED THE HANDS OF THE READER AS CONTACT WITH AN IMPURE THING DID AMONG LUCIAN'S SYRIANS
5688-41232-0014 WELLHAUSEN HOWEVER DEALING WITH THE EARLY ARABIANS EXPRESSLY MENTIONS THAT IN PRE ISLAMIC DAYS CLEAN AND UNCLEAN WERE USED SOLELY WITH REFERENCE TO WOMEN IN AND OUT OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0015 AT A LATER DATE FRAZER DEVELOPED THIS ASPECT OF THE CONCEPTION OF TABOO AND SHOWED HOW IT OCCURS AMONG SAVAGE RACES GENERALLY HE POINTED OUT THAT THE CONCEPTIONS OF HOLINESS AND POLLUTION NOT HAVING YET BEEN DIFFERENTIATED
5688-41232-0016 WOMEN AT CHILDBIRTH AND DURING MENSTRUATION ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DIVINE KINGS CHIEFS AND PRIESTS AND MUST OBSERVE THE SAME RULES OF CEREMONIAL PURITY TO SECLUDE SUCH PERSONS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD SO THAT THE DREADED SPIRITUAL DANGER SHALL NOT SPREAD
5688-41232-0017 IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOO WHICH FRAZER COMPARES TO AN ELECTRICAL INSULATOR TO PRESERVE THE SPIRITUAL FORCE WITH WHICH THESE PERSONS ARE CHARGED FROM SUFFERING OR INFLICTING HARM BY CONTACT WITH THE OUTER WORLD
5688-41232-0018 AFTER DESCRIBING THE PHENOMENA ESPECIALLY THE PROHIBITION TO TOUCH THE GROUND OR SEE THE SUN FOUND AMONG VARIOUS RACES FRAZER CONCLUDES
5688-41232-0019 THE OBJECT OF SECLUDING WOMEN AT MENSTRUATION IS TO NEUTRALIZE THE DANGEROUS INFLUENCES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO EMANATE FROM THEM AT SUCH TIMES THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THESE RULES IS TO KEEP THE GIRL SUSPENDED SO TO SAY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
5688-41232-0020 WHETHER ENVELOPED IN HER HAMMOCK AND SLUNG UP TO THE ROOF AS IN SOUTH AMERICA OR ELEVATED ABOVE THE GROUND IN A DARK AND NARROW CAGE AS IN NEW ZEALAND SHE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF DOING MISCHIEF SINCE BEING SHUT OFF BOTH FROM THE EARTH AND FROM THE SUN
5688-41232-0021 THE PRECAUTIONS THUS TAKEN TO ISOLATE OR INSULATE THE GIRL ARE DICTATED BY REGARD FOR HER OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IN SHORT THE GIRL IS VIEWED AS CHARGED WITH A POWERFUL FORCE WHICH IF NOT KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS
5688-41232-0022 MAY PROVE THE DESTRUCTION BOTH OF THE GIRL HERSELF AND OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT TO REPRESS THIS FORCE WITHIN THE LIMITS NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CONCERNED IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOOS IN QUESTION
5688-41232-0023 THE SAME EXPLANATION APPLIES TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SAME RULES BY DIVINE KINGS AND PRIESTS
5688-41232-0024 AND ARGUING THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM THE CUSTOM OF EXOGAMY OR MARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE CLAN AND THAT THIS RESTS ON CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT BLOOD WHICH AGAIN ARE TRACEABLE TO TOTEMISM A THEORY WHICH WE NEED NOT HERE DISCUSS
5688-41232-0025 DURKHEIM IS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE GROUP OF CONCEPTIONS THAT NOW CONCERN US HE INSISTS ON THE EXTREME AMBIGUITY FOUND IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE CONCERNING THE NOTION OF THE DIVINE AND THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN AVERSION AND VENERATION
5688-41232-0026 AND POINTS OUT THAT IT IS NOT ONLY AT PUBERTY AND EACH RECURRENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL EPOCH THAT WOMEN HAVE AROUSED THESE EMOTIONS BUT ALSO AT CHILDBIRTH A SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS HORROR HE CONTINUES
5688-41232-0027 WHICH CAN REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF INTENSITY WHICH CAN BE CALLED FORTH BY SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND REAPPEARS REGULARLY EVERY MONTH TO LAST FOR A WEEK AT LEAST CANNOT FAIL TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE PERIODS TO WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONFINED
5688-41232-0028 AND TO AFFECT THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE A BEING WHO MUST BE SECLUDED OR AVOIDED FOR WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS PRESERVES SOMETHING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS TO WHICH THE ISOLATION WAS DUE EVEN OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL PERIODS
5688-41232-0029 AND IN FACT IN THESE COMMUNITIES THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IS NOT MERELY INTERMITTENT IT HAS BECOME CHRONIC THE TWO ELEMENTS OF THE POPULATION LIVE SEPARATELY
5688-41232-0030 DURKHEIM PROCEEDS TO ARGUE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE OCCULT POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FEMININE ORGANISM IS TO BE FOUND IN PRIMITIVE IDEAS CONCERNING BLOOD NOT ONLY MENSTRUAL BLOOD BUT ANY KIND OF BLOOD IS THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS AMONG SAVAGE AND BARBAROUS PEOPLES
5688-41232-0031 THE PROHIBITION TO DRINK WINE THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE FOUND AMONG SOME PEOPLES IS TRACED TO ITS RESEMBLANCE TO BLOOD AND TO ITS SACRIFICIAL EMPLOYMENT AS AMONG THE ANCIENT ARABIANS AND STILL IN THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DRINKING BLOOD
5688-41232-0032 THROUGHOUT BLOOD IS GENERALLY TABOO AND IT TABOOS EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH IT NOW WOMAN IS CHRONICALLY THE THEATRE OF BLOODY MANIFESTATIONS AND THEREFORE SHE TENDS TO BECOME CHRONICALLY TABOO FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
5688-41232-0033 A MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUS ANXIETY A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS FEAR CANNOT FAIL TO ENTER INTO ALL THE RELATIONS OF HER COMPANIONS WITH HER AND THAT IS WHY ALL SUCH RELATIONS ARE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM RELATIONS OF A SEXUAL CHARACTER ARE SPECIALLY EXCLUDED
5688-41232-0034 IN THE FIRST PLACE SUCH RELATIONS ARE SO INTIMATE THAT THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SORT OF REPULSION WHICH THE SEXES MUST EXPERIENCE FOR EACH OTHER THE BARRIER BETWEEN THEM DOES NOT PERMIT OF SUCH A CLOSE UNION IN THE SECOND PLACE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY HERE SPECIALLY CONCERNED
5688-41232-0035 ARE PRECISELY THE SOURCE OF THE DREADED MANIFESTATIONS THUS IT IS NATURAL THAT THE FEELINGS OF AVERSION INSPIRED BY WOMEN ATTAIN THEIR GREATEST INTENSITY AT THIS POINT
5688-41232-0036 IN ANY CASE INDEED THE SAME IDEAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO WOMEN ALSO COITUS PRODUCES WEAKNESS AND IT PREVENTS THE ACQUISITION OF SUPERNATURAL POWERS THUS AMONG THE WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA BOAS STATES
5688-41232-0037 ONLY A YOUTH WHO HAS NEVER TOUCHED A WOMAN OR A VIRGIN
5688-41232-0038 AFTER HAVING HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE MEN AS WELL AS WOMEN
5688-41232-0039 YET THE TWOFOLD INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN REMAINS CLEAR WHEN WE REVIEW THE WHOLE GROUP OF INFLUENCES WHICH IN THIS STATE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO EXERT SHE BY NO MEANS ACTS ONLY BY PARALYZING SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND DESTROYING THE POWERS OF LIFE
5688-41232-0040 OH MENSTRUATING WOMAN THOU'RT A FIEND FROM WHOM ALL NATURE SHOULD BE CLOSELY SCREENED HER POWERS ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL
5688-41232-0041 IS IN REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STARRY BODIES
5688-41232-0042 IN OUR OWN TIME THE SLOW DISINTEGRATION OF PRIMITIVE ANIMISTIC CONCEPTIONS AIDED CERTAINLY BY THE DEGRADED CONCEPTION OF SEXUAL PHENOMENA TAUGHT BY MEDIAEVAL MONKS FOR WHOM WOMAN WAS TEMPLUM AEDIFICATUM SUPER CLOACAM
5688-41232-0043 HAS LED TO A DISBELIEF IN THE MORE SALUTARY INFLUENCES OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FAITH IN HER PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ALONE SURVIVES IT MAY BE TRACED EVEN IN PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIAL ONE MIGHT ADD MEDICAL QUARTERS
5688-41232-0044 IN THE GREAT SUGAR REFINERIES IN THE NORTH OF FRANCE THE REGULATIONS STRICTLY FORBID A WOMAN TO ENTER THE FACTORY WHILE THE SUGAR IS BOILING OR COOLING THE REASON GIVEN BEING THAT IF A WOMAN WERE TO ENTER DURING HER PERIOD THE SUGAR WOULD BLACKEN
5688-41232-0045 FOR THE SAME REASON TO TURN TO THE EAST NO WOMAN IS EMPLOYED IN THE OPIUM MANUFACTORY AT SAIGON IT BEING SAID THAT THE OPIUM WOULD TURN AND BECOME BITTER
5688-41232-0046 DECLARED THAT ONE OF THE WOMEN WORKERS MUST BE MENSTRUATING ALL THE WOMEN HINDUS MAHOMETANS ABORIGINAL GONDS ET CETERA SHOWED BY THEIR ENERGETIC DENIALS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THIS SUPERSTITION
5688-41232-0047 ASKING WHETHER IT WAS TRUE THAT IF A WOMAN CURED HAMS WHILE MENSTRUATING THE HAMS WOULD BE SPOILED HE HAD KNOWN THIS TO HAPPEN TWICE ANOTHER MEDICAL MAN WROTE THAT IF SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUATING LADY DOCTORS
5688-41232-0048 A THIRD WROTE IN THE JOURNAL FOR APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I THOUGHT THE FACT WAS SO GENERALLY KNOWN TO EVERY HOUSEWIFE AND COOK THAT MEAT WOULD SPOIL IF SALTED AT THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD THAT I AM SURPRISED TO SEE SO MANY LETTERS ON THE SUBJECT IN THE JOURNAL
5688-41232-0049 IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FACT THAT MEAT WILL BE TAINTED IF CURED BY WOMEN AT THE CATAMENIAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0050 HAVE THOUGHT AND TAUGHT THAT THE PRESENCE OF A MENSTRUATING WOMAN WOULD POLLUTE SOLEMN RELIGIOUS RITES WOULD SOUR MILK SPOIL THE FERMENTATION IN WINE VATS AND MUCH OTHER MISCHIEF IN A GENERAL WAY INFLUENCED BY HOARY TRADITION
5688-41232-0051 BUT WHY THIS DELAY IF TIME IS PRECIOUS AND IT ENTERS AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CASE
5688-41232-0052 FOR BEING SWOLLEN THEN BY THE AFFLUX OF BLOOD
5688-41232-0053 THAN BY CURETTING THE WOMB DURING THE VERY FLOW WHILE I DO NOT SELECT THIS PERIOD FOR THE REMOVAL OF OVARIAN CYSTS OR FOR OTHER ABDOMINAL WORK SUCH AS THE EXTIRPATION OF THE OVARIES OR A KIDNEY OR BREAKING UP INTESTINAL ADHESIONS ET CETERA
5688-41232-0054 YET I HAVE NOT HESITATED TO PERFORM THESE OPERATIONS AT SUCH A TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD REASON TO REGRET THE COURSE THE ONLY OPERATIONS THAT I SHOULD DISLIKE TO PERFORM DURING MENSTRUATION WOULD BE THOSE INVOLVING THE WOMB ITSELF
5688-41232-0055 IT MUST BE ADDED TO THIS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT MERELY THE SURVIVING INFLUENCE OF ANCIENT PRIMITIVE BELIEFS BUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ACTUAL NERVOUS CONDITIONS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0056 PRODUCING WHAT MAY BE DESCRIBED AS AN ABNORMAL NERVOUS TENSION IN THIS WAY WE ARE DOUBTLESS CONCERNED WITH A TISSUE OF PHENOMENA INEXTRICABLY WOVEN OF FOLK LORE AUTOSUGGESTION FALSE OBSERVATION
5688-41232-0057 THUS HE SPEAKS OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS OF ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN SLIGHTLY NEUROPATHIC BUT WITHOUT DEFINITE HYSTERICAL SYMPTOMS WHO DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD FEEL THEMSELVES IN A SORT OF ELECTRICAL STATE
5688-41232-0058 WITH TINGLING AND PRICKLING SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS OF ATTRACTION OR REPULSION AT THE CONTACT OF VARIOUS OBJECTS THESE GIRLS BELIEVE THEIR GARMENTS STICK TO THEIR SKIN DURING THE PERIODS IT WAS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THEY COULD REMOVE THEIR SLIPPERS THOUGH FITTING EASILY
5688-41232-0059 STOCKINGS HAD TO BE DRAWN OFF VIOLENTLY BY ANOTHER PERSON
5688-41232-0060 AN ORCHESTRAL PERFORMER ON THE DOUBLE BASS INFORMED LAURENT THAT WHENEVER HE LEFT A TUNED DOUBLE BASS IN HIS LODGINGS DURING HIS WIFE'S PERIOD A STRING SNAPPED CONSEQUENTLY HE ALWAYS REMOVED HIS INSTRUMENT AT THIS TIME TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE
5688-41232-0061 HE ADDED THAT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TWO YEARS EARLIER WITH A MISTRESS A CAFE CONCERT SINGER WHO HAD INDEED WARNED HIM BEFOREHAND A HARPIST ALSO INFORMED LAURENT THAT SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HER PROFESSION
5688-41232-0062 BECAUSE DURING HER PERIODS SEVERAL STRINGS OF HER HARP ALWAYS THE SAME STRINGS BROKE ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE WAS PLAYING A FRIEND OF LAURENT'S AN OFFICIAL IN COCHIN CHINA ALSO TOLD HIM THAT THE STRINGS OF HIS VIOLIN OFTEN SNAPPED DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIODS OF HIS ANNAMITE MISTRESS
5688-41232-0063 AND ARE CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AT THIS TIME TWO YOUNG LADIES BOTH GOOD VIOLINISTS ALSO AFFIRMED THAT EVER SINCE THEIR FIRST MENSTRUATION THEY HAD NOTED A TENDENCY FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP AT THIS PERIOD
5688-41232-0064 ONE A GENUINE ARTIST WHO OFTEN PERFORMED AT CHARITY CONCERTS SYSTEMATICALLY REFUSED TO PLAY AT THESE TIMES AND WAS OFTEN EMBARRASSED TO FIND A PRETEXT THE OTHER WHO ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE AT SUCH TIMES
5688-41232-0065 HAD GIVEN UP PLAYING ON ACCOUNT OF THE TROUBLE OF CHANGING THE STRINGS SO FREQUENTLY LAURENT ALSO REFERS TO THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH WOMEN BREAK THINGS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIODS AND CONSIDERS THAT THIS IS NOT SIMPLY DUE TO THE AWKWARDNESS CAUSED BY NERVOUS EXHAUSTION OR HYSTERICAL TREMORS
5688-41232-0066 BUT THAT THERE IS SPONTANEOUS BREAKAGE MOST USUALLY IT HAPPENS THAT A GLASS BREAKS WHEN IT IS BEING DRIED WITH A CLOTH NEEDLES ALSO BREAK WITH UNUSUAL FACILITY AT THIS TIME CLOCKS ARE STOPPED BY MERELY PLACING THE HAND UPON THEM
5688-41232-0067 I DO NOT HERE ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE CRITICALLY THE VALIDITY OF THESE ALLEGED MANIFESTATIONS SOME OF WHICH MAY CERTAINLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE UNCONSCIOUS MUSCULAR ACTION WHICH FORMS THE BASIS OF THE PHENOMENA OF TABLE TURNING AND THOUGHT READING
5688-41232-0068 SUCH A TASK MAY BEST BE UNDERTAKEN THROUGH THE MINUTE STUDY OF ISOLATED CASES AND IN THIS PLACE I AM MERELY CONCERNED WITH THE GENERAL INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUAL STATE
5688-41232-0069 IN AFFECTING THE SOCIAL POSITION OF WOMEN WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT GO TO MAKE UP THAT INFLUENCE THERE IS ONLY ONE FURTHER POINT TO WHICH ATTENTION MAY BE CALLED
5688-41232-0070 I ALLUDE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE MORE FAVORABLE SIDE OF THE PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AS PRIESTESS SIBYL PROPHETESS AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS AGENT FOR GOOD AN ANGEL THE PECULIAR HOME OF THE DIVINE ELEMENT
5688-41232-0071 THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF MENSTRUATION WITH THE IDEAS OF TABOO ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STATE SANK INTO THE BACKGROUND AS CULTURE EVOLVED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE IDEAS OF THE ANGELIC POSITION AND SPIRITUAL MISSION OF WOMEN
5688-41232-0072 THE MORE FAVORABLE ASPECT OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW OF WOMEN'S MAGIC FUNCTION HAS NEVER QUITE DIED OUT THE GRADUAL DECAY AND DEGRADATION OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW HAS ON THE WHOLE INVOLVED A LOWER ESTIMATE OF WOMEN'S NATURE AND POSITION
5688-41232-0073 WOMAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WITCH SHE WAS SO EVEN IN ANCIENT BABYLONIA BUT SHE HAS CEASED TO BE THE PRIESTESS THE EARLY TEUTONS SAW SANCTUM ALIQUID ET PROVIDUM IN WOMEN WHO FOR THE MEDIAEVAL GERMAN PREACHER
5688-41232-0074 AND SCHOPENHAUER AND EVEN NIETZSCHE HAVE BEEN MORE INCLINED TO SIDE WITH THE PREACHER THAN WITH THE HALF NAKED PHILOSOPHERS OF TACITUS'S DAY BUT BOTH VIEWS ALIKE ARE BUT THE EXTREMES OF THE SAME PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION
5688-41232-0075 AND THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION FROM ONE EXTREME OF THE MAGICAL DOCTRINE TO THE OTHER WAS INEVITABLE IN AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION AS WE SEE THESE IDEAS HAVING THEIR ULTIMATE BASIS ON THE OLD STORY OF THE SERPENT
5688-41232-0076 AND ON A SPECIAL AND MYSTERIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AND THE OCCULT FORCES OF MAGIC TEND TO DIE OUT THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES THEY INVOLVE BECOMES UNNECESSARY LIVING IN GREATER COMMUNITY WITH MEN
1992-141719-0000 THE QUEEN WAS RECEIV'D AT BABYLON WITH ALL THE TRANSPORTS OF JOY THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EXPRESS'D FOR THE SAFE RETURN OF SO ILLUSTRIOUS AND SO BEAUTIFUL A PERSONAGE THAT HAD RUN THRO SUCH A LONG SERIES OF MISFORTUNES
1992-141719-0001 BABYLON AT THAT TIME SEEM'D TO BE PERFECTLY SERENE AND QUIET AS FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE OF HYRCANIA HE WAS SLAIN IN BATTLE THE BABYLONIANS WHO WERE THE VICTORS
1992-141719-0002 WHO SHOULD GAIN IT BY A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL ELECTION THEY WERE DETERMIN'D THAT THE MOST VALUABLE POST OF HONOUR IN THE WORLD NAMELY
1992-141719-0003 AND THE SOVEREIGN OF BABYLON SHOULD BE THE RESULT OF MERIT ONLY AND NOT BE PROCUR'D BY ANY PARTY FACTIONS OR COURT INTRIGUES A SOLEMN OATH WAS VOLUNTARILY TAKEN BY ALL PARTIES
1992-141719-0004 THAT HE WHO SHOULD DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY HIS SUPERIOR VALOUR AND WISDOM SHOULD UNANIMOUSLY BE ACKNOWLEDG'D THE SOVEREIGN ELECT A SPACIOUS LIST OR CIRCUS WAS PITCHED UPON SURROUNDED WITH COMMODIOUS SEATS
1992-141719-0005 ERECTED IN AN AMPHITHEATRICAL MANNER AND RICHLY EMBELLISH'D SOME FEW LEAGUES FROM THE CITY THITHER THE COMBATANTS OR CHAMPIONS WERE TO REPAIR COMPLEATLY ACCOUTRED EACH OF THEM HAD A DISTINCT APARTMENT TO HIMSELF BEHIND THE LISTS
1992-141719-0006 WHERE NO SOUL COULD EITHER SEE THEM OR KNOW WHO THEY WERE THEY WERE TO ENTER THE LISTS FOUR SEVERAL TIMES THOSE WHO WERE SO HAPPY AS TO CONQUER FOUR COMPETITORS WERE AFTERWARDS TO ENGAGE EACH OTHER IN SINGLE COMBAT
1992-141719-0007 IN ORDER THAT HE WHO SHOULD REMAIN MASTER OF THE FIELD SHOULD BE PROCLAIM'D THE HAPPY VICTOR FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS THEY WERE TO MEET AGAIN ACCOUTRED AS BEFORE
1992-141719-0008 AND TO EXPLAIN ALL SUCH A ENIGMAS OR RIDDLES AS THE MAGI SHOULD THINK PROPER TO PROPOSE IF THEIR QUERIES SHOULD PROVE TOO INTRICATE AND PERPLEXT FOR THEM TO RESOLVE THEY WERE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE LISTS AGAIN AND AFTER THAT TO FRESH A ENIGMAS
1992-141719-0009 BEFORE THEY COULD BE ENTITLED TO THE ELECTION SO THAT THE TOURNAMENTS WERE TO BE CONTINU'D TILL ONE OF THE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE TWICE A VICTOR AND SHINE AS CONSPICUOUS WITH RESPECT TO HIS INTERNAL QUALITIES AS TO HIS DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS IN HEROIC ATCHIEVEMENTS
1992-141719-0010 THE QUEEN IN THE MEAN TIME WAS TO BE NARROWLY WATCH'D AND ALLOW'D ONLY TO BE A SPECTATOR OF BOTH THEIR AMUSEMENTS AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND MOREOVER TO BE COVER'D WITH A VAIL
1992-141719-0011 NOR WAS SHE INDULG'D SO FAR AS TO SPEAK ONE SINGLE WORD TO ANY CANDIDATE WHOMSOEVER IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE LEAST JEALOUSY OR SUSPICION EITHER OF PARTIALITY OR INJUSTICE
1992-141719-0012 TO INFORM HER LOVER OF ALL THE PRELIMINARY ARTICLES ABOVEMENTION'D NOT DOUBTING BUT THAT HE WOULD EXERT BOTH HIS COURAGE AND UNDERSTANDING FOR HER SAKE BEYOND ANY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS ZADIG ACCORDINGLY SET OUT FOR BABYLON AND BESOUGHT THE GODDESS VENUS
1992-141719-0013 NOT ONLY TO FORTIFY HIS COURAGE BUT TO ILLUMINATE HIS MIND WITH WISDOM ON THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION THE NIGHT BEFORE THESE MARTIAL ATCHIEVEMENTS WERE TO COMMENCE ZADIG ARRIVED UPON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES
1992-141719-0014 HE INSCRIB'D HIS DEVICE AMONGST THE LIST OF COMBATANTS CONCEALING AT THE SAME TIME BOTH HIS PERSON AND NAME AS THE LAWS OF THE ELECTION REQUIRED AND ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW TO THE APARTMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIM
1992-141719-0015 ACCORDING TO HIS LOT CADOR WHO WAS JUST RETURN'D TO BABYLON HAVING HUNTED ALL EGYPT OVER TO NO PURPOSE IN HOPES TO FIND HIS FRIEND ZADIG BROUGHT A COMPLEAT SET OF ARMOUR INTO HIS LODGE BY EXPRESS ORDERS FROM THE QUEEN
1992-141719-0016 SHE SENT HIM LIKEWISE ONE OF THE FINEST HORSES IN ALL PERSIA
1992-141719-0017 WHICH REDOUBLED HIS VIGOUR AND HIS HOPES THE NEXT MORNING THE QUEEN BEING SEATED UNDER A CANOPY OF STATE ENRICH'D WITH PRECIOUS STONES AND THE AMPHITHEATRES BEING CROWDED WITH GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF ALL RANKS AND CONDITIONS FROM BABYLON
1992-141719-0018 THE COMPETITORS MADE THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE IN THE CIRCUS EACH OF THEM WENT UP TO THE GRAND MAGUS AND LAID DOWN HIS PARTICULAR DEVICE AT HIS FEET THE DEVICES WERE DRAWN BY LOT THAT OF ZADIG WAS THE LAST
1992-141719-0019 ONE ITABOD BY NAME IMMENSELY RICH INDEED AND VERY HAUGHTY
1992-141719-0020 EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD AND A MAN OF NO ACQUIR'D PARTS THE SYCOPHANTS THAT HOVER'D ROUND ABOUT HIM FLATTER'D HIM THAT A MAN OF HIS MERIT COULDN'T FAIL OF BEING KING HE IMPERIOUSLY REPLIED ONE OF MY MERIT MUST BE KING
1992-141719-0021 HIS ARMOUR WAS MADE OF PURE GOLD ENAMELL'D WITH GREEN THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE GREEN AND HIS LANCE EMBELLISH'D WITH GREEN RIBBANDS EVERY ONE WAS SENSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT
1992-141719-0022 BY ITOBAD'S MANNER OF MANAGING HIS HORSE THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN WHOM HEAV'N HAD PITCH'D UPON TO SWAY THE BABYLONISH SCEPTER THE FIRST COMBATANT THAT TILTED WITH HIM THREW HIM OUT OF THE SADDLE THE SECOND FLUNG HIM QUITE OVER THE CRUPPER
1992-141719-0023 AND LAID HIM SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEELS QUIV'RING IN THE AIR ITOBAD TIS TRUE REMOUNTED BUT WITH SO ILL A GRACE
1992-141719-0024 THE THIRD DISDAINING TO USE HIS LANCE MADE ONLY A FEINT AT HIM THEN CATCH'D HOLD OF HIS RIGHT LEG AND WHIRLING HIM ROUND THREW HIM FLAT UPON THE SAND THE ESQUIRES WHO WERE THE ATTENDANTS RAN TO HIS ASSISTANCE
1992-141719-0025 AND WITH A SNEER REMOUNTED HIM THE FOURTH COMBATANT CATCH'D HOLD OF HIS LEFT LEG AND UNHORS'D HIM AGAIN HE WAS CONVEY'D THRO THE HISSING MULTITUDE TO HIS LODGE WHERE ACCORDING TO THE LAW IN THAT CASE PROVIDED HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT
1992-141719-0026 AND AS HE HOBBLED ALONG SAID HE TO THE ESQUIRES WHAT A SAD MISFORTUNE IS THIS TO ONE OF MY BIRTH AND CHARACTER THE OTHER CHAMPIONS PLAY'D THEIR PARTS MUCH BETTER AND ALL CAME OFF WITH CREDIT
1992-141719-0027 SOME CONQUER'D TWO OF THEIR ANTAGONISTS AND OTHERS WERE SO FAR SUCCESSFUL AS TO GET THE BETTER OF THREE NONE OF THEM HOWEVER EXCEPT PRINCE HOTTAM VANQUISH'D FOUR ZADIG AT LAST
1992-141719-0028 ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH THE UTMOST EASE AND WITH SUCH AN AIR AND GRACE AS GAIN'D HIM UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AS THE CASE STOOD THUS ZADIG AND HOTTAM WERE TO CLOSE THE DAY'S ENTERTAINMENT IN A SINGLE COMBAT
1992-141719-0029 THE ARMOUR OF THE LATTER WAS OF A BLUE COLOUR MIXT WITH GOLD AND THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE OF THE SAME THOSE OF THE FORMER WHITE AS SNOW THE MULTITUDE WERE DIVIDED IN THEIR WISHES THE KNIGHT IN BLUE WAS THE FAVOURITE OF SOME OF THE LADIES
1992-141719-0030 THE QUEEN WHOSE HEART WAS IN A PERFECT PALPITATION PUT UP HER SECRET PRAYERS TO VENUS TO ASSIST HER DARLING HERO THE TWO CHAMPIONS MAKING THEIR PASSES AND THEIR VOLTA'S WITH THE UTMOST DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS
1992-141719-0031 AND KEEPING FIRM IN THEIR SADDLES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH REBUFFS WITH THEIR LANCES THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS THE QUEEN ONLY EXCEPTED WISH'D FOR TWO KINGS OF BABYLON AT LAST THEIR HORSES BEING TIRED AND BOTH THEIR LANCES BROKE
1992-141719-0032 ZADIG MADE USE OF THE FOLLOWING STRATAGEM
1992-141719-0033 HE GOT ARTFULLY BEHIND HIM AND SHOOTING WITH A SPRING ON HIS HORSES BUTTOCKS GRASP'D HIM CLOSE THREW HIM HEADLONG ON THE SAND THEN JUMP'D INTO HIS SEAT AND WHEEL'D ROUND PRINCE HOTTAM WHILE HE LAY SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND ALL THE SPECTATORS IN GENERAL
1992-141719-0034 WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS CRIED OUT VICTORY VICTORY IN FAVOUR OF THE CHAMPION IN WHITE
1992-141719-0035 INCENS'D TO THE LAST DEGREE GOT UP AND DREW HIS SWORD ZADIG SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE WITH HIS SABRE IN HIS HAND NOW BEHOLD THE TWO CHIEFTAINS UPON THEIR LEGS COMMENCING A NEW TRIAL OF SKILL WHERE THEY SEEM'D TO GET THE BETTER OF EACH OTHER ALTERNATELY
1992-141719-0036 FOR BOTH WERE STRONG AND BOTH WERE ACTIVE THE FEATHERS OF THEIR HELMETS THE STUDS OF THEIR BRACELETS THEIR COATS OF MAIL FLEW ABOUT IN PIECES THRO THE DRY BLOWS WHICH THEY A THOUSAND TIMES REPEATED THEY STRUCK AT EACH OTHER SOMETIMES WITH THE EDGE OF THEIR SWORDS
1992-141719-0037 AT OTHER TIMES THEY PUSH'D AS OCCASION OFFER'D NOW ON THE RIGHT THEN ON THE LEFT NOW ON THE HEAD THEN AT THE BREAST THEY RETREATED THEY ADVANC'D THEY KEPT AT A DISTANCE THEY CLOS'D AGAIN
1992-141719-0038 THEIR SWORDS STRUCK FIRE ALMOST AT EVERY BLOW AT LAST ZADIG IN ORDER TO RECOVER HIS BREATH FOR A MOMENT OR TWO STOOD STILL AND AFTERWARDS MAKING A FEINT AT THE PRINCE THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AND DISARM'D HIM HOTTAM THEREUPON
1992-141719-0039 CRIED OUT O THOU KNIGHT OF THE WHITE ARMOUR TIS YOU ONLY ARE DESTIN'D TO BE THE KING OF BABYLON THE QUEEN WAS PERFECTLY TRANSPORTED THE TWO CHAMPIONS WERE RECONDUCTED TO THEIR SEPARATE LODGES AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN BEFORE THEM IN CONFORMITY TO THE LAWS PRESCRIB'D
1992-141719-0040 SEVERAL MUTES WERE ORDER'D TO WAIT ON THE CHAMPIONS AND CARRY THEM SOME PROPER REFRESHMENT WE'LL LEAVE THE READER TO JUDGE WHETHER THE QUEEN'S DWARF WAS NOT APPOINTED TO WAIT ON ZADIG ON THIS HAPPY OCCASION AFTER SUPPER THE MUTES WITHDREW
1992-141719-0041 AND LEFT THE COMBATANTS TO REST THEIR WEARIED LIMBS TILL THE NEXT MORNING AT WHICH TIME THE VICTOR WAS TO PRODUCE HIS DEVICE BEFORE THE GRAND MAGUS IN ORDER TO CONFER NOTES AND DISCOVER THE HERO WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE ZADIG SLEPT VERY SOUND
1992-141719-0042 NOTWITHSTANDING HIS AMOROUS REGARD FOR THE QUEEN BEING PERFECTLY FATIGU'D ITABOD WHO LAY IN THE LODGE CONTIGUOUS TO HIS COULD NOT ONCE CLOSE HIS EYES FOR VEXATION HE GOT UP THEREFORE IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT STOLE IMPERCEPTIBLY INTO ZADIG'S APARTMENT
1992-141719-0043 TOOK HIS WHITE ARMOUR AND DEVICE AWAY WITH HIM AND SUBSTITUTED HIS GREEN ONE IN ITS PLACE AS SOON AS THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN HE REPAIR'D WITH A SEEMINGLY UNDAUNTED COURAGE TO THE GRAND MAGUS TO INFORM HIM THAT HE WAS THE MIGHTY HERO THE HAPPY VICTOR
1992-141719-0044 AND WAS PROCLAIM'D VICTOR BEFORE ZADIG WAS AWAKE
1992-141719-0045 RETURN'D WITH A HEART OVERWHELM'D WITH DESPAIR TO THE COURT OF BABYLON
1992-141719-0046 HE WAS OBLIG'D THO SORELY AGAINST HIS WILL TO PUT IT ON HAVING NOTHING ELSE IN HIS LODGE TO APPEAR IN CONFOUNDED AND BIG WITH RESENTMENT
1992-141719-0047 THE POPULACE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND IN THE CIRCUS HISS'D HIM EVERY STEP HE TOOK THEY MADE A RING ABOUT HIM AND TREATED HIM WITH ALL THE MARKS OF IGNOMINY AND CONTEMPT THE MOST COWARDLY WRETCH BREATHING WAS NEVER SURE SO SWEATED OR HUNTED DOWN AS POOR ZADIG
1992-141719-0048 HE GREW QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE AT LAST AND CUT HIS WAY THRO THE INSULTING MOB WITH HIS RIVAL'S SABRE BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT MEASURES TO PURSUE OR HOW TO RECTIFY SO GROSS A MISTAKE IT WAS NOT IN HIS POWER TO HAVE A SIGHT OF THE QUEEN
1992-141719-0049 HE COULD NEVER RECOVER THE WHITE ARMOUR AGAIN WHICH SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE OR THE ENGAGEMENT TO WHICH THE COMBATANTS HAD ALL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THUS AS HE WAS ON THE ONE HAND PLUNG'D IN AN ABYSS OF SORROW
1992-141719-0050 SO ON THE OTHER HE WAS ALMOST DROVE DISTRACTED WITH VEXATION AND RESENTMENT HE WITHDREW THEREFORE IN A SOLITARY MOOD TO THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES NOW FULLY PERSUADED
1992-141719-0051 THAT HIS IMPROPITIOUS STAR HAD SHED ITS MOST BALEFUL INFLUENCE ON HIM AND THAT HIS MISFORTUNES WERE IRRETRIEVABLE REVOLVING IN HIS MIND ALL HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS FROM HIS FIRST ADVENTURE WITH THE COURT COQUET
1992-141719-0052 DOWN TO HIS LATE LOSS OF HIS WHITE ARMOUR SEE SAID HE THE FATAL CONSEQUENCE OF BEING A SLUGGARD
1992-141719-0053 ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOOKS OR MANKIND ALL THE PERSONAL VALOUR THAT I CAN BOAST OF HAS ONLY PROV'D AN AGGRAVATION OF MY SORROWS HE CARRIED THE POINT SO FAR AT LAST AS TO MURMUR AT THE UNEQUAL DISPENSATIONS OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE
1992-141719-0054 AND WAS TEMPTED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OCCURRENCES WERE GOVERN'D BY A MALIGNANT DESTINY WHICH NEVER FAIL'D TO OPPRESS THE VIRTUOUS AND ALWAYS CROWN'D THE ACTIONS OF SUCH VILLAINS AS THE GREEN KNIGHT WITH UNCOMMON SUCCESS IN ONE OF HIS FRANTICK FITS
1992-141719-0055 HE PUT ON THE GREEN ARMOUR THAT HAD CREATED HIM SUCH A WORLD OF DISGRACE A MERCHANT HAPPENING TO PASS BY HE SOLD IT TO HIM FOR A TRIFLE AND TOOK IN EXCHANGE NOTHING MORE THAN A MANTLE AND A CAP
4397-15668-0000 YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
4397-15668-0001 BUT YOU MAY NOT SEE A SINGLE TRUE LILY AND ONLY A VERY FEW LILIACEOUS PLANTS OF ANY KIND NOT EVEN IN THE COOL FRESH GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL YOU FIND THESE FAVORITE FLOWERS THOUGH SOME OF THESE DESERT RANGES ALMOST RIVAL THE SIERRA IN HEIGHT
4397-15668-0002 NEVERTHELESS IN THE BUILDING AND PLANTING OF THIS GRAND TERRITORY THE LILIES WERE NOT FORGOTTEN FAR BACK IN THE DIM GEOLOGIC AGES WHEN THE SEDIMENTS OF THE OLD SEAS WERE BEING GATHERED AND OUTSPREAD IN SMOOTH SHEETS LIKE LEAVES OF A BOOK
4397-15668-0003 AND WHEN THESE SEDIMENTS BECAME DRY LAND AND WERE BAKED AND CRUMBLED INTO THE SKY AS MOUNTAIN RANGES WHEN THE LAVA FLOODS OF THE FIRE PERIOD WERE BEING LAVISHLY POURED FORTH FROM INNUMERABLE RIFTS AND CRATERS
4397-15668-0004 WHEN THE ICE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD WAS LAID LIKE A MANTLE OVER EVERY MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY THROUGHOUT ALL THESE IMMENSELY PROTRACTED PERIODS IN THE THRONG OF THESE MAJESTIC OPERATIONS NATURE KEPT HER FLOWER CHILDREN IN MIND SHE CONSIDERED THE LILIES
4397-15668-0005 AND WHILE PLANTING THE PLAINS WITH SAGE AND THE HILLS WITH CEDAR SHE HAS COVERED AT LEAST ONE MOUNTAIN WITH GOLDEN ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS AS ITS CROWNING GLORY AS IF WILLING TO SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THE LILY LINE EVEN HERE
4397-15668-0006 LOOKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTH END OF SALT LAKE THE TWO NORTHMOST PEAKS OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE ARE SEEN SWELLING CALMLY INTO THE COOL SKY WITHOUT ANY MARKED CHARACTER EXCEPTING ONLY THEIR SNOW CROWNS
4397-15668-0007 AND A FEW WEEDY LOOKING PATCHES OF SPRUCE AND FIR THE SIMPLICITY OF THEIR SLOPES PREVENTING THEIR REAL LOFTINESS FROM BEING APPRECIATED GRAY SAGEY PLAINS CIRCLE AROUND THEIR BASES AND UP TO A HEIGHT OF A THOUSAND FEET OR MORE THEIR SIDES ARE TINGED WITH PURPLE
4397-15668-0008 AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
4397-15668-0009 I WILL BATHE IN THE HIGH SKY AMONG COOL WIND WAVES FROM THE SNOW FROM THE MORE SOUTHERLY OF THE TWO PEAKS A LONG RIDGE COMES DOWN BENT LIKE A BOW ONE END IN THE HOT PLAINS THE OTHER IN THE SNOW OF THE SUMMIT
4397-15668-0010 AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
4397-15668-0011 I WAS ANIMATED BY A MOUNTAINEER'S EAGERNESS TO GET MY FEET INTO THE SNOW ONCE MORE AND MY HEAD INTO THE CLEAR SKY AFTER LYING DORMANT ALL WINTER AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BUT IN EVERY WALK WITH NATURE ONE RECEIVES FAR MORE THAN HE SEEKS
4397-15668-0012 I HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN A MILE FROM LAKE POINT ERE I FOUND THE WAY PROFUSELY DECKED WITH FLOWERS MOSTLY COMPOSITAE AND PURPLE LEGUMINOSAE A HUNDRED COROLLAS OR MORE TO THE SQUARE YARD WITH A CORRESPONDING ABUNDANCE OF WINGED BLOSSOMS ABOVE THEM MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES
4397-15668-0013 TWO LILIACEOUS PLANTS IN PARTICULAR ERYTHRONIUM GRANDIFLORUM AND FRITILLARIA PUDICA ARE MARVELOUSLY BEAUTIFUL AND ABUNDANT
4397-15668-0014 NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY WALKS HAVE I MET SO GLORIOUS A THRONG OF THESE FINE SHOWY LILIACEOUS PLANTS THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WAS AGLOW WITH THEM FROM A HEIGHT OF FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW
4397-15668-0015 ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
4397-15668-0016 AS IF ATTRACTED BY THE RINGING OF THEIR BELLS THEY WERE GROWING IN A SMALL NESTLIKE OPENING BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE BUSHES AND BOTH THE ERYTHRONIUM AND THE FRITILLARIA WERE IN FULL FLOWER THESE WERE THE FIRST OF THE SPECIES I HAD SEEN
4397-15668-0017 AND I NEED NOT TRY TO TELL THE JOY THEY MADE THEY ARE BOTH LOWLY PLANTS LOWLY AS VIOLETS THE TALLEST SELDOM EXCEEDING SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT SO THAT THE MOST SEARCHING WINDS THAT SWEEP THE MOUNTAINS SCARCE REACH LOW ENOUGH TO SHAKE THEIR BELLS
4397-15668-0018 THE PETALS BEING STRONGLY RECURVED LIKE THOSE OF LILIUM SUPERBUM OCCASIONALLY A SPECIMEN IS MET WHICH HAS FROM TWO TO FIVE FLOWERS HUNG IN A LOOSE PANICLE PEOPLE OFTENTIMES TRAVEL FAR TO SEE CURIOUS PLANTS LIKE THE CARNIVOROUS DARLINGTONIA
4397-15668-0019 THE FLY CATCHER THE WALKING FERN ET CETERA I HARDLY KNOW HOW THE LITTLE BELLS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WOULD BE REGARDED BY SEEKERS OF THIS CLASS BUT EVERY TRUE FLOWER LOVER WHO COMES TO CONSIDER THESE UTAH LILIES WILL SURELY BE WELL REWARDED HOWEVER LONG THE WAY
4397-15668-0020 PUSHING ON UP THE RUGGED SLOPES I FOUND MANY DELIGHTFUL SECLUSIONS MOIST NOOKS AT THE FOOT OF CLIFFS AND LILIES IN EVERY ONE OF THEM NOT GROWING CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE DAISIES BUT WELL APART WITH PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEIR BELLS TO SWING FREE AND RING
4397-15668-0021 I FOUND HUNDREDS OF THEM IN FULL BLOOM WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE SNOW IN WINTER ONLY THE BULBS ARE ALIVE SLEEPING DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND LIKE FIELD MICE IN THEIR NESTS THEN THE SNOW FLOWERS FALL ABOVE THEM LILIES OVER LILIES
4397-15668-0022 UNTIL THE SPRING WINDS BLOW AND THESE WINTER LILIES WITHER IN TURN THEN THE HIDING ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS RISE AGAIN RESPONSIVE TO THE FIRST TOUCHES OF THE SUN I NOTICED THE TRACKS OF DEER IN MANY PLACES AMONG THE LILY GARDENS
4397-15668-0023 AND AT THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FEET I CAME UPON THE FRESH TRAIL OF A FLOCK OF WILD SHEEP SHOWING THAT THESE FINE MOUNTAINEERS STILL FLOURISH HERE ABOVE THE RANGE OF MORMON RIFLES IN THE PLANTING OF HER WILD GARDENS
4397-15668-0024 NATURE TAKES THE FEET AND TEETH OF HER FLOCKS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAKES USE OF THEM TO TRIM AND CULTIVATE AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AS THE BARK AND BUDS OF THE TREE ARE TENDED BY WOODPECKERS AND LINNETS THE EVERGREEN WOODS CONSIST AS FAR AS I OBSERVED OF TWO SPECIES
4397-15668-0025 A SPRUCE AND A FIR STANDING CLOSE TOGETHER ERECT AND ARROWY IN A THRIFTY COMPACT GROWTH BUT THEY ARE QUITE SMALL SAY FROM SIX TO TWELVE OR FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND BOUT FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AMONG THEIR GIANT RELATIVES OF THE SIERRA
4397-15668-0026 SNOWY ICE SCULPTURED RANGES BOUNDED THE HORIZON ALL AROUND WHILE THE GREAT LAKE EIGHTY MILES LONG AND FIFTY MILES WIDE LAY FULLY REVEALED BENEATH A LILY SKY
4397-15668-0027 AND THE WIDE PRAIRIE OF WATER GLOWING IN THE GOLD AND PURPLE OF EVENING PRESENTED ALL THE COLORS THAT TINT THE LIPS OF SHELLS AND THE PETALS OF LILIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKE THIS SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS UTAH LAKE
4397-15668-0028 LYING THIRTY FIVE MILES TO THE SOUTH WAS IN FULL SIGHT ALSO AND THE RIVER JORDAN WHICH LINKS THE TWO TOGETHER MAY BE TRACED IN SILVERY GLEAMS THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE COURSE
4397-15668-0029 THE GRANDEST I HAD CARRIED IN MANY A DAY I REACHED THE HOTEL ON THE LAKE ABOUT DUSK WITH ALL MY FRESH RICHES AND MY FIRST MOUNTAIN RAMBLE IN UTAH WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON MY WAY BACK TO THE CITY THE NEXT DAY
4397-15668-0030 I SHOOK MY BIG HANDFUL OF LILIES IN HIS FACE AND SHOUTED HERE ARE THE TRUE SAINTS ANCIENT AND LATTER DAY ENDURING FOREVER
4397-15668-0031 HE SAID THEY ARE NICE
4397-15668-0032 ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
4397-15668-0033 AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0034 FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
4397-15668-0035 AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0036 OFTEN CURIOUSLY FRECKLED LIKE THE PETALS OF FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA THEY ARE FRUIT RATHER THAN FLOWER GOOD BROWN BREAD BUT DOWN IN THE SAN PITCH VALLEY AT GUNNISON I DISCOVERED A GENUINE LILY HAPPILY NAMED LILY YOUNG
4397-15668-0037 SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRIGHAM YOUNG SLENDER AND GRACEFUL WITH LILY WHITE CHEEKS TINTED WITH CLEAR ROSE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE OLD SALT LAKE ZION HOUSE BUT BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE
4397-15668-0038 HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
4397-15668-0039 HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
4397-15678-0000 AS ONE STROLLS IN THE WOODS ABOUT THE LOGGING CAMPS MOST OF THE LUMBERMEN ARE FOUND TO BE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO MEET KIND AND OBLIGING AND SINCERE FULL OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE BARK AND SAPWOOD AND HEARTWOOD OF THE TREES THEY CUT AND HOW TO FELL THEM WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BREAKAGE
4397-15678-0001 A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
4397-15678-0002 MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
4397-15678-0003 HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
4397-15678-0004 OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
4397-15678-0005 UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
4397-15678-0006 AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
4397-15678-0007 NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
4397-15678-0008 TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
4397-15678-0009 AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0010 AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
4397-15678-0011 HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
4397-15678-0012 AND THESE TWO ARE KEEN ACTIVE RIVALS TO ALL APPEARANCES WELL MATCHED TACOMA OCCUPIES NEAR THE HEAD OF THE SOUND A SITE OF GREAT NATURAL BEAUTY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND CALLS ITSELF THE CITY OF DESTINY
4397-15678-0013 SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0014 AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
4397-15678-0015 PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
4397-15678-0016 PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0017 AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
4397-15678-0018 OX DRIVERS AND LOGGERS IN STIFF GUMMY OVERALLS BACK SLANTING DUDES WELL TAILORED AND SHINY AND FASHIONS AND BONNETS OF EVERY FEATHER AND COLOR BLOOM GAYLY IN THE NOISY THRONG AND ADVERTISE LONDON AND PARIS
4397-15678-0019 VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0020 RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
4397-15678-0021 A DIM NEBULOUS EXPANSE OF WOODS BY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT RAILROADS AND STEAMERS HAVE BROUGHT THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE WILDERNESS AND ABOLISHED THE OLD DISTANCES IT IS NOW NEAR TO ALL THE WORLD AND IS IN POSSESSION OF A SHARE OF THE BEST OF ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HAS TO OFFER
4397-15678-0022 WHILE ON SOME OF THE LINES OF ADVANCEMENT IT IS AT THE FRONT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHARP RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND TOWNS THE LEADING MEN MOSTLY PULL TOGETHER FOR THE GENERAL GOOD AND GLORY
4397-15678-0023 BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4397-15678-0024 THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0025 HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
4397-15678-0026 THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
4397-15678-0027 SOME GO BOATING ON THE SOUND OR ON THE LAKES AND RIVERS OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE EXCURSIONS AT SMALL COST ON THE STEAMERS OTHERS WILL TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE FRANKLIN AND NEWCASTLE OR CARBON RIVER COAL MINES FOR THE SAKE OF THE THIRTY OR FORTY MILE RIDES THROUGH THE WOODS
4397-15678-0028 AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
4397-15678-0029 GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
4397-15678-0030 THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
4397-15678-0031 HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
4397-15678-0032 ON THE PORTIONS MOST EASILY CLEARED SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF HOP VINES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND ARE NOW IN FULL BEARING YIELDING IT IS SAID AT THE RATE OF ABOUT A TON OF HOPS TO THE ACRE THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROP THESE VINES OF THE NORTH
4397-15678-0033 PILLARS OF VERDURE IN REGULAR ROWS SEVEN FEET APART AND EIGHT OR TEN FEET IN HEIGHT THE LONG VIGOROUS SHOOTS SWEEPING ROUND IN FINE WILD FREEDOM AND THE LIGHT LEAFY CONES HANGING IN LOOSE HANDSOME CLUSTERS PERHAPS ENOUGH OF HOPS
4397-15678-0034 MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
4397-15678-0035 STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
4397-15678-0036 BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
4397-15678-0037 AND FINE VIEWS OF THE FALL MAY BE HAD ON THAT SIDE BOTH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW IT IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN RIVER WHERE IT PLUNGES OVER A SHEER PRECIPICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH IN LEAVING THE LEVEL MEADOWS OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BASIN
4397-15678-0038 THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
4397-15678-0039 SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
4397-15678-0040 THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0041 AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
4397-15678-0042 WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
4397-15678-0043 THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
2893-139322-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE UNDER SIDE FROM THE BUSINESS QUARTER THEY PRESENTLY PASSED BY THE RUNNING WAYS INTO A REMOTE QUARTER OF THE CITY WHERE THE BULK OF THE MANUFACTURES WAS DONE
2893-139322-0001 ON THEIR WAY THE PLATFORMS CROSSED THE THAMES TWICE AND PASSED IN A BROAD VIADUCT ACROSS ONE OF THE GREAT ROADS THAT ENTERED THE CITY FROM THE NORTH IN BOTH CASES HIS IMPRESSION WAS SWIFT AND IN BOTH VERY VIVID
2893-139322-0002 THE RIVER WAS A BROAD WRINKLED GLITTER OF BLACK SEA WATER OVERARCHED BY BUILDINGS AND VANISHING EITHER WAY INTO A BLACKNESS STARRED WITH RECEDING LIGHTS A STRING OF BLACK BARGES PASSED SEAWARD MANNED BY BLUE CLAD MEN
2893-139322-0003 THE ROAD WAS A LONG AND VERY BROAD AND HIGH TUNNEL ALONG WHICH BIG WHEELED MACHINES DROVE NOISELESSLY AND SWIFTLY HERE TOO THE DISTINCTIVE BLUE OF THE LABOUR DEPARTMENT WAS IN ABUNDANCE THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE DOUBLE TRACKS
2893-139322-0004 STRUCK GRAHAM MOST VIVIDLY ONE LANK AND VERY HIGH CARRIAGE WITH LONGITUDINAL METALLIC RODS HUNG WITH THE DRIPPING CARCASSES OF MANY HUNDRED SHEEP ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION UNDULY ABRUPTLY THE EDGE OF THE ARCHWAY CUT
2893-139322-0005 AND BLOTTED OUT THE PICTURE PRESENTLY THEY LEFT THE WAY AND DESCENDED BY A LIFT AND TRAVERSED A PASSAGE THAT SLOPED DOWNWARD AND SO CAME TO A DESCENDING LIFT AGAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS CHANGED EVEN THE PRETENCE OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT DISAPPEARED
2893-139322-0006 THE LIGHTS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER AND SIZE THE ARCHITECTURE BECAME MORE AND MORE MASSIVE IN PROPORTION TO THE SPACES AS THE FACTORY QUARTERS WERE REACHED AND IN THE DUSTY BISCUIT MAKING PLACE OF THE POTTERS AMONG THE FELSPAR MILLS IN THE FURNACE ROOMS OF THE METAL WORKERS
2893-139322-0007 THE BLUE CANVAS CLOTHING WAS ON MAN WOMAN AND CHILD MANY OF THESE GREAT AND DUSTY GALLERIES WERE SILENT AVENUES OF MACHINERY ENDLESS RAKED OUT ASHEN FURNACES TESTIFIED TO THE REVOLUTIONARY DISLOCATION
2893-139322-0008 BUT WHEREVER THERE WAS WORK IT WAS BEING DONE BY SLOW MOVING WORKERS IN BLUE CANVAS THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT IN BLUE CANVAS WERE THE OVERLOOKERS OF THE WORK PLACES AND THE ORANGE CLAD LABOUR POLICE AND FRESH FROM THE FLUSHED FACES OF THE DANCING HALLS
2893-139322-0009 THE VOLUNTARY VIGOURS OF THE BUSINESS QUARTER GRAHAM COULD NOTE THE PINCHED FACES THE FEEBLE MUSCLES AND WEARY EYES OF MANY OF THE LATTER DAY WORKERS SUCH AS HE SAW AT WORK WERE NOTICEABLY INFERIOR IN PHYSIQUE TO THE FEW GAILY DRESSED MANAGERS AND FOREWOMEN
2893-139322-0010 WHO WERE DIRECTING THEIR LABOURS THE BURLY LABOURERS OF THE OLD VICTORIAN TIMES HAD FOLLOWED THAT DRAY HORSE AND ALL SUCH LIVING FORCE PRODUCERS TO EXTINCTION THE PLACE OF HIS COSTLY MUSCLES WAS TAKEN BY SOME DEXTEROUS MACHINE
2893-139322-0011 THE LATTER DAY LABOURER MALE AS WELL AS FEMALE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MACHINE MINDER AND FEEDER A SERVANT AND ATTENDANT OR AN ARTIST UNDER DIRECTION THE WOMEN IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE GRAHAM REMEMBERED
2893-139322-0012 WERE AS A CLASS DISTINCTLY PLAIN AND FLAT CHESTED TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF EMANCIPATION FROM THE MORAL RESTRAINTS OF PURITANICAL RELIGION TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF CITY LIFE HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN ELIMINATING THE STRAIN OF FEMININE BEAUTY AND VIGOUR FROM THE BLUE CANVAS MYRIADS
2893-139322-0013 TO BE BRILLIANT PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY TO BE IN ANY WAY ATTRACTIVE OR EXCEPTIONAL HAD BEEN AND WAS STILL A CERTAIN WAY OF EMANCIPATION TO THE DRUDGE A LINE OF ESCAPE TO THE PLEASURE CITY AND ITS SPLENDOURS AND DELIGHTS AND AT LAST
2893-139322-0014 TO THE EUTHANASY AND PEACE TO BE STEADFAST AGAINST SUCH INDUCEMENTS WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED OF MEANLY NOURISHED SOULS IN THE YOUNG CITIES OF GRAHAM'S FORMER LIFE THE NEWLY AGGREGATED LABOURING MASS
2893-139322-0015 HAD BEEN A DIVERSE MULTITUDE STILL STIRRED BY THE TRADITION OF PERSONAL HONOUR AND A HIGH MORALITY NOW IT WAS DIFFERENTIATING INTO AN INSTINCT CLASS WITH A MORAL AND PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE OF ITS OWN EVEN WITH A DIALECT OF ITS OWN
2893-139322-0016 THEY PENETRATED DOWNWARD EVER DOWNWARD TOWARDS THE WORKING PLACES PRESENTLY THEY PASSED UNDERNEATH ONE OF THE STREETS OF THE MOVING WAYS AND SAW ITS PLATFORMS RUNNING ON THEIR RAILS FAR OVERHEAD AND CHINKS OF WHITE LIGHTS BETWEEN THE TRANSVERSE SLITS
2893-139322-0017 THE FACTORIES THAT WERE NOT WORKING WERE SPARSELY LIGHTED TO GRAHAM THEY AND THEIR SHROUDED AISLES OF GIANT MACHINES SEEMED PLUNGED IN GLOOM AND EVEN WHERE WORK WAS GOING ON THE ILLUMINATION WAS FAR LESS BRILLIANT THAN UPON THE PUBLIC WAYS
2893-139322-0018 HE CAME TO THE WARREN OF THE JEWELLERS AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND BY USING HIS SIGNATURE OBTAINED ADMISSION TO THESE GALLERIES THEY WERE HIGH AND DARK AND RATHER COLD IN THE FIRST A FEW MEN WERE MAKING ORNAMENTS OF GOLD FILIGREE
2893-139322-0019 EACH MAN AT A LITTLE BENCH BY HIMSELF AND WITH A LITTLE SHADED LIGHT THE LONG VISTA OF LIGHT PATCHES WITH THE NIMBLE FINGERS BRIGHTLY LIT AND MOVING AMONG THE GLEAMING YELLOW COILS AND THE INTENT FACE LIKE THE FACE OF A GHOST IN EACH SHADOW
2893-139322-0020 HAD THE ODDEST EFFECT THE WORK WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED
2893-139322-0021 FOR THE MOST PART INTRICATE GROTESQUES OR THE RINGING OF THE CHANGES ON A GEOMETRICAL MOTIF THESE WORKERS WORE A PECULIAR WHITE UNIFORM WITHOUT POCKETS OR SLEEVES THEY ASSUMED THIS ON COMING TO WORK BUT AT NIGHT
2893-139322-0022 IN SPITE OF EVERY PRECAUTION THE LABOUR POLICEMAN TOLD THEM IN A DEPRESSED TONE THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT INFREQUENTLY ROBBED BEYOND WAS A GALLERY OF WOMEN BUSIED IN CUTTING AND SETTING SLABS OF ARTIFICIAL RUBY
2893-139322-0023 MANY OF THESE WORKERS HAD LIPS AND NOSTRILS A LIVID WHITE DUE TO A DISEASE CAUSED BY A PECULIAR PURPLE ENAMEL THAT CHANCED TO BE MUCH IN FASHION ASANO APOLOGISED TO GRAHAM FOR THIS OFFENSIVE SIGHT BUT EXCUSED HIMSELF ON THE SCORE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS ROUTE
2893-139322-0024 THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE SAID GRAHAM THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE TRYING TO AVOID A START AT A PARTICULARLY STRIKING DISFIGUREMENT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH HERSELF THAN THAT SAID ASANO
2893-139322-0025 GRAHAM MADE SOME INDIGNANT COMMENTS BUT SIRE WE SIMPLY COULD NOT STAND THAT STUFF WITHOUT THE PURPLE SAID ASANO IN YOUR DAYS PEOPLE COULD STAND SUCH CRUDITIES THEY WERE NEARER THE BARBARIC BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS
2893-139322-0026 AND CAME TO A LITTLE BRIDGE THAT SPANNED A VAULT LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET GRAHAM SAW THAT BENEATH WAS A WHARF UNDER YET MORE TREMENDOUS ARCHINGS THAN ANY HE HAD SEEN THREE BARGES SMOTHERED IN FLOURY DUST WERE BEING UNLOADED OF THEIR CARGOES OF POWDERED FELSPAR
2893-139322-0027 BY A MULTITUDE OF COUGHING MEN EACH GUIDING A LITTLE TRUCK THE DUST FILLED THE PLACE WITH A CHOKING MIST AND TURNED THE ELECTRIC GLARE YELLOW THE VAGUE SHADOWS OF THESE WORKERS GESTICULATED ABOUT THEIR FEET AND RUSHED TO AND FRO AGAINST A LONG STRETCH OF WHITE WASHED WALL
2893-139322-0028 EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE WOULD STOP TO COUGH A SHADOWY HUGE MASS OF MASONRY RISING OUT OF THE INKY WATER BROUGHT TO GRAHAM'S MIND THE THOUGHT OF THE MULTITUDE OF WAYS AND GALLERIES AND LIFTS THAT ROSE FLOOR ABOVE FLOOR OVERHEAD BETWEEN HIM AND THE SKY
2893-139322-0029 THEIR FEET MADE A HOLLOW THUNDER ON THE PLANKS ALONG WHICH THEY WENT TO AND FRO AND AS HE LOOKED AT THIS SCENE SOME HIDDEN VOICE IN THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO SING STOP THAT SHOUTED ONE OF THE POLICEMEN BUT THE ORDER WAS DISOBEYED
2893-139322-0030 AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL THE WHITE STAINED MEN WHO WERE WORKING THERE HAD TAKEN UP THE BEATING REFRAIN SINGING IT DEFIANTLY THE SONG OF THE REVOLT THE FEET UPON THE PLANKS THUNDERED NOW TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
2893-139322-0031 THE POLICEMAN WHO HAD SHOUTED GLANCED AT HIS FELLOW AND GRAHAM SAW HIM SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS HE MADE NO FURTHER EFFORT TO STOP THE SINGING AND SO THEY WENT THROUGH THESE FACTORIES AND PLACES OF TOIL SEEING MANY PAINFUL AND GRIM THINGS
2893-139322-0032 THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
2893-139322-0033 THE ROAR AND RATTLE OF BELT AND ARMATURE OF ILL LIT SUBTERRANEAN AISLES OF SLEEPING PLACES ILLIMITABLE VISTAS OF PIN POINT LIGHTS HERE WAS THE SMELL OF TANNING AND HERE THE REEK OF A BREWERY
2893-139322-0034 AND HERE UNPRECEDENTED REEKS EVERYWHERE WERE PILLARS AND CROSS ARCHINGS OF SUCH A MASSIVENESS AS GRAHAM HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN THICK TITANS OF GREASY SHINING BRICKWORK CRUSHED BENEATH THE VAST WEIGHT OF THAT COMPLEX CITY WORLD
2893-139322-0035 EVEN AS THESE ANEMIC MILLIONS WERE CRUSHED BY ITS COMPLEXITY AND EVERYWHERE WERE PALE FEATURES LEAN LIMBS DISFIGUREMENT AND DEGRADATION ONCE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME
2893-139322-0036 GRAHAM HEARD THE SONG OF THE REVOLT DURING HIS LONG UNPLEASANT RESEARCH IN THESE PLACES AND ONCE HE SAW A CONFUSED STRUGGLE DOWN A PASSAGE AND LEARNT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE SERFS HAD SEIZED THEIR BREAD BEFORE THEIR WORK WAS DONE GRAHAM WAS ASCENDING TOWARDS THE WAYS AGAIN
2893-139322-0037 WHEN HE SAW A NUMBER OF BLUE CLAD CHILDREN RUNNING DOWN A TRANSVERSE PASSAGE AND PRESENTLY PERCEIVED THE REASON OF THEIR PANIC IN A COMPANY OF THE LABOUR POLICE ARMED WITH CLUBS TROTTING TOWARDS SOME UNKNOWN DISTURBANCE AND THEN CAME A REMOTE DISORDER
2893-139322-0038 BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS REMNANT THAT WORKED WORKED HOPELESSLY ALL THE SPIRIT THAT WAS LEFT IN FALLEN HUMANITY WAS ABOVE IN THE STREETS THAT NIGHT CALLING FOR THE MASTER AND VALIANTLY AND NOISILY KEEPING ITS ARMS
2893-139322-0039 THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES
2893-139322-0040 THEN A WOMAN WITH A FACE OF MUTE WHITE TERROR AND ANOTHER WHO GASPED AND SHRIEKED AS SHE RAN WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW SAID GRAHAM PUZZLED FOR HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR THICK SPEECH THEN HE HEARD IT IN ENGLISH AND PERCEIVED THAT THE THING THAT EVERYONE WAS SHOUTING
2893-139322-0041 THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
2893-139322-0042 HE HESITATED LOOKED AT GRAHAM'S FACE AND TOLD HIM THE THING HE ALREADY KNEW BUT HOW CAN THEY KNOW ASKED ASANO GRAHAM HEARD SOMEONE SHOUTING STOP ALL WORK STOP ALL WORK
2893-139322-0043 AND A SWARTHY HUNCHBACK RIDICULOUSLY GAY IN GREEN AND GOLD CAME LEAPING DOWN THE PLATFORMS TOWARD HIM BAWLING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN GOOD ENGLISH THIS IS OSTROG'S DOING OSTROG THE KNAVE THE MASTER IS BETRAYED HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE
2893-139322-0044 HE YELLED AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR THAT THE BLACK POLICE HAD DONE IN PARIS AND SO PASSED SHRIEKING OSTROG THE KNAVE FOR A MOMENT GRAHAM STOOD STILL FOR IT HAD COME UPON HIM AGAIN THAT THESE THINGS WERE A DREAM
2893-139322-0045 HE LOOKED UP AT THE GREAT CLIFF OF BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE VANISHING INTO BLUE HAZE AT LAST ABOVE THE LIGHTS AND DOWN TO THE ROARING TIERS OF PLATFORMS AND THE SHOUTING RUNNING PEOPLE WHO WERE GESTICULATING PAST
2893-139322-0046 THE MASTER IS BETRAYED THEY CRIED THE MASTER IS BETRAYED SUDDENLY THE SITUATION SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND REAL AND URGENT
2893-139322-0047 HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THE HOUR HAS COME HE THOUGHT SWIFTLY WHAT AM I TO DO GO BACK TO THE COUNCIL HOUSE SAID ASANO WHY SHOULD I NOT APPEAL THE PEOPLE ARE HERE
2893-139322-0048 YOU WILL LOSE TIME THEY WILL DOUBT IF IT IS YOU BUT THEY WILL MASS ABOUT THE COUNCIL HOUSE THERE YOU WILL FIND THEIR LEADERS YOUR STRENGTH IS THERE WITH THEM SUPPOSE THIS IS ONLY A RUMOUR
2893-139322-0049 IT SOUNDS TRUE SAID ASANO LET US HAVE THE FACTS SAID GRAHAM
2893-139322-0050 EVEN NOW THE RUINS MAY BE IMPASSABLE GRAHAM REGARDED HIM DOUBTFULLY AND FOLLOWED HIM THEY WENT UP THE STEPPED PLATFORMS TO THE SWIFTEST ONE AND THERE ASANO ACCOSTED A LABOURER THE ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS WERE IN THE THICK VULGAR SPEECH WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED GRAHAM
2893-139322-0051 HAD NOT SOMEONE IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES LEARNT HE SAID A GIRL A GIRL NOT HE SAID A GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS WHO CAME OUT FROM THE COUNCIL HOUSE CRYING ALOUD AND TOLD THE MEN AT WORK AMONG THE RUINS
2893-139322-0052 AND THEN ANOTHER THING WAS SHOUTED SOMETHING THAT TURNED AN AIMLESS TUMULT INTO DETERMINATE MOVEMENTS IT CAME LIKE A WIND ALONG THE STREET
5049-25947-0000 THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS ON THE DAY THE AMERICAN TROOPS LANDED ON THE COAST OF CUBA THE CUBANS INFORMED GENERAL WHEELER
5049-25947-0001 BLOCKING THE WAY TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0002 NOR EVEN A COLLECTION OF HOUSES IT IS THE MEETING PLACE OF TWO TRAILS WHICH JOIN AT THE APEX OF A V THREE MILES FROM THE SEAPORT TOWN OF SIBONEY AND CONTINUE MERGED IN A SINGLE TRAIL TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0003 GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0004 THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WOULD ATTACK THE SPANISH POSITION
5049-25947-0005 AND WHAT HE WAS TO DO WHEN HE FOUND HIM THAT NIGHT NO ONE SLEPT FOR UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TROOPS WERE STILL BEING DISEMBARKED IN THE SURF AND TWO SHIPS OF WAR HAD THEIR SEARCHLIGHTS TURNED ON THE LANDING PLACE
5049-25947-0006 LAY THE CAMP OF THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THROUGH IT CUBAN OFFICERS WERE RIDING THEIR HALF STARVED PONIES AND SCATTERING THE ASHES OF THE CAMP FIRES
5049-25947-0007 BELOW THEM WAS THE BEACH AND THE ROARING SURF IN WHICH A THOUSAND OR SO NAKED MEN WERE ASSISTING AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS SHOREWARD OF THEIR COMRADES IN PONTOONS AND SHORE BOATS
5049-25947-0008 WHICH WERE BEING HURLED AT THE BEACH LIKE SLEDS DOWN A WATER CHUTE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WEIRD AND REMARKABLE SCENES OF THE WAR PROBABLY OF ANY WAR
5049-25947-0009 OR SHOUTING WITH DELIGHT AS THEY PLUNGED INTO THE FIRST BATH THAT HAD OFFERED IN SEVEN DAYS AND THOSE IN THE LAUNCHES AS THEY WERE PITCHED HEAD FIRST AT THE SOIL OF CUBA SIGNALIZED THEIR ARRIVAL BY HOWLS OF TRIUMPH
5049-25947-0010 ON EITHER SIDE ROSE BLACK OVERHANGING RIDGES
5049-25947-0011 OF THE SEARCH LIGHTS SHAMING THE QUIET MOONLIGHT
5049-25947-0012 THE ROUGH RIDERS LEFT CAMP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HALF A DOZEN OFFICERS THEY WERE DISMOUNTED AND CARRIED THEIR BLANKET ROLLS HAVERSACKS AMMUNITION AND CARBINES
5049-25947-0013 ALONG THE TRAIL TO THE WEST WHICH WAS ON HIGH GROUND AND A HALF MILE TO A MILE DISTANT FROM THE TRAIL ALONG WHICH GENERAL YOUNG AND HIS REGULARS WERE MARCHING
5049-25947-0014 THERE WAS A VALLEY BETWEEN US AND THE BUSHES WERE SO THICK ON BOTH SIDES OF OUR TRAIL
5049-25947-0015 TO DISTINGUISH THE OTHER COLUMN AS SOON AS THE ROUGH RIDERS HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE NOT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THEY HAD LEFT CAMP WHICH WAS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF COLONEL WOOD ORDERED CAPTAIN CAPRON
5049-25947-0016 NO FLANKERS WERE PLACED FOR THE REASON THAT THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND THE TANGLE OF VINES THAT STRETCHED FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES TO THE BUSHES BELOW MADE IT A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
5049-25947-0017 A CUBAN OFFICER AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT THEY RODE SLOWLY IN CONSIDERATION OF THE TROOPERS ON FOOT WHO UNDER A CRUELLY HOT SUN CARRIED HEAVY BURDENS TO THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE TO WALK
5049-25947-0018 WE ADVANCED TALKING IN THAT FASHION AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AND CONGRATULATING OURSELVES IN BEING SHUT OF THE TRANSPORT AND ON BREATHING FINE MOUNTAIN AIR AGAIN
5049-25947-0019 WE HAD BEEN RIDING IN THIS PLEASANT FASHION FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH BRIEF HALTS FOR REST WHEN WOOD STOPPED THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN AND RODE DOWN THE TRAIL TO MEET CAPRON WHO WAS COMING BACK
5049-25947-0020 THERE WAS ON ONE SIDE OF IT A STOUT BARBED WIRE FENCE OF FIVE STRANDS BY SOME FORTUNATE ACCIDENT THIS FENCE HAD BEEN CUT JUST WHERE THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN HALTED ON THE LEFT OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0021 IT SHUT OFF FIELDS OF HIGH GRASS BLOCKED AT EVERY FIFTY YARDS WITH GREAT BARRICADES OF UNDERGROWTH AND TANGLED TREES AND CHAPPARAL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0022 THERE WAS NOT A FOOT OF FREE GROUND THE BUSHES SEEMED ABSOLUTELY IMPENETRABLE AS INDEED THEY WERE LATER FOUND TO BE WHEN WE HALTED THE MEN SAT
5049-25947-0023 OR FANNED THE AIR WITH THEIR HATS THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION SUCH AS THEIR LEADERS POSSESSED AND THEIR ONLY EMOTION WAS ONE OF SATISFACTION AT THE CHANCE THE HALT GAVE THEM
5049-25947-0024 AT THE READY PEERING INTO THE BUSHES WE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE WHILE WOOD RECONNOITRED FOR OVER TEN MINUTES THEN HE RETURNED AND BEGAN DEPLOYING HIS TROOPS OUT AT EITHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0025 G TROOP WAS ORDERED TO BEAT INTO THE BUSHES ON THE RIGHT AND K AND A WERE SENT OVER THE RIDGE ON WHICH WE STOOD DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW TO CONNECT WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0026 F AND E TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN SKIRMISH LINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE FENCE WOOD HAD DISCOVERED THE ENEMY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIM AND SO FAR FROM BEING SURPRISED HE HAD TIME
5049-25947-0027 ACTING ON A FALSE ALARM AND THAT THERE WERE NO SPANIARDS AHEAD OF US I GUESSED IT WAS CAPRON'S MEN FIRING AT RANDOM TO DISCLOSE THE ENEMY'S POSITION I RAN AFTER G TROOP UNDER CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND FOUND
5049-25947-0028 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE THICKET AT ONE MOMENT THE UNDERBRUSH SEEMED SWARMING WITH OUR MEN AND THE NEXT EXCEPT THAT YOU HEARD THE TWIGS BREAKING AND HEAVY BREATHING OR A CRASH AS A VINE PULLED SOME ONE DOWN
5049-25947-0029 THROUGH THE TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING THAT FOLLOWED ALTHOUGH MEN WERE FALLING ALL AROUND US THE SPANIARDS ON THE RIDGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT MANY OF US SAW BUT THE FIRE AGAINST US WAS NOT MORE THAN EIGHTY YARDS AWAY
5049-25947-0030 AND SO HOT THAT OUR MEN COULD ONLY LIE FLAT IN THE GRASS AND RETURN IT IN THAT POSITION IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT OUR MEN BELIEVED THEY WERE BEING
5049-25947-0031 WHICH THEY IMAGINED MUST HAVE SWUNG TO THE RIGHT AND HAVING LOST ITS BEARINGS AND HEARING THEM ADVANCING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH HAD MISTAKEN THEM FOR THE ENEMY THEY ACCORDINGLY CEASED FIRING AND BEGAN SHOUTING
5049-25947-0032 LATER WE EXAMINED THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE TRAIL WHICH CAPRON HELD AND THE POSITION OF G TROOP AND THEY WERE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO ONE ANOTHER
5049-25947-0033 CAPRON COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE FIRED INTO US AT ANY TIME UNLESS HE HAD TURNED DIRECTLY AROUND IN HIS TRACKS AND AIMED UP THE VERY TRAIL HE HAD JUST DESCENDED
5049-25947-0034 THEY COULD NOT SEE TWENTY FEET ON THREE SIDES OF THEM BUT ON THE RIGHT HAND LAY THE VALLEY AND ACROSS IT CAME THE SOUND OF YOUNG'S BRIGADE WHO WERE APPARENTLY HEAVILY ENGAGED
5049-25947-0035 THE ENEMY'S FIRE WAS SO CLOSE THAT THE MEN COULD NOT HEAR THE WORD OF COMMAND AND CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND LIEUTENANT GREENWAY UNABLE TO GET THEIR ATTENTION RAN AMONG THEM
5049-25947-0036 LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
5049-25947-0037 KANE WAS SMILING WITH THE CHARMING CONTENT OF A PERFECTLY HAPPY MAN WHEN CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN TOLD HIM HIS MEN WERE NOT NEEDED AND TO REJOIN HIS TROOP HE LED HIS DETAIL OVER THE EDGE OF THE HILL ON WHICH WE LAY
5049-25947-0038 BUT WALKED ERECT STILL SMILING ROOSEVELT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVANCE FARTHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE NETWORK OF WILD GRAPE VINES THAT MASKED THE SPANIARDS FROM US AND THAT WE MUST CROSS THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0039 DRAGGING THE WOUNDED WITH US OWING TO THE LOW AIM OF THE ENEMY WE WERE FORCED TO MOVE ON OUR KNEES AND CRAWL EVEN THEN MEN WERE HIT ONE MAN NEAR ME WAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
5049-25947-0040 IT HAD BEEN ORDERED TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN AND WHILE ADVANCING AND FIRING ON THE RIDGE CAPTAIN JENKINS SENT
5049-25947-0041 BEARER BACK TO CLIMB THE HILL AND WAVE HIS RED AND WHITE BANNER WHERE YOUNG'S MEN COULD SEE IT
5049-25947-0042 BUT HE CONTINUED WAVING IT UNTIL THE TENTH CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ANSWERED AND THE TWO COLUMNS WERE CONNECTED BY A SKIRMISH LINE COMPOSED OF K TROOP AND A UNDER CAPTAIN BUCKY O'NEILL
5049-25947-0043 G TROOP MEANWHILE HAD HURRIED OVER TO THE LEFT AND PASSING THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE WIRE FENCE HAD SPREAD OUT INTO OPEN ORDER IT FOLLOWED DOWN AFTER CAPTAIN LUNA'S TROOP AND D AND E TROOPS
5049-25947-0044 WHICH WERE WELL ALREADY IN ADVANCE
5049-25947-0045 WOOD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONG IT LEADING HIS HORSE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF USE IN CASE HE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTER HIS ORIGINAL FORMATION
5049-25947-0046 HIS PLAN AT PRESENT WAS TO SPREAD OUT HIS MEN SO THAT THEY WOULD JOIN YOUNG ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT SWING AROUND UNTIL THEY FLANKED THE ENEMY K AND A TROOPS
5049-25947-0047 IT WAS ONLY BY THE FIRING THAT HE COULD TELL WHERE HIS MEN LAY AND THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS ADVANCING THE ADVANCES WERE MADE IN QUICK DESPERATE RUSHES SOMETIMES THE GROUND GAINED
5049-25947-0048 WAS NO MORE THAN A MAN COVERS IN SLIDING FOR A BASE AT OTHER TIMES HALF A TROOP WOULD RISE AND RACE FORWARD AND THEN BURROW DEEP IN THE HOT GRASS AND FIRE
5049-25947-0049 THE FIRE DISCIPLINE WAS EXCELLENT THE PROPHETS OF EVIL OF THE TAMPA BAY HOTEL HAD FORETOLD THAT THE COWBOYS WOULD SHOOT AS THEY CHOSE AND IN THE FIELD WOULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR OFFICERS
5049-25947-0050 HANDICAPPED THEIR STRENGTH CRUELLY THE ENEMY WAS HIDDEN IN THE SHADE OF THE JUNGLE WHILE THEY FOR EVERY THICKET THEY GAINED
5049-25947-0051 WHICH WAS AS HOT AS A STEAM BATH AND WITH THEIR FLESH AND CLOTHING TORN BY THORNS AND THE SWORD LIKE BLADE OF THE SPANISH BAYONET THE GLARE OF THE SUN WAS FULL IN THEIR EYES AND AS FIERCE AS A LIME LIGHT
5049-25947-0052 IT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A DRESSING STATION AND THE WOUNDED OF G TROOP WERE LEFT THERE IN THE CARE OF THE HOSPITAL STEWARDS A TALL GAUNT YOUNG MAN WITH A CROSS ON HIS ARM WAS JUST COMING BACK UP THE TRAIL HIS HEAD WAS BENT
5049-25947-0053 I KNEW IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AND YET HE WAS CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TIME OF EXCITEMENT AND RUSH AND HEAT THEN I REMEMBERED HIM AS NOW HE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BLOOD AND DIRT AND PERSPIRATION
5049-25947-0054 BUT THEN HE WORE A CANVAS JACKET AND THE MAN HE CARRIED ON HIS SHOULDERS WAS TRYING TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM A WHITE WASHED LINE AND I RECOGNIZED THE YOUNG DOCTOR WITH THE BLOOD BATHING HIS BREECHES AS BOB CHURCH
5049-25947-0055 AND THAT SO FEW OF THEM DIED IS GREATLY DUE TO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO WENT DOWN INTO THE FIRING LINE AND PULLED THEM FROM IT AND BORE THEM OUT OF DANGER
5049-25947-0056 AND THE COLLEGE SWELLS OF THE ROUGH RIDERS
5049-25947-0057 THE WALK DOWN THAT TRAIL PRESENTED ONE OF THE MOST GREWSOME PICTURES OF THE WAR
5049-25947-0058 HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH IT LOOKED AS THOUGH A RETREATING ARMY HAD FLED ALONG IT RATHER THAN THAT ONE TROOP HAD FOUGHT ITS WAY THROUGH IT TO THE FRONT
5049-25947-0059 FOR THE WOUNDED LYING ALONG ITS LENGTH WERE AS STILL AS THE DEAD BESIDE THEM THE NOISE OF THE LOOSE STONES ROLLING UNDER MY FEET BROUGHT A HOSPITAL STEWARD OUT OF THE BRUSH AND HE CALLED AFTER ME
5049-25947-0060 LIEUTENANT THOMAS IS BADLY WOUNDED IN HERE AND WE CAN'T MOVE HIM
5049-25947-0061 SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
5049-25947-0062 LARGE AND POWERFULLY BUILT HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE LEG JUST BELOW THE TRUNK AND I FOUND HIM LYING ON A BLANKET HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH BLOOD AND WITH HIS LEG BOUND IN TOURNIQUETS MADE OF TWIGS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
5049-25947-0063 IT GAVE ONE A THRILL OF AWE AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THESE COWBOY SURGEONS WITH A STICK THAT ONE WOULD USE TO LIGHT A PIPE AND WITH THE GAUDY KERCHIEFS THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THEIR NECKS
5049-25947-0064 YOU'RE TAKING ME TO THE FRONT AREN'T YOU YOU SAID YOU WOULD THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEY'VE KILLED CAPTAIN CAPRON THE MEXICANS THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN
5049-25947-0065 BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WE STUMBLED OVER THE STONES AND VINES BUMPING HIS WOUNDED BODY AGAINST THE GROUND AND LEAVING A BLACK STREAK IN THE GRASS BEHIND US BUT IT SEEMED TO HURT US MORE THAN IT DID HIM
5049-25947-0066 GRAVE BOYISH FACES FILLED WITH SYMPATHY AND CONCERN ONLY FIFTY FEET FROM HIM AND FARTHER DOWN THE TRAIL I PASSED HIS CAPTAIN WITH HIS BODY PROPPED AGAINST CHURCH'S KNEE
5049-25947-0067 AND WITH HIS HEAD FALLEN ON THE SURGEON'S SHOULDER CAPRON WAS ALWAYS A HANDSOME SOLDIERLY LOOKING MAN
5049-25947-0068 AND AS I SAW HIM THEN DEATH HAD GIVEN HIM A GREAT DIGNITY AND NOBLENESS HE WAS ONLY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD THE AGE WHEN LIFE HAS JUST BEGUN
5049-25947-0069 WITH IT AND THAT THOUGH THEY MIGHT PECK AND MEND AT THE BODY HE HAD RECEIVED HIS FINAL ORDERS
5049-25947-0070 STRANGELY MEAN AND TAWDRY
5049-25947-0071 A BOY WAS LYING WITH A BULLET WOUND BETWEEN HIS EYES HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING WITH SHORT HOARSE NOISES WHICH I GUESSED WERE DUE TO SOME MUSCULAR ACTION ENTIRELY AND THAT HE WAS VIRTUALLY DEAD
5049-25947-0072 SCRIBBLED IN IT IN PENCIL
5049-25947-0073 WE ONLY MET TWO WEEKS AGO AT SAN ANTONIO BUT HE AND ME HAD GOT TO BE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO NOW
5049-25947-0074 WAS WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE FARTHEST POINT
5049-25947-0075 AND I WAS RUNNING FORWARD FEELING CONFIDENT THAT I MUST BE CLOSE ON OUR MEN WHEN I SAW THE BODY OF A SERGEANT BLOCKING THE TRAIL AND STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ACROSS IT
5049-25947-0076 IT WAS APPARENTLY THE BODY OF THE FIRST MAN KILLED AFTER DEATH THE BODIES OF SOME MEN SEEM TO SHRINK ALMOST INSTANTLY WITHIN THEMSELVES THEY BECOME LIMP AND SHAPELESS
5049-25947-0077 WITH HIS REGIMENT BEHIND HIM AND FACING THE ENEMIES OF HIS COUNTRY THE LINE AT THIS TIME WAS DIVIDED BY THE TRAIL INTO TWO WINGS THE RIGHT WING COMPOSED OF K AND A TROOPS WAS ADVANCING THROUGH THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0078 I BORROWED A CARBINE FROM A WOUNDED MAN AND JOINED THE REMNANT OF L TROOP WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE TRAIL THIS TROOP WAS THEN COMMANDED BY SECOND LIEUTENANT DAY WHO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT THAT MORNING
5049-25947-0079 AND AT THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN LATER WHEN HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE ARM WAS PROMOTED TO BE CAPTAIN OF L TROOP OR AS IT WAS LATER OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED CAPRON'S TROOP HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE LINE AS UNCONCERNEDLY
5049-25947-0080 AS THOUGH WE WERE AT TARGET PRACTICE AND AN IRISH SERGEANT BYRNE WAS ASSISTING HIM BY KEEPING UP A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS THAT SHOWED THE KEENEST ENJOYMENT OF THE SITUATION
5049-25947-0081 BYRNE WAS THE ONLY MAN I NOTICED WHO SEEMED TO REGARD THE FIGHT AS IN ANY WAY HUMOROUS
5049-25947-0082 THE CONDITIONS WERE EXCEPTIONAL
5049-25947-0083 AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN UNDER FIRE NOR HAD ONE MAN IN THE REGIMENT EVER FIRED A KRAG JORGENSEN CARBINE UNTIL HE FIRED IT AT A SPANIARD
5049-25947-0084 FOR THEIR ARMS HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THEM SO SOON BEFORE SAILING THAT THEY HAD ONLY DRILLED WITH THEM WITHOUT USING CARTRIDGES TO THIS HANDICAP WAS ALSO ADDED THE NATURE OF THE GROUND
5049-25947-0085 AND THE FACT THAT OUR MEN COULD NOT SEE THEIR OPPONENTS THEIR OWN MEN FELL OR ROLLED OVER ON EVERY SIDE SHOT DOWN BY AN INVISIBLE ENEMY WITH NO ONE UPON WHOM THEY COULD RETALIATE
5049-25947-0086 WITH NO SIGN THAT THE ATTACK MIGHT NOT GO ON INDEFINITELY YET THEY NEVER ONCE TOOK A STEP BACKWARD BUT ADVANCED GRIMLY CLEANING A BUSH OR THICKET OF ITS OCCUPANTS BEFORE CHARGING IT
5049-25947-0087 AND SECURING ITS COVER FOR THEMSELVES AND ANSWERING EACH VOLLEY WITH ONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE AN ECHO OF THE FIRST THE MEN WERE PANTING FOR BREATH THE SWEAT RAN SO READILY INTO THEIR EYES THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE SIGHTS OF THEIR GUNS
5049-25947-0088 THEIR LIMBS UNUSED TO SUCH EXERTION AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF CRAMPED IDLENESS ON THE TROOP SHIP TREMBLED WITH WEAKNESS AND THE SUN BLINDED
5049-25947-0089 BUT TIME AFTER TIME THEY ROSE AND STAGGERED FORWARD THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS
5049-25947-0090 AND PASSING THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF CONVULSIONS HE NEVERTHELESS IN HIS BRIEF MOMENTS OF COMPARATIVE PEACE BORE HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST CALM
5049-25947-0091 A SOLDIER TO DUTY THAT HE CONTINUED WRITING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE FIGHT
5049-25947-0092 AS AN EXCUSE TO GO TO LEAVE THE FIRING LINE I HAVE WATCHED OTHER FIGHTS WHERE THE MEN ENGAGED WERE QUITE WILLING TO UNSELFISHLY BEAR THE WOUNDED FROM THE ZONE OF DANGER
5049-25947-0093 FOR AGUARDIENTE AND WAS NOW OCCUPIED IN FORCE BY THE ENEMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE FAR LEFT WAS MOVING UP HIS MEN WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THIS HOUSE ON THE FLANK
5049-25947-0094 WOOD WHO WAS ALL OVER THE LINE HAD THE SAME OBJECTIVE POINT IN HIS MIND THE TROOP COMMANDERS HAD A GENERAL IDEA THAT THE DISTILLERY WAS THE KEY TO THE ENEMY'S POSITION AND WERE ALL WORKING IN THAT DIRECTION
5049-25947-0095 IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR WOOD AND ROOSEVELT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CAPTAINS AND AFTER THE FIRST GENERAL ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM THEY RELIED UPON THE LATTER'S INTELLIGENCE TO PULL THEM THROUGH
5049-25947-0096 I DO NOT SUPPOSE WOOD OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED ENGAGED SAW MORE THAN THIRTY OF HIS MEN
5049-25947-0097 SO EXCELLENT WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE OFFICERS AND SO READY THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN THAT THEY KEPT AN ALMOST PERFECT ALIGNMENT AS WAS SHOWN WHEN THE FINAL ORDER CAME TO CHARGE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
5049-25947-0098 SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE TWICE DAY'S AGE BEGGED HIM TO LET THEM TAKE THE ENEMY'S IMPROMPTU FORT ON THE RUN BUT HE ANSWERED THEM TOLERANTLY LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN AND HELD THEM DOWN UNTIL THERE WAS A LULL IN THE ENEMY'S FIRE
5049-25947-0099 AND RAN FOR THE COVER THEY WERE DIRECTED TO TAKE LIKE MEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN AND FELL PANTING ON THEIR FACES WHILE THE WESTERN TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS SLIPPED AND WRIGGLED THROUGH THE GRASS LIKE INDIANS
5049-25947-0100 DODGING FROM TREE TRUNK TO TREE TRUNK AND FROM ONE BUSH TO ANOTHER THEY FELL INTO LINE AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE OTHERS BUT WHILE DOING SO THEY HAD NOT ONCE EXPOSED THEMSELVES
5049-25947-0101 SOME OF THE ESCAPES WERE LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS THE MAN ON MY RIGHT CHAMPNEYS MARSHALL OF WASHINGTON HAD ONE BULLET PASS THROUGH HIS SLEEVE AND ANOTHER PASS THROUGH HIS SHIRT WHERE IT WAS PULLED CLOSE TO HIS SPINE
5049-25947-0102 AND ROOSEVELT WAS SO CLOSE TO ONE BULLET WHEN IT STRUCK A TREE THAT IT FILLED HIS EYES AND EARS WITH TINY SPLINTERS MAJOR BRODIE AND LIEUTENANT THOMAS WERE BOTH WOUNDED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0103 AT SIBONEY ROWLAND SAT STILL FOR A SHORT TIME
5049-25947-0104 WITH THE REST OF THE WOUNDED BUT TWO DAYS LATER HE APPEARED IN CAMP
5049-25947-0105 A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES AND UPHILL ALL THE WAY CARRYING HIS CARBINE CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL WOOD SAID I WAS ROWLAND ANSWERED SHEEPISHLY
5049-25947-0106 WHEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY ASKED TO BE PROPPED UP AGAINST A TREE WITH HIS CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT BESIDE HIM AND THE LAST HIS TROOP SAW OF HIM HE WAS SEATED ALONE GRIMLY FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS
5049-25947-0107 IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ENEMY EARLY IN THE FIGHT I CAME UPON CHURCH ATTENDING TO A YOUNG COWBOY WHO WAS SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST
5049-25947-0108 THE ENTRANCE TO HIS WOUND WAS SO SMALL THAT CHURCH COULD NOT INSERT ENOUGH OF THE GAUZE PACKING TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS HOLE LARGER HE SAID TO THE BOY OR YOU'LL BLEED TO DEATH
5049-25947-0109 CAN YOU STAND BEING CARRIED DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CARRY ME THE TROOPER ASKED YES WELL EXCLAIMED THE BOY ADMIRINGLY YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
5049-25947-0110 GAVE HIM HIS CHOICE OF RIDING DOWN TO SIBONEY
5049-25947-0111 OR OF BEING CARRIED A DAY LATER ON A LITTER
5049-25947-0112 YOU CAN START AT ONCE BUT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN SPARE THE MEN YOU CAN BE CARRIED ALL THE WAY
5049-25947-0113 AND INTO A HUGE MEXICAN SADDLE HE STUCK HIS WOUNDED ANKLE INTO ONE STIRRUP AND HIS UNTOUCHED ONE INTO THE OTHER AND GATHERED UP THE REINS DOES IT PAIN YOU CAN YOU STAND IT
5049-25947-0114 THE FIRING FROM THE ENEMY SOUNDED LESS NEAR AND THE BULLETS PASSED MUCH HIGHER ROOSEVELT WHO HAD PICKED UP A CARBINE AND WAS FIRING TO GIVE THE DIRECTION TO THE OTHERS DETERMINED UPON A CHARGE
5049-25947-0115 WOOD AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE DECIDED AT THE SAME TIME UPON THE SAME MANOEUVRE IT WAS CALLED WOOD'S BLUFF AFTERWARD FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO BACK IT WITH
5049-25947-0116 WHILE TO THE ENEMY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HIS WHOLE FORCE WAS BUT THE SKIRMISH LINE IN ADVANCE OF A REGIMENT THE SPANIARDS NATURALLY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THIN LINE WHICH SUDDENLY BROKE OUT OF THE BUSHES
5049-25947-0117 AND FROM BEHIND TREES AND CAME CHEERING OUT INTO THE HOT SUNLIGHT WAS THE ENTIRE FIGHTING FORCE AGAINST IT THEY SUPPOSED THE REGIMENT WAS COMING CLOSE ON ITS HEELS
5049-25947-0118 AND AS SPANISH TROOPS HATE BEING RUSHED AS A CAT HATES WATER THEY FIRED A FEW PARTING VOLLEYS AND BROKE AND RAN THE CHEERING HAD THE SAME INVIGORATING EFFECT ON OUR OWN SIDE AS A COLD SHOWER
5049-25947-0119 IT WAS WHAT FIRST TOLD HALF THE MEN WHERE THE OTHER HALF WERE AND IT MADE EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAN FEEL BETTER AS WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY A BLUFF THE FIRST CHEER WAS WAVERING
5049-25947-0120 WHEN WE FIRED A VOLLEY ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID LATER INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK THEY CAME FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT TO COME CLOSER AT EVERY VOLLEY
5049-25947-0121 WHERE HE ANNOUNCED HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ARMY ONE OF THE RESIDENTS OF SANTIAGO ASKED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IF THOSE AMERICANS FOUGHT WELL WELL HE REPLIED
5049-25947-0122 STORMING A RIDGE EQUALLY WORTHY OF PRAISE BUT IT HAS SEEMED BETTER NOT TO TRY AND TELL OF ANYTHING I DID NOT SEE BUT TO LIMIT MYSELF TO THE WORK OF THE ROUGH RIDERS TO WHOM AFTER ALL THE VICTORY WAS DUE
5049-25947-0123 AS IT WAS OWING TO COLONEL WOOD'S CHARGE WHICH TOOK THE SPANIARDS IN FLANK THAT GENERAL WHEELER AND GENERAL YOUNG WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE
5049-25947-0124 OVER FOUR TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER INTRENCHED BEHIND RIFLE PITS AND BUSHES IN A MOUNTAIN PASS IN SPITE OF THE SMOKELESS POWDER USED BY THE SPANIARDS
5049-25947-0125 THE ROUGH RIDERS ROUTED THEM OUT OF IT AND DROVE THEM BACK FROM THREE DIFFERENT BARRICADES UNTIL THEY MADE THEIR LAST STAND IN THE RUINED DISTILLERY WHENCE THEY FINALLY DROVE THEM BY ASSAULT
5049-25947-0126 THE EAGER SPIRIT IN WHICH THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IS BEST DESCRIBED IN THE SPANISH SOLDIER'S ANSWER TO THE INQUIRING CIVILIAN THEY TRIED TO CATCH US WITH THEIR HANDS
6078-54013-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A SERVANT WHO SERVED A WISE MAN
6078-54013-0001 DAY AFTER DAY TIME IN AND TIME OUT FOR SEVEN YEARS IN THOSE YEARS THE SERVANT WAS WELL ENOUGH CONTENTED BUT NO ONE LIKES TO ABIDE IN THE SAME PLACE FOREVER AND SO ONE DAY HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
6078-54013-0002 TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A FORTUNE A MAN MIGHT MAKE THERE FOR HIMSELF
6078-54013-0003 YOU HAVE SERVED ME FAITHFULLY THESE SEVEN YEARS GONE AND NOW THAT YOU ASK LEAVE TO GO YOU SHALL GO BUT IT IS LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MONEY THAT I CAN GIVE YOU AND SO YOU WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH WHAT I CAN AFFORD
6078-54013-0004 SEE HERE IS A LITTLE PEBBLE AND ITS LIKE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS FOR WHOEVER HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH CAN HEAR WHILE HE DOES SO
6078-54013-0005 PAYING HIS WAY WITH THE FEW PENNIES HE HAD SAVED IN HIS SEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE BUT FOR ALL OF HIS TRAVELLING NOTHING OF GOOD HAPPENED TO HIM UNTIL ONE MORNING HE CAME TO A LONELY PLACE WHERE THERE STOOD A GALLOWS AND THERE HE SAT HIM DOWN TO REST
6078-54013-0006 AND IT IS JUST IN SUCH AN UNLIKELY PLACE AS THIS THAT A MAN'S BEST CHANCE OF FORTUNE COMES TO HIM SOMETIMES AS THE SERVANT SAT THERE THERE CAME TWO RAVENS FLYING AND LIT UPON THE CROSS BEAM OVERHEAD
6078-54013-0007 THERE THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SERVANT POPPED THE PEBBLE INTO HIS MOUTH TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY YONDER IS A TRAVELLER IN THE WORLD SAID THE FIRST RAVEN YES SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0008 WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0009 AND THERE HE WOULD FIND A MAN SITTING
6078-54013-0010 THAT MAN WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE GARDEN
6078-54013-0011 THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS SAID THE FIRST RAVEN AND OF WHAT USE WOULD THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS BE TO HIM
6078-54013-0012 AND WISH AND WHATEVER ONE ASKS FOR ONE SHALL HAVE YOU MAY GUESS THAT WHEN THE SERVANT UNDERSTOOD THE TALK OF THE RAVENS HE WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING USE OF WHAT HE HEARD UP HE SCRAMBLED
6078-54013-0013 AND AWAY HE WENT AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM ON AND ON HE TRAVELLED UNTIL HE CAME TO THE CROSS ROADS AND THE STONE CROSS OF WHICH THE RAVEN SPOKE AND THERE SURE ENOUGH SAT THE TRAVELLER
6078-54013-0014 THERE IS ONE CONDITION YOU MUST FULFIL MANY STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN UPON OUR JOURNEY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
6078-54013-0015 AND SAY NOT A WORD DO YOU AGREE TO THAT YES SAID THE SERVANT I DO VERY WELL SAID HIS NEW COMRADE THEN LET US BE JOGGING
6078-54013-0016 AND THE TIME IS NONE TOO LONG TO GET THERE SO ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD TOGETHER UNTIL TOWARDS EVENING THEY CAME TO A TOWN WITH HIGH TOWERS AND STEEP ROOFS AND TALL SPIRES
6078-54013-0017 THE SERVANT'S COMPANION ENTERED THE GATE AS THOUGH HE KNEW THE PLACE RIGHT WELL AND LED THE WAY UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A NOBLE HOUSE THAT STOOD A LITTLE APART BY ITSELF WITH GARDENS OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES ALL AROUND IT
6078-54013-0018 THERE THE TRAVELLING COMPANION STOPPED AND DRAWING OUT A LITTLE PIPE FROM UNDER HIS JACKET
6078-54013-0019 TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC WELL HE PLAYED AND PLAYED UNTIL BY AND BY THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT CAME A SERVING MAN HO PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0020 WHERE DOZENS OF SERVANTS WERE SERVING A FINE FEAST BUT ONLY ONE MAN SAT AT TABLE A YOUNG MAN WITH A FACE SO SORROWFUL THAT IT MADE A BODY'S HEART ACHE TO LOOK UPON HIM CAN YOU PLAY GOOD MUSIC PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0021 BUT SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG HIS WIFE AND HE FELL OUT AND QUARRELLED UNTIL THERE WAS NO LIVING TOGETHER AND SHE HAD TO GO BACK TO HER OLD HOME THEN HIS COMPANIONS DESERTED HIM AND NOW HE LIVED ALL ALONE YOURS IS A HARD CASE SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0022 THEREUPON HE DREW OUT HIS PIPES AND BEGAN TO PLAY AND IT WAS SUCH A TUNE AS NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE HE PLAYED AND HE PLAYED AND AFTER A WHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIM BEGAN TO GET DROWSY FIRST THEY WINKED
6078-54013-0023 THEN THEY SHUT THEIR EYES AND THEN THEY NODDED UNTIL ALL WERE AS DUMB AS LOGS AND AS SOUND ASLEEP AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER WAKEN AGAIN ONLY THE SERVANT AND THE PIPER STAYED AWAKE FOR THE MUSIC DID NOT MAKE THEM DROWSY AS IT DID THE REST
6078-54013-0024 THEN WHEN ALL BUT THEY TWO WERE TIGHT AND FAST ASLEEP
6078-54013-0025 AND STEPPING UP TO THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM OFF HIS FINGER A SPLENDID RUBY RING AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BRIGHT AS FIRE AND POPPED THE SAME INTO HIS POCKET AND ALL THE WHILE THE SERVING MAN STOOD GAPING LIKE A FISH
6078-54013-0026 TO SEE WHAT HIS COMRADE WAS ABOUT
6078-54013-0027 NONE WAS MORE UGLY THAN THIS TO BEWITCH THE POOR SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN INTO A SLEEP AND THEN TO ROB HIM OF HIS RUBY RING
6078-54013-0028 BUT THE NEXT DAY THEY JOGGED ON TOGETHER AGAIN UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A GREAT FOREST THERE THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN TILL NIGHT CAME UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM STILL STUMBLING ONWARD THROUGH THE DARKNESS
6078-54013-0029 HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
6078-54013-0030 UP STEPPED THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR RAP TAP TAP BY AND BY IT WAS OPENED A CRACK AND THERE STOOD AN UGLY OLD WOMAN BLEAR EYED AND CROOKED AND GNARLED AS A WINTER TWIG
6078-54013-0031 NO MATTER FOR THAT SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WE CAN GO NO FARTHER TO NIGHT SO YOU MUST LET US IN AND HIDE US AS BEST YOU MAY AND IN HE WENT AS HE SAID WITH THE SERVANT AT HIS HEELS
6078-54013-0032 TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN GAVE THEM SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO EAT AND THEN HID THEM AWAY IN THE GREAT EMPTY MEAL CHEST IN THE CORNER AND THERE THEY LAY AS STILL AS MICE
6078-54013-0033 BY AND BY IN CAME THE GANG OF THIEVES WITH A GREAT NOISE AND UPROAR AND DOWN THEY SAT TO THEIR SUPPER
6078-54013-0034 HOW THEY HAD CRUELLY ROBBED AND MURDERED POOR PEOPLE
6078-54013-0035 HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE RUBY RING WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN'S FINGER
6078-54013-0036 THEN HE LED THE WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IF THE SERVING MAN HAD WONDERED THE DAY BEFORE AT THAT WHICH THE COMRADE DID HE WONDERED TEN TIMES MORE TO SEE HIM GIVE SO BEAUTIFUL A RING
6078-54013-0037 THE TWO TRAVELLERS CAME TO A LITTLE HUT NEAT ENOUGH
6078-54013-0038 AND THERE THE COMRADE KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR AND ASKED FOR LODGING
6078-54013-0039 NEVERTHELESS THEY MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM THE VERY BEST THAT WAS TO BE HAD IN THE HOUSE AND AFTER BOTH HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THEY SHOWED THEM TO BED IN A CORNER AS CLEAN AS SNOW AND THERE THEY SLEPT THE NIGHT THROUGH
6078-54013-0040 BUT THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE DAWNING OF THE DAY THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WAS STIRRING AGAIN
6078-54013-0041 FOR I HAVE A BIT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE AND STRANGE WORK IT WAS
6078-54013-0042 HE GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND STICKS OF WOOD AND STUFFED ALL UNDER THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE THEN HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND SET FIRE TO IT
6078-54013-0043 ALL WAS A RED BLAZE BEHIND THEM
6078-54013-0044 ON THEY JOGGED AND BY THE TIME EVENING WAS AT HAND THEY HAD COME TO A NEAT COTTAGE
6078-54013-0045 IN THIS COTTAGE LIVED A WIDOW AND HER ONLY SON AND THEY ALSO MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM A GOOD SUPPER AND SHOWED THEM TO A CLEAN BED THIS TIME THE TRAVELLING COMRADE DID NEITHER GOOD NOR ILL TO THOSE OF THE HOUSE
6078-54013-0046 BUT IN THE MORNING HE TOLD THE WIDOW WHITHER THEY WERE GOING AND ASKED IF SHE AND HER SON KNEW THE WAY TO THE GARDEN WHERE GREW THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS YES SAID SHE THAT WE DO FOR THE GARDEN IS NOT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM HERE
6078-54013-0047 AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
6078-54013-0048 AND OFF WENT THE THREE UP HILL AND DOWN DALE UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME OVER THE TOP OF THE LAST HILL AND THERE BELOW THEM LAY THE GARDEN AND WHAT A SIGHT IT WAS THE LEAVES SHINING AND GLISTENING LIKE SO MANY JEWELS IN THE SUNLIGHT
6078-54013-0049 ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND AND LOOK
6078-54013-0050 TORRENT WITHOUT A BRIDGE FOR A BODY TO CROSS OVER YONDER IS WHAT YOU SEEK SAID THE YOUNG MAN POINTING WITH HIS FINGER AND THERE YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS
6078-54013-0051 BUT SUDDENLY CATCHING THE WIDOW'S SON BY THE COLLAR HE LIFTED HIM AND FLUNG HIM INTO THE BLACK RUSHING WATER SPLASH WENT THE YOUNG MAN AND THEN AWAY HE WENT WHIRLING OVER ROCKS AND WATER FALLS THERE CRIED THE COMRADE
6078-54013-0052 THAT IS YOUR REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE
6078-54013-0053 HE FOUND HIS TONGUE AT LAST AND ALL THAT HE HAD BOTTLED UP
6078-54013-0054 SUCH ABUSE AS HE SHOWERED UPON HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE BUT TO ALL THE SERVANT SAID THE OTHER ANSWERED NEVER A WORD UNTIL HE HAD STOPPED FOR SHEER WANT OF BREATH THEN POOR FOOL SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0055 THEREUPON AS HE ENDED SPEAKING HE STRUCK HIS STAFF UPON THE GROUND INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE SKY DARKENED OVERHEAD UNTIL IT GREW AS BLACK AS NIGHT
6078-54013-0056 THE GARDEN AND THE TORRENT AND ALL WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT A NAKED PLAIN COVERED OVER WITH THE BONES OF THOSE WHO HAD COME THAT WAY BEFORE SEEKING THE FRUIT WHICH THE TRAVELLING SERVANT HAD SOUGHT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE SERVANT FOUND HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
6078-54013-0057 BUT WHAT A CHANGE HE BEHELD IT WAS A POOR COTTAGE NO LONGER BUT A SPLENDID PALACE FIT FOR A QUEEN TO DWELL IN
6078-54013-0058 AND SHE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES FIT FOR A QUEEN TO WEAR SHINING WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES THE SERVANT STOOD AND STARED LIKE ONE BEREFT OF WITS
6078-54013-0059 AN ANGEL CAME AND SHOWED THE WAY TO MY SON
6078-54013-0060 BUT TO BRING AN APPLE FOR ME ALSO THEN THE POOR TRAVELLING SERVANT BEGAN TO THUMP HIS HEAD HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THROUGH THE MILLSTONE NOW AND THAT HE TOO MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE OF THE FRUIT IF HE HAD BUT HELD HIS TONGUE A LITTLE LONGER
6078-54013-0061 THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD SEEN THE ANGEL SET FIRE TO THERE HE BEHELD MASONS AND CARPENTERS HARD AT WORK HACKING AND HEWING AND BUILDING A FINE NEW HOUSE AND THERE HE SAW THE POOR MAN HIMSELF STANDING BY GIVING THEM ORDERS HOW IS THIS SAID THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0062 FOR MANY A LONG DAY AND NEVER KNEW THAT A GREAT TREASURE OF SILVER AND GOLD WAS HIDDEN BENEATH IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO THERE CAME AN ANGEL
6078-54013-0063 THE NEXT MORNING THE POOR SERVANT JOGGED ALONG ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY MORE SAD AND DOWNCAST THAN EVER AND BY EVENING HE HAD COME TO THE ROBBERS DEN IN THE THICK WOODS AND THERE THE OLD WOMAN CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR TO MEET HIM
6078-54013-0064 HE GAVE IT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND AND AFTER HE HAD GONE THE ROBBERS FOUGHT FOR IT WITH ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY WERE ALL KILLED SO NOW THE WORLD IS RID OF THEM AND TRAVELLERS CAN COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE BACK JOGGED THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0065 AND THE NEXT DAY CAME TO THE TOWN AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN THERE LO AND BEHOLD INSTEAD OF BEING DARK AND SILENT AS IT WAS BEFORE ALL WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND NOISY WITH THE SOUND OF REJOICING AND MERRIMENT
6078-54013-0066 THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD STANDING AT THE DOOR AND HE KNEW THE SERVANT AS THE COMPANION OF THAT ONE WHO HAD STOLEN THE RUBY RING UP HE CAME AND LAID HOLD OF THE SERVANT BY THE COLLAR CALLING TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ONE OF THE THIEVES
6078-54013-0067 INTO THE HOUSE THEY HAULED THE POOR SERVANT AND INTO THE SAME ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THERE SAT THE YOUNG MAN AT A GRAND FEAST WITH HIS WIFE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AROUND HIM BUT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THE POOR SERVING MAN HE CAME TO HIM
6078-54013-0068 AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND SET HIM BESIDE HIMSELF AT THE TABLE
6078-54013-0069 IT WAS THE RING OF DISCORD THAT BRED STRIFE WHEREVER IT CAME
6078-54013-0070 MY WIFE AND ALL MY FRIENDS FELL OUT WITH ME AND WE QUARRELLED SO THAT THEY ALL LEFT ME BUT THOUGH I KNEW IT NOT AT THAT TIME YOUR COMRADE WAS AN ANGEL AND TOOK THE RING AWAY WITH HIM AND NOW I AM AS HAPPY AS I WAS SORROWFUL BEFORE
6078-54013-0071 RAP TAP TAP HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND THE WISE MAN WHO HAD BEEN HIS MASTER OPENED TO HIM
6078-54013-0072 VERY WELL SAID THE WISE MAN COME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR AND FOR ALL I KNOW THE TRAVELLING SERVANT IS THERE TO THIS DAY FOR HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD WHO HAS COME IN SIGHT OF THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS
6078-54013-0073 AND THEN JOGGED ALL THE WAY BACK HOME AGAIN TO COOK CABBAGE AND ONIONS AND POT HERBS AND TO MAKE BROTH FOR WISER MEN THAN HIMSELF TO SUP
6078-54013-0074 NO OFFENCE SAID THE BLACKSMITH I MEANT NOT TO SPEAK ILL OF YOUR STORY COME COME SIR WILL YOU NOT TAKE A POT OF ALE WITH ME WHY SAID SAINT GEORGE SOMEWHAT MOLLIFIED
6078-54013-0075 I WOULD AS LIEF AS NOT I LIKED THE STORY WELL ENOUGH PIPED UP THE LITTLE TAILOR WHO HAD KILLED SEVEN FLIES AT A BLOW TWAS A GOOD ENOUGH STORY OF ITS SORT BUT WHY DOES NOBODY TELL A TALE OF GOOD BIG GIANTS AND OF WILD BOARS AND OF UNICORNS
6078-54013-0076 SUCH AS I KILLED IN MY ADVENTURES YOU WOT OF OLD ALI BABA HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND HIS EYES CLOSED NOW HE OPENED THEM AND LOOKED AT THE LITTLE TAILOR
6078-54013-0077 WHO WAS AS BIG AS A GIANT AND SIX TIMES AS POWERFUL AND BESIDES THAT HE ADDED
6078-54013-0078 CLATTERED THE BOTTOM OF HIS CANICAN AGAINST THE TABLE
6078-54013-0079 COME FRIEND LET US HAVE IT STOP A BIT SAID FORTUNATUS WHAT IS THIS STORY MOSTLY ABOUT IT IS SAID ALI BABA ABOUT TWO MEN BETWIXT WHOM THERE WAS
2911-7601-0000 TRUE NERVOUS VERY VERY DREADFULLY NERVOUS I HAD BEEN AND AM BUT WHY WILL YOU SAY THAT I AM MAD THE DISEASE HAD SHARPENED MY SENSES NOT DESTROYED NOT DULLED THEM
2911-7601-0001 ABOVE ALL WAS THE SENSE OF HEARING ACUTE I HEARD ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVEN
2911-7601-0002 I HEARD MANY THINGS IN HELL HOW THEN AM I MAD HEARKEN AND OBSERVE HOW HEALTHILY HOW CALMLY I CAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW FIRST THE IDEA ENTERED MY BRAIN BUT ONCE CONCEIVED
2911-7601-0003 IT HAUNTED ME DAY AND NIGHT OBJECT THERE WAS NONE PASSION THERE WAS NONE I LOVED THE OLD MAN HE HAD NEVER WRONGED ME HE HAD NEVER GIVEN ME INSULT FOR HIS GOLD I HAD NO DESIRE I THINK IT WAS HIS EYE
2911-7601-0004 YES IT WAS THIS HE HAD THE EYE OF A VULTURE A PALE BLUE EYE WITH A FILM OVER IT WHENEVER IT FELL UPON ME MY BLOOD RAN COLD AND SO BY DEGREES VERY GRADUALLY
2911-7601-0005 I MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE THE LIFE OF THE OLD MAN AND THUS RID MYSELF OF THE EYE FOREVER NOW THIS IS THE POINT YOU FANCY ME MAD MADMEN KNOW NOTHING BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW WISELY I PROCEEDED
2911-7601-0006 WITH WHAT CAUTION WITH WHAT FORESIGHT WITH WHAT DISSIMULATION I WENT TO WORK I WAS NEVER KINDER TO THE OLD MAN THAN DURING THE WHOLE WEEK BEFORE I KILLED HIM AND EVERY NIGHT ABOUT MIDNIGHT I TURNED THE LATCH OF HIS DOOR AND OPENED IT
2911-7601-0007 OH SO GENTLY AND THEN WHEN I HAD MADE AN OPENING SUFFICIENT FOR MY HEAD I PUT IN A DARK LANTERN ALL CLOSED CLOSED THAT NO LIGHT SHONE OUT AND THEN I THRUST IN MY HEAD
2911-7601-0008 OH YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED TO SEE HOW CUNNINGLY I THRUST IT IN I MOVED IT SLOWLY VERY VERY SLOWLY SO THAT I MIGHT NOT DISTURB THE OLD MAN'S SLEEP IT TOOK ME AN HOUR TO PLACE MY WHOLE HEAD WITHIN THE OPENING
2911-7601-0009 SO FAR THAT I COULD SEE HIM AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED HA WOULD A MADMAN HAVE BEEN SO WISE AS THIS AND THEN WHEN MY HEAD WAS WELL IN THE ROOM I UNDID THE LANTERN CAUTIOUSLY OH SO CAUTIOUSLY
2911-7601-0010 FOR IT WAS NOT THE OLD MAN WHO VEXED ME BUT HIS EVIL EYE AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE DAY BROKE I WENT BOLDLY INTO THE CHAMBER AND SPOKE COURAGEOUSLY TO HIM CALLING HIM BY NAME IN A HEARTY TONE AND INQUIRING HOW HE HAS PASSED THE NIGHT
2911-7601-0011 SO YOU SEE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PROFOUND OLD MAN INDEED TO SUSPECT THAT EVERY NIGHT JUST AT TWELVE I LOOKED IN UPON HIM WHILE HE SLEPT UPON THE EIGHTH NIGHT I WAS MORE THAN USUALLY CAUTIOUS IN OPENING THE DOOR
2911-7601-0012 NEVER BEFORE THAT NIGHT HAD I FELT THE EXTENT OF MY OWN POWERS OF MY SAGACITY I COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN MY FEELINGS OF TRIUMPH TO THINK THAT THERE I WAS OPENING THE DOOR LITTLE BY LITTLE
2911-7601-0013 AND HE NOT EVEN TO DREAM OF MY SECRET DEEDS OR THOUGHTS I FAIRLY CHUCKLED AT THE IDEA AND PERHAPS HE HEARD ME FOR HE MOVED ON THE BED SUDDENLY AS IF STARTLED NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT I DREW BACK BUT NO
2911-7601-0014 HIS ROOM WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH WITH THE THICK DARKNESS FOR THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSE FASTENED THROUGH FEAR OF ROBBERS AND SO I KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OPENING OF THE DOOR
2911-7601-0015 STEADILY I HAD MY HEAD IN AND WAS ABOUT TO OPEN THE LANTERN WHEN MY THUMB SLIPPED UPON THE TIN FASTENING AND THE OLD MAN SPRANG UP IN BED CRYING OUT WHO'S THERE I KEPT QUITE STILL AND SAID NOTHING
2911-7601-0016 FOR A WHOLE HOUR I DID NOT MOVE A MUSCLE AND IN THE MEANTIME I DID NOT HEAR HIM LIE DOWN HE WAS STILL SITTING UP IN THE BED LISTENING JUST AS I HAVE DONE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HEARKENING TO THE DEATH WATCHES IN THE WALL
2911-7601-0017 PRESENTLY I HEARD A SLIGHT GROAN AND I KNEW IT WAS THE GROAN OF MORTAL TERROR IT WAS NOT A GROAN OF PAIN OR OF GRIEF OH NO
2911-7601-0018 WHEN OVERCHARGED WITH AWE I KNEW THE SOUND WELL MANY A NIGHT JUST AT MIDNIGHT WHEN ALL THE WORLD SLEPT
2911-7601-0019 DEEPENING WITH ITS DREADFUL ECHO THE TERRORS THAT DISTRACTED ME I SAY I KNEW IT WELL I KNEW WHAT THE OLD MAN FELT AND PITIED HIM ALTHOUGH I CHUCKLED AT HEART
2911-7601-0020 WHEN HE HAD TURNED IN THE BED HIS FEARS HAD BEEN EVER SINCE GROWING UPON HIM HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO FANCY THEM CAUSELESS BUT COULD NOT HE HAD BEEN SAYING TO HIMSELF IT IS NOTHING BUT THE WIND IN THE CHIMNEY
2911-7601-0021 IT IS ONLY A MOUSE CROSSING THE FLOOR OR IT IS MERELY A CRICKET WHICH HAS MADE A SINGLE CHIRP YES HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO COMFORT HIMSELF WITH THESE SUPPOSITIONS BUT HE HAD FOUND ALL IN VAIN ALL IN VAIN BECAUSE DEATH
2911-7601-0022 IN APPROACHING HIM HAD STALKED WITH HIS BLACK SHADOW BEFORE HIM AND ENVELOPED THE VICTIM AND IT WAS THE MOURNFUL INFLUENCE OF THE UNPERCEIVED SHADOW THAT CAUSED HIM TO FEEL ALTHOUGH HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD TO FEEL THE PRESENCE OF MY HEAD WITHIN THE ROOM
2911-7601-0023 WHEN I HAD WAITED A LONG TIME VERY PATIENTLY WITHOUT HEARING HIM LIE DOWN I RESOLVED TO OPEN A LITTLE A VERY VERY LITTLE CREVICE IN THE LANTERN SO I OPENED IT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW STEALTHILY
2911-7601-0024 STEALTHILY UNTIL AT LENGTH A SIMPLE DIM RAY LIKE THE THREAD OF THE SPIDER
2911-7601-0025 AND FELL FULL UPON THE VULTURE EYE IT WAS OPEN WIDE WIDE OPEN AND I GREW FURIOUS AS I GAZED UPON IT I SAW IT WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS ALL A DULL BLUE
2911-7601-0026 WITH A HIDEOUS VEIL OVER IT THAT CHILLED THE VERY MARROW IN MY BONES BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE OF THE OLD MAN'S FACE OR PERSON FOR I HAD DIRECTED THE RAY AS IF BY INSTINCT PRECISELY UPON THE DAMNED SPOT
2911-7601-0027 AND HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT WHAT YOU MISTAKE FOR MADNESS IS BUT OVER ACUTENESS OF THE SENSE NOW I SAY THERE CAME TO MY EARS
2911-7601-0028 SUCH AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I KNEW THAT SOUND WELL TOO IT WAS THE BEATING OF THE OLD MAN'S HEART IT INCREASED MY FURY AS THE BEATING OF A DRUM STIMULATES THE SOLDIER INTO COURAGE
2911-7601-0029 BUT EVEN YET I REFRAINED AND KEPT STILL I SCARCELY BREATHED I HELD THE LANTERN MOTIONLESS I TRIED HOW STEADILY I COULD MAINTAIN THE RAY
2911-7601-0030 MEANTIME THE HELLISH TATTOO OF THE HEART INCREASED IT GREW QUICKER AND QUICKER AND LOUDER AND LOUDER EVERY INSTANT THE OLD MAN'S TERROR MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREME IT GREW LOUDER I SAY LOUDER EVERY MOMENT
2911-7601-0031 DO YOU MARK ME WELL I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I AM NERVOUS SO I AM AND NOW AT THE DEAD HOUR OF THE NIGHT AMID THE DREADFUL SILENCE OF THAT OLD HOUSE SO STRANGE A NOISE AS THIS EXCITED ME TO UNCONTROLLABLE TERROR
2911-7601-0032 YET FOR SOME MINUTES LONGER I REFRAINED AND STOOD STILL BUT THE BEATING GREW LOUDER LOUDER I THOUGHT THE HEART MUST BURST AND NOW A NEW ANXIETY SEIZED ME THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR THE OLD MAN'S HOUR HAD COME
2911-7601-0033 WITH A LOUD YELL I THREW OPEN THE LANTERN AND LEAPED INTO THE ROOM HE SHRIEKED ONCE ONCE ONLY IN AN INSTANT I DRAGGED HIM TO THE FLOOR
2911-7601-0034 TO FIND THE DEED SO FAR DONE BUT FOR MANY MINUTES THE HEART BEAT ON WITH A MUFFLED SOUND THIS HOWEVER DID NOT VEX ME IT WOULD NOT BE HEARD THROUGH THE WALL AT LENGTH IT CEASED THE OLD MAN WAS DEAD
2911-7601-0035 I REMOVED THE BED AND EXAMINED THE CORPSE YES HE WAS STONE STONE DEAD I PLACED MY HAND UPON THE HEART AND HELD IT THERE MANY MINUTES THERE WAS NO PULSATION HE WAS STONE DEAD HIS EYE WOULD TROUBLE ME NO MORE
2911-7601-0036 IF STILL YOU THINK ME MAD YOU WILL THINK SO NO LONGER WHEN I DESCRIBE THE WISE PRECAUTIONS I TOOK FOR THE CONCEALMENT OF THE BODY THE NIGHT WANED AND I WORKED HASTILY BUT IN SILENCE FIRST OF ALL I DISMEMBERED THE CORPSE I CUT OFF THE HEAD
2911-7601-0037 AND DEPOSITED ALL BETWEEN THE SCANTLINGS I THEN REPLACED THE BOARDS SO CLEVERLY SO CUNNINGLY THAT NO HUMAN EYE NOT EVEN HIS COULD HAVE DETECTED ANY THING WRONG THERE WAS NOTHING TO WASH OUT NO STAIN OF ANY KIND
2911-7601-0038 NO BLOOD SPOT WHATEVER I HAD BEEN TOO WARY FOR THAT A TUB HAD CAUGHT ALL HA HA
2911-7601-0039 IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK STILL DARK AS MIDNIGHT AS THE BELL SOUNDED THE HOUR THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE STREET DOOR I WENT DOWN TO OPEN IT WITH A LIGHT HEART FOR WHAT HAD I NOW TO FEAR THERE ENTERED THREE MEN WHO INTRODUCED THEMSELVES
2911-7601-0040 WITH PERFECT SUAVITY AS OFFICERS OF THE POLICE A SHRIEK HAD BEEN HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR DURING THE NIGHT SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY HAD BEEN AROUSED INFORMATION HAD BEEN LODGED AT THE POLICE OFFICE AND THEY THE OFFICERS
2911-7601-0041 HAD BEEN DEPUTED TO SEARCH THE PREMISES I SMILED FOR WHAT HAD I TO FEAR I BADE THE GENTLEMEN WELCOME THE SHRIEK I SAID WAS MY OWN IN A DREAM THE OLD MAN I MENTIONED WAS ABSENT IN THE COUNTRY
2911-7601-0042 I TOOK MY VISITORS ALL OVER THE HOUSE I BADE THEM SEARCH SEARCH WELL I LED THEM AT LENGTH TO HIS CHAMBER I SHOWED THEM HIS TREASURES SECURE UNDISTURBED IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF MY CONFIDENCE
2911-7601-0043 PLACED MY OWN SEAT UPON THE VERY SPOT BENEATH WHICH REPOSED THE CORPSE OF THE VICTIM THE OFFICERS WERE SATISFIED MY MANNER HAD CONVINCED THEM I WAS SINGULARLY AT EASE THEY SAT AND WHILE I ANSWERED CHEERILY
2911-7601-0044 THEY CHATTED OF FAMILIAR THINGS BUT ERE LONG I FELT MYSELF GETTING PALE AND WISHED THEM GONE MY HEAD ACHED AND I FANCIED A RINGING IN MY EARS BUT STILL THEY SAT AND STILL CHATTED THE RINGING BECAME MORE DISTINCT IT CONTINUED
2911-7601-0045 AND BECAME MORE DISTINCT I TALKED MORE FREELY TO GET RID OF THE FEELING BUT IT CONTINUED AND GAINED DEFINITENESS UNTIL AT LENGTH I FOUND THAT THE NOISE WAS NOT WITHIN MY EARS NO DOUBT I NOW GREW VERY PALE BUT I TALKED MORE FLUENTLY
2911-7601-0046 AND WITH A HEIGHTENED VOICE YET THE SOUND INCREASED AND WHAT COULD I DO IT WAS A LOW DULL QUICK SOUND MUCH SUCH A SOUND AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I GASPED FOR BREATH AND YET THE OFFICERS HEARD IT NOT
2911-7601-0047 I TALKED MORE QUICKLY MORE VEHEMENTLY BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED I AROSE AND ARGUED ABOUT TRIFLES IN A HIGH KEY AND WITH VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE GONE
2911-7601-0048 I PACED THE FLOOR TO AND FRO WITH HEAVY STRIDES AS IF EXCITED TO FURY BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE MEN BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED OH GOD WHAT COULD I DO I FOAMED I RAVED I SWORE
2911-7601-0049 I SWUNG THE CHAIR UPON WHICH I HAD BEEN SITTING AND GRATED IT UPON THE BOARDS BUT THE NOISE AROSE OVER ALL AND CONTINUALLY INCREASED IT GREW LOUDER LOUDER LOUDER AND STILL THE MEN CHATTED PLEASANTLY AND SMILED
2911-7601-0050 WAS IT POSSIBLE THEY HEARD NOT ALMIGHTY GOD NO NO THEY HEARD THEY SUSPECTED THEY KNEW THEY WERE MAKING A MOCKERY OF MY HORROR THIS I THOUGHT AND THIS I THINK
2911-7601-0051 BUT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THIS AGONY ANYTHING WAS MORE TOLERABLE THAN THIS DERISION I COULD BEAR THOSE HYPOCRITICAL SMILES NO LONGER I FELT THAT I MUST SCREAM OR DIE AND NOW AGAIN HARK LOUDER LOUDER
2911-15084-0000 WOULD HAVE FORMED HIS CHRISTIAN EMPIRE IN THE WILDERNESS BUT ONE BY ONE THESE KINDRED PEOPLES WERE UPROOTED AND SWEPT AWAY WHILE THE NEIGHBORING ALGONQUINS TO WHOM THEY HAD BEEN A BULWARK WERE INVOLVED WITH THEM IN A COMMON RUIN
2911-15084-0001 FROM WHOSE CONVERSION IT WAS VAIN TO LOOK FOR THE SAME SOLID AND DECISIVE RESULTS IN A MEASURE THE OCCUPATION OF THE JESUITS WAS GONE SOME OF THEM WENT HOME WELL RESOLVED WRITES THE FATHER SUPERIOR
2911-15084-0002 ABOUT TWENTY IN NUMBER SEVERAL SOON FELL VICTIMS TO FAMINE
2911-15084-0003 THE GUNS AND TOMAHAWKS OF THE IROQUOIS WERE THE RUIN OF THEIR HOPES COULD THEY HAVE CURBED OR CONVERTED THOSE FEROCIOUS BANDS IT IS LITTLE LESS THAN CERTAIN
2911-15084-0004 SAVAGES TAMED NOT CIVILIZED FOR THAT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE VALLEYS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND THE MISSISSIPPI RULED BY PRIESTS IN THE INTEREST OF CATHOLICITY AND OF FRANCE
2911-15084-0005 UNMOLESTED BY INDIAN ENEMIES AND FED BY A RICH COMMERCE SHE WOULD HAVE PUT FORTH A VIGOROUS GROWTH TRUE TO HER FAR REACHING AND ADVENTUROUS GENIUS SHE WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED THE WEST WITH TRADERS SETTLERS AND GARRISONS
2911-15084-0006 WHILE AS YET THE COLONIES OF ENGLAND WERE BUT A WEAK AND BROKEN LINE ALONG THE SHORE OF THE ATLANTIC AND WHEN AT LAST THE GREAT CONFLICT CAME ENGLAND AND LIBERTY WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED
2911-15084-0007 NOT BY A DEPLETED ANTAGONIST STILL FEEBLE FROM THE EXHAUSTION OF A STARVED AND PERSECUTED INFANCY BUT BY AN ATHLETIC CHAMPION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RICHELIEU AND OF LOYOLA LIBERTY MAY THANK THE IROQUOIS THAT BY THEIR INSENSATE FURY
2911-15084-0008 AND A PERIL AND A WOE AVERTED FROM HER FUTURE THEY RUINED THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE LIFE BLOOD OF NEW FRANCE THEY STOPPED THE CURRENT OF HER ARTERIES AND MADE ALL HER EARLY YEARS A MISERY AND A TERROR NOT THAT THEY CHANGED HER DESTINIES
2911-15084-0009 THE CONTEST ON THIS CONTINENT BETWEEN LIBERTY AND ABSOLUTISM WAS NEVER DOUBTFUL BUT THE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEARLY BOUGHT AND THE DOWNFALL OF THE OTHER INCOMPLETE
2911-15084-0010 POPULATIONS FORMED IN THE IDEAS AND HABITS OF A FEUDAL MONARCHY AND CONTROLLED BY A HIERARCHY PROFOUNDLY HOSTILE TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE REMAINED A HINDRANCE AND A STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF THAT MAJESTIC EXPERIMENT
2911-15084-0011 OF WHICH AMERICA IS THE FIELD THE JESUITS SAW THEIR HOPES STRUCK DOWN AND THEIR FAITH THOUGH NOT SHAKEN WAS SORELY TRIED THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD SEEMED IN THEIR EYES DARK AND INEXPLICABLE BUT FROM THE STAND POINT OF LIBERTY
2911-15084-0012 THAT PROVIDENCE IS CLEAR AS THE SUN AT NOON MEANWHILE LET THOSE WHO HAVE PREVAILED YIELD DUE HONOR TO THE DEFEATED THEIR VIRTUES SHINE AMIDST THE RUBBISH OF ERROR LIKE DIAMONDS AND GOLD IN THE GRAVEL OF THE TORRENT
2911-15084-0013 BUT NOW NEW SCENES SUCCEED AND OTHER ACTORS ENTER ON THE STAGE A HARDY AND VALIANT BAND MOULDED TO ENDURE AND DARE
2911-15045-0000 NORTH AND SOUTH TRIBE WAS GIVING PLACE TO TRIBE LANGUAGE TO LANGUAGE FOR THE INDIAN HOPELESSLY UNCHANGING IN RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT WAS AS REGARDED TRIBAL RELATIONS AND LOCAL HAUNTS
2911-15045-0001 MUTABLE AS THE WIND IN CANADA AND THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THE UNITED STATES THE ELEMENTS OF CHANGE WERE ESPECIALLY ACTIVE THE INDIAN POPULATION WHICH IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FIVE CARTIER FOUND AT MONTREAL AND QUEBEC
2911-15045-0002 HAD DISAPPEARED AT THE OPENING OF THE NEXT CENTURY AND ANOTHER RACE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS WIDELY DIFFERENT WHILE IN THE REGION NOW FORMING THE STATE OF NEW YORK A POWER WAS RISING TO A FEROCIOUS VITALITY WHICH
2911-15045-0003 BUT FOR THE PRESENCE OF EUROPEANS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SUBJECTED ABSORBED OR EXTERMINATED EVERY OTHER INDIAN COMMUNITY EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND NORTH OF THE OHIO THE VAST TRACT OF WILDERNESS FROM THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE ATLANTIC
2911-15045-0004 AND FROM THE CAROLINAS TO HUDSON'S BAY WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO GREAT FAMILIES OF TRIBES DISTINGUISHED BY A RADICAL DIFFERENCE OF LANGUAGE A PART OF VIRGINIA AND OF PENNSYLVANIA NEW JERSEY SOUTHEASTERN NEW YORK NEW ENGLAND
2911-15045-0005 NEW BRUNSWICK NOVA SCOTIA AND LOWER CANADA WERE OCCUPIED SO FAR AS OCCUPIED AT ALL BY TRIBES SPEAKING VARIOUS ALGONQUIN LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS THEY EXTENDED MOREOVER ALONG THE SHORES OF THE UPPER LAKES
2911-15045-0006 WESTWARD THE ERIES ALONG THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF LAKE ERIE AND THE NEUTRAL NATION ALONG ITS NORTHERN SHORE FROM NIAGARA
2911-15045-0007 ON THE WHOLE THESE SAVAGES WERE FAVORABLE SPECIMENS OF THE ALGONQUIN STOCK BELONGING TO THAT SECTION OF IT WHICH TILLED THE SOIL AND WAS THUS IN SOME MEASURE SPARED THE EXTREMES OF MISERY AND DEGRADATION
2911-15045-0008 TO WHICH THE WANDERING HUNTER TRIBES WERE OFTEN REDUCED THEY OWED MUCH ALSO TO THE BOUNTY OF THE SEA AND HENCE THEY TENDED TOWARDS THE COAST WHICH BEFORE THE EPIDEMIC CHAMPLAIN AND SMITH HAD SEEN AT MANY POINTS STUDDED WITH WIGWAMS
2911-15045-0009 AND WAVING WITH HARVESTS OF MAIZE FEAR TOO DROVE THEM EASTWARD FOR THE IROQUOIS PURSUED THEM WITH AN INVETERATE ENMITY SOME PAID YEARLY TRIBUTE TO THEIR TYRANTS WHILE OTHERS WERE STILL SUBJECT TO THEIR INROADS
2911-15045-0010 FLYING IN TERROR AT THE SOUND OF THE MOHAWK WAR CRY WESTWARD THE POPULATION THINNED RAPIDLY NORTHWARD IT SOON DISAPPEARED NORTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE WHOLE OF VERMONT AND WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS HAD NO HUMAN TENANTS BUT THE ROVING HUNTER
2911-15045-0011 OR PROWLING WARRIOR WE HAVE SAID THAT THIS GROUP OF TRIBES WAS RELATIVELY VERY POPULOUS YET IT IS MORE THAN DOUBTFUL WHETHER ALL OF THEM UNITED HAD UNION BEEN POSSIBLE COULD HAVE MUSTERED EIGHT THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN TO SPEAK FURTHER OF THEM IS NEEDLESS
2911-15045-0012 AND THE WHOLE OF NEW BRUNSWICK WERE OCCUPIED
2911-15045-0013 TO WHOM AGRICULTURE WAS UNKNOWN THOUGH THE SEA PROLIFIC OF FISH LOBSTERS AND SEALS GREATLY LIGHTENED THEIR MISERIES
2911-15045-0014 OR MICMACS OF NOVA SCOTIA CLOSELY RESEMBLED THEM IN HABITS AND CONDITION FROM NOVA SCOTIA TO THE SAINT LAWRENCE THERE WAS NO POPULATION WORTHY OF THE NAME FROM THE GULF OF SAINT LAWRENCE TO LAKE ONTARIO THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE GREAT RIVER
2911-15045-0015 HAD NO TENANTS BUT HUNTERS NORTHWARD BETWEEN THE SAINT LAWRENCE AND HUDSON'S BAY ROAMED THE SCATTERED HORDES OF THE PAPINACHOIS BERSIAMITES AND OTHERS INCLUDED BY THE FRENCH UNDER THE GENERAL NAME
2911-15045-0016 WHEN IN SPRING THE FRENCH TRADING SHIPS ARRIVED AND ANCHORED IN THE PORT OF TADOUSSAC THEY GATHERED FROM FAR AND NEAR TOILING PAINFULLY THROUGH THE DESOLATION OF FORESTS MUSTERING BY HUNDREDS AT THE POINT OF TRAFFIC
2911-15045-0017 AND SETTING UP THEIR BARK WIGWAMS ALONG THE STRAND OF THAT WILD HARBOR
2911-15045-0018 THEIR ORDINARY SUSTENANCE WAS DERIVED FROM THE CHASE THOUGH OFTEN GOADED BY DEADLY FAMINE THEY WOULD SUBSIST ON ROOTS THE BARK AND BUDS OF TREES
2911-15045-0019 AND IN EXTREMITY EVEN CANNIBALISM WAS NOT RARE AMONG THEM ASCENDING THE SAINT LAWRENCE IT WAS SELDOM THAT THE SIGHT OF A HUMAN FORM GAVE RELIEF TO THE LONELINESS
2911-15045-0020 FROM THE VERGE OF THE CLIFF ANNOUNCED THAT THE SAVAGE PROLOGUE OF THE AMERICAN DRAMA WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE AND THAT THE CIVILIZATION OF EUROPE WAS ADVANCING ON THE SCENE ASCENDING FARTHER ALL WAS SOLITUDE EXCEPT AT THREE RIVERS
2911-15045-0021 A NOTED PLACE OF TRADE WHERE A FEW ALGONQUINS OF THE TRIBE CALLED ATTICAMEGUES MIGHT POSSIBLY BE SEEN
2911-15045-0022 AND AS THE VOYAGER PASSED SOME WOODED POINT OR THICKET COVERED ISLAND THE WHISTLING OF A STONE HEADED ARROW PROCLAIMED PERHAPS THE PRESENCE OF THESE FIERCE MARAUDERS AT MONTREAL THERE WAS NO HUMAN LIFE SAVE DURING A BRIEF SPACE IN EARLY SUMMER
2911-15045-0023 WHEN THE SHORE SWARMED WITH SAVAGES WHO HAD COME TO THE YEARLY TRADE FROM THE GREAT COMMUNITIES OF THE INTERIOR
2911-15045-0024 TO MORROW ALL AGAIN WAS SOLITUDE AND THE OTTAWA WAS COVERED WITH THE CANOES OF THE RETURNING WARRIORS ALONG THIS STREAM A MAIN ROUTE OF TRAFFIC THE SILENCE OF THE WILDERNESS WAS BROKEN ONLY BY THE SPLASH OF THE PASSING PADDLE
2911-15045-0025 TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER THERE WAS INDEED A SMALL ALGONQUIN BAND CALLED LA PETITE NATION TOGETHER WITH ONE OR TWO OTHER FEEBLE COMMUNITIES BUT THEY DWELT FAR FROM THE BANKS THROUGH FEAR OF THE UBIQUITOUS IROQUOIS
2911-15045-0026 IT WAS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILES BY THE WINDINGS OF THE STREAM BEFORE ONE REACHED THAT ALGONQUIN TRIBE
2911-15045-0027 THEN AFTER MANY A DAY OF LONELY TRAVEL THE VOYAGER FOUND A SAVAGE WELCOME AMONG THE NIPISSINGS ON THE LAKE WHICH BEARS THEIR NAME AND THEN CIRCLING WEST AND SOUTH FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES OF SOLITUDE
2911-15045-0028 HE REACHED FOR THE FIRST TIME A PEOPLE SPEAKING A DIALECT OF THE IROQUOIS TONGUE HERE ALL WAS CHANGED POPULOUS TOWNS RUDE FORTIFICATIONS AND AN EXTENSIVE THOUGH BARBAROUS TILLAGE
2911-15045-0029 INDICATED A PEOPLE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE FAMISHED WANDERERS OF THE SAGUENAY OR THEIR LESS ABJECT KINDRED OF NEW ENGLAND
89-219-0000 INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
89-219-0001 SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
89-219-0002 AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
89-219-0003 IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
89-219-0004 SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0005 TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
89-219-0006 FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
89-219-0007 FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
89-219-0008 AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
89-219-0009 BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0010 AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
89-219-0011 AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
89-219-0012 BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
89-219-0013 MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
89-219-0014 THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
89-219-0015 WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
89-219-0016 HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
89-219-0017 HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
89-219-0018 SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
89-219-0019 OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
89-219-0020 I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
89-219-0021 THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
89-219-0022 DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
89-219-0023 BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
89-219-0024 HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
89-219-0025 AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
89-219-0026 AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
89-219-0027 THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
89-219-0028 THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0029 HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
89-219-0030 CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
89-219-0031 NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
89-219-0032 IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
89-219-0033 AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
89-219-0034 AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
89-219-0035 THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
89-219-0036 AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
89-219-0037 THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
89-219-0038 AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
89-219-0039 WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
89-219-0040 OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
89-219-0041 WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
89-219-0042 BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
89-219-0043 HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
89-219-0044 HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
89-219-0045 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
89-219-0046 SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
89-219-0047 IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
89-219-0048 HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
89-219-0049 AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
89-219-0050 OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
89-219-0051 CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
89-219-0052 ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
89-219-0053 MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
89-219-0054 I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
89-219-0055 A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
89-219-0056 WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
89-219-0057 WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
89-219-0058 HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
89-219-0059 SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
89-219-0060 IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
89-219-0061 IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
89-219-0062 SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
89-219-0063 AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
89-219-0064 THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
7178-34645-0000 PICKED UP ON THE SAND AT LOW WATER A FLASK COVERED WITH WICKER WHICH HAD BEEN CAST UP BY THE TIDE THIS FLASK COVERED WITH MOULD WAS CORKED BY A TARRED BUNG THE SOLDIER CARRIED THE WAIF TO THE COLONEL OF THE CASTLE

7178-34645-0003 WE MUST NOT CONFOUND THIS CHANCELLOR WITH HIS NAMESAKE AND CONTEMPORARY WILLIAM COWPER THE ANATOMIST AND COMMENTATOR ON BIDLOO WHO PUBLISHED A TREATISE ON MUSCLES IN ENGLAND
7178-34645-0004 A SURGEON IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM A LORD LORD WILLIAM COWPER IS CELEBRATED FOR HAVING WITH REFERENCE TO THE AFFAIR OF TALBOT YELVERTON VISCOUNT LONGUEVILLE PROPOUNDED THIS OPINION
7178-34645-0005 THAT IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION THE RESTORATION OF A PEER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RESTORATION OF A KING
7178-34645-0006 THE AUTHOR OF A MAXIM DELIGHTS IN OPPORTUNITIES TO WHICH IT MAY BE APPLIED HERE WAS A CASE OF THE RESTORATION OF A PEER SEARCH WAS MADE GWYNPLAINE BY THE INSCRIPTION OVER HIS DOOR
7178-34645-0007 WAS SOON FOUND NEITHER WAS HARDQUANONNE DEAD A PRISON ROTS A MAN BUT PRESERVES HIM IF TO KEEP IS TO PRESERVE

7178-34645-0009 THE FACTS WERE FOUND TO BE CORRECT THEY OBTAINED FROM THE LOCAL ARCHIVES AT VEVEY AT LAUSANNE THE CERTIFICATE OF LORD LINNAEUS'S MARRIAGE IN EXILE THE CERTIFICATE OF HIS CHILD'S BIRTH THE CERTIFICATE OF THE DECEASE OF THE FATHER AND MOTHER
7178-34645-0010 AND WITH THAT MOLE LIKE SILENCE RECOMMENDED AND PRACTISED BY BACON AND LATER ON MADE LAW BY BLACKSTONE FOR AFFAIRS CONNECTED WITH THE CHANCELLORSHIP AND THE STATE AND IN MATTERS TERMED PARLIAMENTARY

7178-34645-0012 WHOSE CREDIT REQUIRED THE CONCEALMENT OF SUCH ACTS HAVE ALLOWED THAT TO BE WRITTEN WHICH ENDANGERED THEIR SUCCESS THE ANSWER IS CYNICISM HAUGHTY INDIFFERENCE OH
7178-34645-0013 YOU BELIEVE THAT EFFRONTERY IS CONFINED TO ABANDONED WOMEN
7178-34645-0014 OFTEN WHEN IT WOULD BE TO A MAN'S GREATEST ADVANTAGE TO ESCAPE FROM THE HANDS OF THE POLICE OR THE RECORDS OF HISTORY
7178-34645-0015 LOOK AT MY ARM OBSERVE THE DESIGN I AM LACENAIRE SEE A TEMPLE OF LOVE AND A BURNING HEART PIERCED THROUGH WITH AN ARROW
7178-34645-0016 JAMES THE SECOND A MAN COMMITS A BAD ACTION AND PLACES HIS MARK UPON IT TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF CRIME BY EFFRONTERY TO DENOUNCE HIMSELF TO CLING TO HIS MISDEEDS IS THE INSOLENT BRAVADO OF THE CRIMINAL
7178-34645-0017 CHRISTINA SEIZED MONALDESCHI HAD HIM CONFESSED AND ASSASSINATED AND SAID I AM THE QUEEN OF SWEDEN IN THE PALACE OF THE KING OF FRANCE
7178-34645-0018 THERE IS THE TYRANT WHO CONCEALS HIMSELF LIKE TIBERIUS AND THE TYRANT WHO DISPLAYS HIMSELF

7178-34645-0020 HIS CRIMES LAY LIGHT UPON HIS CONSCIENCE HE WAS A MONSTER BY THE GRACE OF GOD THEREFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO DISSIMULATE NOR TO EXTENUATE AND HIS ASSASSINATIONS WERE BY DIVINE RIGHT
7178-34645-0021 HE TOO WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED LEAVING BEHIND HIM THOSE ARCHIVES OF SIMANCAS WITH ALL HIS MISDEEDS DATED CLASSIFIED LABELLED AND PUT IN ORDER EACH IN ITS COMPARTMENT LIKE POISONS IN THE CABINET OF A CHEMIST
7178-34645-0022 TO SET THE SIGN MANUAL TO CRIMES IS RIGHT ROYAL EVERY DEED DONE IS A DRAFT DRAWN ON THE GREAT INVISIBLE PAYMASTER A BILL HAD JUST COME DUE WITH THE OMINOUS ENDORSEMENT
7178-34645-0023 JUSSU REGIS QUEEN ANNE IN ONE PARTICULAR UNFEMININE SEEING THAT SHE COULD KEEP A SECRET DEMANDED A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT OF SO GRAVE A MATTER FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR

7178-34645-0025 IT WAS AN ANCIENT CARLOVINGIAN OFFICE THE AURICULARIUS OF THE OLD PALATINE DEEDS HE WHO WHISPERS TO THE EMPEROR WILLIAM BARON COWPER CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND
7178-34645-0026 WHOM THE QUEEN BELIEVED IN BECAUSE HE WAS SHORT SIGHTED LIKE HERSELF OR EVEN MORE SO HAD COMMITTED TO WRITING A MEMORANDUM COMMENCING THUS TWO BIRDS WERE SUBJECT TO SOLOMON A LAPWING THE HUDBUD
7178-34645-0027 THE LORD CHANCELLOR PROVED THE FACT THAT THE HEIR TO A PEERAGE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF MUTILATED AND THEN RESTORED
7178-34645-0028 THE QUEEN'S FATHER HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO JUSTIFY HIM FIRST THERE ARE ANCIENT MONARCHICAL MAXIMS E SENIORATU ERIPIMUS IN ROTURAGIO CADAT
7178-34645-0029 SECONDLY THERE IS A ROYAL RIGHT OF MUTILATION
7178-34645-0030 THE EYES OF DUKES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL HAVE BEEN PLUCKED OUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE KINGDOM CERTAIN PRINCES TOO NEAR TO THE THRONE HAVE BEEN CONVENIENTLY STIFLED BETWEEN MATTRESSES
7178-34645-0031 AND HIS AMBASSADORS HAVE NOT BEEN THE LESS FAVOURABLY RECEIVED BY THE EMPEROR HENCE THE KING MAY ORDER THE SUPPRESSION OF A LIMB LIKE THE SUPPRESSION OF A STATE ET CETERA IT IS LEGAL BUT ONE LAW DOES NOT DESTROY ANOTHER
7178-34645-0032 IF A DROWNED MAN IS CAST UP BY THE WATER AND IS NOT DEAD IT IS AN ACT OF GOD READJUSTING ONE OF THE KING IF THE HEIR BE FOUND LET THE CORONET BE GIVEN BACK TO HIM
7178-34645-0033 THUS SHOULD BE DONE TO GWYNPLAINE WHO IS ALSO A KING SEEING THAT HE IS A PEER
7178-34645-0034 UNDER CONSTRAINT OF SUPERIOR POWER DOES NOT TARNISH THE BLAZON AS IN THE CASE OF ABDOLMUMEN WHO WAS A KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A GARDENER THAT OF JOSEPH WHO WAS A SAINT ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A CARPENTER
7178-34645-0035 THAT OF APOLLO WHO WAS A GOD ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A SHEPHERD IN SHORT THE LEARNED CHANCELLOR CONCLUDED BY ADVISING THE REINSTATEMENT IN ALL HIS ESTATES AND DIGNITIES OF LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34645-0036 MISCALLED GWYNPLAINE ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH THE CRIMINAL HARDQUANONNE AND IDENTIFIED BY THE SAME AND ON THIS POINT THE CHANCELLOR AS CONSTITUTIONAL KEEPER OF THE ROYAL CONSCIENCE
7178-34645-0037 BASED THE ROYAL DECISION THE LORD CHANCELLOR ADDED IN A POSTSCRIPT
7178-34645-0038 FOR IF THE PRISONER DIES ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY THE CONFRONTATION BECOMES DIFFICULT STILL THE LAW MUST BE OBEYED
481-123720-0000 ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
481-123720-0001 I KNEW OF COURSE THAT THEY MUST DESPISE ME NOW FOR MY LACK OF SUCCESS IN THE SERVICE AND FOR MY HAVING LET MYSELF SINK SO LOW GOING ABOUT BADLY DRESSED AND SO ON WHICH SEEMED TO THEM A SIGN OF MY INCAPACITY AND INSIGNIFICANCE
481-123720-0002 BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
481-123720-0003 ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
481-123720-0004 THIS ZVERKOV HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME AT SCHOOL WITH ME TOO I HAD BEGUN TO HATE HIM PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER FORMS IN THE LOWER FORMS HE HAD SIMPLY BEEN A PRETTY PLAYFUL BOY WHOM EVERYBODY LIKED I HAD HATED HIM HOWEVER EVEN IN THE LOWER FORMS
481-123720-0005 JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
481-123720-0006 AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
481-123720-0007 IN SPITE OF SUPERFICIAL FANTASTIC AND SHAM NOTIONS OF HONOUR AND DIGNITY ALL BUT VERY FEW OF US POSITIVELY GROVELLED BEFORE ZVERKOV AND THE MORE SO THE MORE HE SWAGGERED AND IT WAS NOT FROM ANY INTERESTED MOTIVE
481-123720-0008 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
481-123720-0009 I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
481-123720-0010 THOUGH HE WAS BOLD IN HIS LANGUAGE I HATED HIS HANDSOME BUT STUPID FACE FOR WHICH I WOULD HOWEVER HAVE GLADLY EXCHANGED MY INTELLIGENT ONE AND THE FREE AND EASY MILITARY MANNERS IN FASHION IN THE FORTIES
481-123720-0011 I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
481-123720-0012 I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
481-123720-0013 HE ALL AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE A SINGLE VILLAGE GIRL ON HIS ESTATE UNNOTICED
481-123720-0014 AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
481-123720-0015 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
481-123720-0016 THE LAUGH WAS ON HIS SIDE HE GOT THE BETTER OF ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AFTERWARDS BUT WITHOUT MALICE JESTINGLY CASUALLY I REMAINED ANGRILY AND CONTEMPTUOUSLY SILENT AND WOULD NOT ANSWER HIM WHEN WE LEFT SCHOOL HE MADE ADVANCES TO ME
481-123720-0017 I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
481-123720-0018 BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
481-123720-0019 BY THEN HE WAS WEARING SHOULDER STRAPS HE WAS TWISTING AND TWIRLING ABOUT INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF AN ANCIENT GENERAL IN THREE YEARS HE HAD GONE OFF CONSIDERABLY THOUGH HE WAS STILL RATHER HANDSOME AND ADROIT
481-123720-0020 ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
481-123720-0021 THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
481-123720-0022 A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
481-123720-0023 OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
481-123720-0024 A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
481-123720-0025 GAVE HIM A CERTAIN IMPORTANCE AMONG US HE ALWAYS THOUGHT ME OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME THOUGH NOT QUITE COURTEOUS WAS TOLERABLE WELL WITH SEVEN ROUBLES EACH SAID TRUDOLYUBOV TWENTY ONE ROUBLES BETWEEN THE THREE OF US
481-123720-0026 WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
481-123720-0027 LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
481-123720-0028 SO THE THREE OF US WITH ZVERKOV FOR THE FOURTH
481-123720-0029 SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
481-123720-0030 TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
481-123720-0031 DO YOU WANT TO JOIN TOO SIMONOV OBSERVED WITH NO APPEARANCE OF PLEASURE SEEMING TO AVOID LOOKING AT ME HE KNEW ME THROUGH AND THROUGH IT INFURIATED ME THAT HE KNEW ME SO THOROUGHLY WHY NOT
481-123720-0032 I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
481-123720-0033 BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
481-123720-0034 THAT I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM OH THERE'S NO MAKING YOU OUT WITH THESE REFINEMENTS TRUDOLYUBOV JEERED WE'LL PUT YOUR NAME DOWN SIMONOV DECIDED ADDRESSING ME
481-123720-0035 WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
481-123720-0036 BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
481-123720-0037 TRUDOLYUBOV BARELY NODDED SIMONOV WITH WHOM I WAS LEFT TETE A TETE WAS IN A STATE OF VEXATION AND PERPLEXITY AND LOOKED AT ME QUEERLY
481-123720-0038 WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
481-123720-0039 WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
481-123720-0040 VEXED THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN PAY TOMORROW AFTER THE DINNER I SIMPLY WANTED TO KNOW PLEASE DON'T HE BROKE OFF AND BEGAN PACING THE ROOM STILL MORE VEXED AS HE WALKED HE BEGAN TO STAMP WITH HIS HEELS
481-123720-0041 AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
481-123720-0042 THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
481-123720-0043 MY GOODNESS WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO I CRIED
481-123720-0044 IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
481-123720-0045 HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
481-123720-0046 I HAD BETTER NOT GO OF COURSE I MUST JUST SNAP MY FINGERS AT THEM
481-123720-0047 BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
481-123720-0048 I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
481-123720-0049 NOT TO PAY HIM WAS IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING HIS CHARACTER BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FELLOW ABOUT THAT PLAGUE OF MINE ANOTHER TIME HOWEVER I KNEW I SHOULD GO AND SHOULD NOT PAY HIM HIS WAGES THAT NIGHT I HAD THE MOST HIDEOUS DREAMS
481-123720-0050 I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
481-123720-0051 AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
481-123720-0052 I COULD NOT GIVE IN TO THEM WITH THE IGNOBLE READINESS WITH WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO ONE ANOTHER I HATED THEM FROM THE FIRST AND SHUT MYSELF AWAY FROM EVERYONE IN TIMID WOUNDED AND DISPROPORTIONATE PRIDE
481-123720-0053 THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
481-123720-0054 HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
481-123720-0055 THEIR GAMES THEIR CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH ESSENTIAL THINGS THEY TOOK NO INTEREST IN SUCH STRIKING IMPRESSIVE SUBJECTS THAT I COULD NOT HELP CONSIDERING THEM INFERIOR TO MYSELF
481-123720-0056 IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
481-123720-0057 THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
481-123720-0058 THEY WERE MONSTROUSLY DEPRAVED OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT TOO WAS SUPERFICIAL AND AN ASSUMPTION OF CYNICISM OF COURSE THERE WERE GLIMPSES OF YOUTH AND FRESHNESS EVEN IN THEIR DEPRAVITY BUT EVEN THAT FRESHNESS WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE
481-123720-0059 AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
481-123720-0060 ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
481-123720-0061 MOREOVER THEY ALL BEGAN BY DEGREES TO GRASP THAT I HAD ALREADY READ BOOKS NONE OF THEM COULD READ AND UNDERSTOOD THINGS NOT FORMING PART OF OUR SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT EVEN HEARD THEY TOOK A SAVAGE AND SARCASTIC VIEW OF IT
481-123720-0062 BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
481-123720-0063 WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
481-123720-0064 ONCE INDEED I DID HAVE A FRIEND
481-123720-0065 AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
481-123720-0066 THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
481-123720-0067 AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHY AFTER ALL THAT I SHOULD GO TRUDGING OFF TO SIMONOV'S EARLY NEXT MORNING I ROUSED MYSELF AND JUMPED OUT OF BED WITH EXCITEMENT AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL ABOUT TO HAPPEN AT ONCE
481-123720-0068 BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
481-123720-0069 I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
481-123720-0070 AND THEY ALL AGITATED AND OVERWHELMED ME I POLISHED MY BOOTS A SECOND TIME WITH MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE INDUCED APOLLON TO CLEAN THEM TWICE A DAY AS HE CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS DUTIES REQUIRED OF HIM
481-123720-0071 I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
481-123720-0072 I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0073 I HAD A FOREBODING THAT THAT STAIN WOULD DEPRIVE ME OF NINE TENTHS OF MY PERSONAL DIGNITY I KNEW TOO THAT IT WAS VERY POOR TO THINK SO BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR THINKING NOW I AM IN FOR THE REAL THING I THOUGHT AND MY HEART SANK
481-123720-0074 I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
481-123720-0075 WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
481-123720-0076 WITH WHAT IMPUDENT RUDENESS THE INSECT FERFITCHKIN WOULD SNIGGER AT ME IN ORDER TO CURRY FAVOUR WITH ZVERKOV HOW COMPLETELY SIMONOV WOULD TAKE IT ALL IN AND HOW HE WOULD DESPISE ME FOR THE ABJECTNESS OF MY VANITY AND LACK OF SPIRIT
481-123720-0077 AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
481-123720-0078 BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
481-123720-0079 ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
481-123720-0080 OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
481-123720-0081 WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
481-123720-0082 TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
481-123720-0083 OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
481-123720-0084 OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
481-123720-0085 WHO HAD BEEN ALL DAY EXPECTING HIS MONTH'S WAGES BUT IN HIS FOOLISHNESS WAS UNWILLING TO BE THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT IT I SLIPPED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR AND JUMPING INTO A HIGH CLASS SLEDGE ON WHICH I SPENT MY LAST HALF ROUBLE
198-129977-0000 ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
198-129977-0001 WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
198-129977-0002 BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
198-129977-0003 HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
198-129977-0004 AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
198-129977-0005 THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
198-129977-0006 WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
198-129977-0007 WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
198-129977-0008 THE HILLS ARE STEEP THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER
198-129977-0009 I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
198-129977-0010 I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
198-129977-0011 AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
198-129977-0012 IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
198-129977-0013 BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
198-129977-0014 BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
198-129977-0015 I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
198-129977-0016 MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
198-129977-0017 TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
198-129977-0018 BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
198-129977-0019 HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
198-129977-0020 THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
198-129977-0021 SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
198-129977-0022 THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
198-129977-0023 BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
198-129977-0024 THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
198-129977-0025 BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
198-129977-0026 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
198-129977-0027 MISSUS JENNINGS ENFORCED THE NECESSITY AND WHO KNOWS BUT YOU MAY RAISE A DANCE SAID SHE AND THAT WILL TEMPT YOU MISS MARIANNE A DANCE CRIED MARIANNE IMPOSSIBLE WHO IS TO DANCE WHO WHY YOURSELVES AND THE CAREYS AND WHITAKERS TO BE SURE
198-129977-0028 WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
198-129977-0029 AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
198-129977-0030 EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
198-129977-0031 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
198-129977-0032 HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
198-209-0000 MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
198-209-0001 CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
198-209-0002 AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
198-209-0003 TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY WHO SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT LOOKED AT THE NUMBER
198-209-0004 AND WITH A LOOK WHICH DID NOT QUITE CONFIRM HIS WORDS SAID HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR THAT MISS TILNEY WAS WALKED OUT CATHERINE WITH A BLUSH OF MORTIFICATION LEFT THE HOUSE SHE FELT ALMOST PERSUADED THAT MISS TILNEY WAS AT HOME AND TOO MUCH OFFENDED TO ADMIT HER
198-209-0005 AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
198-209-0006 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET HOWEVER SHE LOOKED BACK AGAIN AND THEN NOT AT A WINDOW BUT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR SHE SAW MISS TILNEY HERSELF SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENTLEMAN WHOM CATHERINE BELIEVED TO BE HER FATHER AND THEY TURNED UP TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
198-209-0007 CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
198-209-0008 TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
198-209-0009 FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
198-209-0010 TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
198-209-0011 ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
198-209-0012 EVERY OTHER LOOK UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY WITHOUT BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY
198-209-0013 HIS NOTICE WAS NEVER WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAGE DURING TWO WHOLE SCENES
198-209-0014 AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION FEELINGS RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION INSTEAD OF PROUDLY RESOLVING IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
198-209-0015 TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY AVOIDING HIS SIGHT OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT
198-209-0016 OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
198-209-0017 AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX SHE WAS RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES HE APPEARED
198-209-0018 YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME SO RUDE BUT INDEED IT WAS NOT MY OWN FAULT WAS IT MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT THEY TELL ME THAT MISTER TILNEY AND HIS SISTER WERE GONE OUT IN A PHAETON TOGETHER AND THEN WHAT COULD I DO BUT I HAD TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE BEEN WITH YOU
198-209-0019 MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
198-209-0020 AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
198-209-0021 BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
198-209-0022 I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A DECLARATION HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN REGRET
198-209-0023 AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
198-209-0024 PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
198-209-0025 AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
198-209-0026 AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION YET A SOMETHING OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE GENTLEMAN BUT MISTER TILNEY
198-209-0027 WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR SISTER IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND COULD SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE OFFENCE ME I TAKE OFFENCE
198-209-0028 NAY I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX YOU WERE ANGRY I ANGRY I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT WELL NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE HE REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM AND TALKING OF THE PLAY HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME
198-209-0029 AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY BEFORE THEY PARTED HOWEVER IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX
198-209-0030 SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
198-209-0031 WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL TILNEY
198-209-0032 WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
198-209-0033 AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER COMPANION HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS FATHER LIKE EVERY MILITARY MAN
198-209-0034 WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
198-209-0035 IN A CONSEQUENTIAL MANNER WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN HIM TALKING WITH GENERAL TILNEY HE IS A FINE OLD FELLOW UPON MY SOUL STOUT ACTIVE LOOKS AS YOUNG AS HIS SON I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM I ASSURE YOU
198-209-0036 KNOW HIM THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE MUCH ABOUT TOWN THAT I DO NOT KNOW I HAVE MET HIM FOREVER AT THE BEDFORD AND I KNEW HIS FACE AGAIN TODAY THE MOMENT HE CAME INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE BY THE BY AND WE HAD A LITTLE TOUCH TOGETHER THOUGH I WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM AT FIRST
198-209-0037 THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME AND IF I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN THIS WORLD I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT A TABLE HOWEVER I DID BEAT HIM A VERY FINE FELLOW AS RICH AS A JEW
198-209-0038 LOWERING HIS VOICE WELL DONE GENERAL SAID I I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND
374-180299-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
374-180299-0001 IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
374-180299-0002 BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO NIGHT AT EIGHT
374-180299-0003 WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE YES HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
374-180299-0004 BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
374-180299-0005 NO AT POINT DU JOUR WHERE WE HAD DINNER THE DUKE AND I
374-180299-0006 I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
374-180299-0007 HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
374-180299-0008 AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
374-180299-0009 AND WHEN SHALL YOU MOVE INTO THE HOUSE INQUIRED PRUDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HORSES AND CARRIAGE I SHALL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE AND YOU CAN LOOK AFTER MY PLACE WHILE I AM AWAY
374-180299-0010 A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
374-180299-0011 PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME
374-180299-0012 ASKING FOR A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS PROFESSEDLY ON BEHALF OF MARGUERITE YOU KNOW I HAD WON SOME MONEY AT GAMBLING I THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY HANDED OVER TO PRUDENCE WHAT SHE ASKED FOR MARGUERITE
374-180299-0013 AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
374-180299-0014 HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
374-180299-0015 AND HAVING FALLEN UPON A PARTY OF FIFTEEN WHO WERE STILL AT LUNCH AT AN HOUR WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER HE HAD UNSUSPECTINGLY OPENED THE DINING ROOM DOOR AND HAD BEEN GREETED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER
374-180299-0016 MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
374-180299-0017 AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
374-180299-0018 SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
374-180299-0019 FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
374-180299-0020 AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME
374-180299-0021 AND THAT HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING ME CONSTANTLY WITH HER ADDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT WERE FREE TO STAY AWAY SO MUCH I HAD HEARD ONE DAY WHEN PRUDENCE HAD SAID TO MARGUERITE
374-180299-0022 THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
374-180299-0023 WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
374-180299-0024 AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
374-180299-0025 AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING
374-180299-0026 AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
374-180299-0027 WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
374-180299-0028 AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
374-180299-0029 I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
374-180299-0030 COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
374-180299-0031 NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
374-180299-0032 AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
374-180299-0033 SAID SHE TURNING TO PRUDENCE AND SPEAKING IN A BROKEN VOICE YOU CAN REPORT THIS SCENE TO THE DUKE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT WE HAVE NO LONGER NEED OF HIM FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DUKE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO
374-180299-0034 MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
374-180299-0035 ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
374-180299-0036 WAS THAT MARGUERITE GAUTIER WHO ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN THE TALK OF THE TOWN FOR THE LUXURY AND SCANDAL OF HER EXISTENCE ALAS WE MADE HASTE TO BE HAPPY AS IF WE KNEW THAT WE WERE NOT TO BE HAPPY LONG
374-180299-0037 FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
374-180299-0038 I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
374-180299-0039 WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN
374-180299-0040 AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON FLY THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
374-180299-0041 IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
374-180299-0042 THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
374-180299-0043 HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
374-180299-0044 AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
374-180299-0045 THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
374-180299-0046 I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
40-222-0000 CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
40-222-0001 MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
40-222-0002 THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
40-222-0003 SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
40-222-0004 IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
40-222-0005 THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
40-222-0006 THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
40-222-0007 BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
40-222-0008 THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
40-222-0009 LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
40-222-0010 CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
40-222-0011 AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
40-222-0012 MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
40-222-0013 THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
40-222-0014 UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
40-222-0015 AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
40-222-0016 UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
40-222-0017 SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
40-222-0018 AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
40-222-0019 AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
40-222-0020 AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
40-222-0021 THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
40-222-0022 AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
40-222-0023 HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
40-222-0024 SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
40-222-0025 THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN

40-222-0062 YOU THINK IT IS ALL FOR AMBITION THEN AND UPON MY WORD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY LIKE IT I CANNOT FORGET THAT WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO FOR THEM SHE SEEMED QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE
40-222-0063 I NEVER WAS SO DECEIVED IN ANYONE'S CHARACTER IN MY LIFE BEFORE AMONG ALL THE GREAT VARIETY THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT AND LOSS IN HER IS VERY GREAT BUT AS FOR POOR JAMES

40-222-0067 THAT I AM NEVER TO HEAR FROM HER PERHAPS NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN
40-222-0068 WHAT IS MOST TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE SUCH FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEMSELVES
7278-246956-0000 AFTER THE SERMON AS THE SERMON DREW TO A CLOSE AND THE MIST OF HIS EMOTION BEGAN TO DISPERSE INDIVIDUAL FACES OF HIS AUDIENCE AGAIN DAWNED OUT ON THE PREACHER'S KEN
7278-246956-0001 MISTER DREW'S HEAD WAS DOWN AS I HAVE ALWAYS SAID CERTAIN THINGS HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD PRACTISED IN HIS MANHOOD CERTAIN MEAN WAYS COUNTED HONEST ENOUGH IN THE TRADE HAD BECOME TO HIM
7278-246956-0002 REGARDED FROM THE IDEAL POINT OF THE DIVINE IN
7278-246956-0003 OF THE ADVANTAGES HE TOOK FOR HE KNEW THAT HE HAD KNOWN THEM SUCH AS SHRUNK FROM THE LIGHT NOT COMING
7278-246956-0004 HE WAS NOW DOING HIS BEST TO BANISH THEM FROM HIS BUSINESS AND YET THEY WERE A PAINFUL PRESENCE TO HIS SPIRIT SO GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE
7278-246956-0005 FROM THEM BY THE INDWELLING PRESENCE OF THE GOD OF ALL LIVING MEN AND TRUE MERCHANTS WAS A BLESSEDNESS UNSPEAKABLE SMALL WAS THE SUSPICION IN THE ABBEY CHURCH OF OLASTON THAT MORNING
7278-246956-0006 BATTERY OF SIN SPRUNG SUFFERING WITHSTANDING AND ENDURING AND STILLING THE RECOIL OF THE AWFUL FORCE WHEREWITH HIS FATHER HAD LAUNCHED THE WORLDS AND GIVEN BIRTH TO HUMAN SOULS
7278-246956-0007 WITH WILLS THAT MIGHT BECOME FREE AS HIS OWN WHILE WINGFOLD HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN GENERAL TERMS WITH THE RACE IN HIS MIND'S AND THE CONGREGATION IN HIS BODY'S EYE HE HAD YET THOUGHT MORE OF ONE SOUL WITH ITS ONE CRIME AND ITS INTOLERABLE BURDEN
7278-246956-0008 THAN ALL THE REST LEOPOLD WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIM AND WHILE HE STROVE TO AVOID ABSORPTION IN A PERSONAL INTEREST HOWEVER JUSTIFIABLE IT WAS OF NECESSITY
7278-246956-0009 OF HIS UTTERANCE AT TIMES INDEED HE FELT AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING TO HIM IMMEDIATELY AND TO HIM ONLY AT OTHERS ALTHOUGH THEN HE SAW HER NO MORE THAN HIM
7278-246956-0010 THAT HE WAS COMFORTING THE SISTER INDIVIDUALLY IN HOLDING OUT TO HER BROTHER THE MIGHTY HOPE OF A RESTORED PURITY AND WHEN ONCE MORE HIS MIND COULD RECEIVE THE MESSAGES
7278-246956-0011 AND THE FIRM MOUTH HAD FORGOTTEN ITSELF INTO A TREMULOUS FORM WHICH THE STILLNESS OF ABSORPTION HAD THERE FOR THE MOMENT FIXED BUT EVEN ALREADY ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT YET READ IT UPON HER
7278-246956-0012 COUNTENANCE A SNAKE HAD BEGUN TO LIFT ITS HEAD FROM THE CHAOTIC SWAMP WHICH RUNS A CREEK AT LEAST INTO EVERY SOUL THE RUDIMENTARY DESOLATION A REMNANT OF THE TIME
7278-246956-0013 WHEN THE WORLD WAS WITHOUT FORM AND VOID AND THE SNAKE SAID WHY THEN DID HE NOT SPEAK LIKE THAT TO MY LEOPOLD WHY DID HE NOT COMFORT HIM WITH SUCH A GOOD HOPE
7278-246956-0014 WELL BECOMING A PRIEST OF THE GENTLE JESUS OR IF HE FANCIED HE MUST SPEAK OF CONFESSION WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK OF IT IN PLAIN HONEST TERMS INSTEAD OF SUGGESTING THE IDEA OF IT SO THAT THE POOR BOY
7278-246956-0015 IMAGINED IT CAME FROM HIS OWN SPIRIT AND MUST THEREFORE BE OBEYED AS THE WILL OF GOD SO SAID THE SNAKE AND BY THE TIME HELEN HAD WALKED HOME WITH HER AUNT THE GLOW HAD SUNK FROM HER SOUL AND
7278-246956-0016 A GRAY WINTRY MIST HAD SETTLED DOWN UPON HER SPIRIT AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT IF THIS LAST HOPE IN GEORGE SHOULD FAIL HER SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE MATTER TO TROUBLE HER ANY FARTHER
7278-246956-0017 SHE WAS A FREE WOMAN AND AS LEOPOLD HAD CHOSEN OTHER COUNSELLORS HAD THUS DECLARED HER UNWORTHY OF CONFIDENCE AND AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED AND DONE FOR LOVE OF HIM
7278-246956-0018 HAD SHE NOT DONE ENOUGH WOULD EVEN HER FATHER REQUIRE MORE OF HER THAN SHE HAD ALREADY DONE AND ENDURED
7278-246956-0019 FROM THE COUCH SHE TOOK NO NOTICE THAT HE HAD GOT UP AND DRESSED WHILE SHE WAS AT CHURCH AND HE KNEW THAT A CLOUD HAD COME BETWEEN THEM AND THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD BORNE AND DONE FOR HIM HE AND HIS SISTER WERE NOW FARTHER APART
7278-246956-0020 FOR THE TIME AT LEAST THAN WHEN OCEANS LAY BETWIXT THEIR BIRTH AND THEIR MEETING AND HE FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING BACK WITH VAGUE LONGING EVEN TO THE TERRIBLE OLD HOUSE OF GLASTON
7278-246956-0021 AND THE SHARING OF THEIR AGONY THEREIN HIS EYES FOLLOWED HER AS SHE WALKED ACROSS TO THE DRESSING ROOM AND THE TEARS ROSE AND FILLED THEM BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND THE SISTER WHO ALL THE TIME OF THE SERMON
7278-246956-0022 HAD BEEN FILLED WITH WAVE UPON WAVE OF WISHING THAT POLDIE COULD HEAR THIS COULD HEAR THAT COULD HAVE SUCH A THOUGHT TO COMFORT HIM SUCH A LOVELY WORD TO DRIVE THE HORROR FROM HIS SOUL
7278-246956-0023 NOW CAST ON HIM A CHILLY GLANCE AND SAID NEVER A WORD OF THE THINGS TO WHICH SHE HAD LISTENED WITH SUCH HEAVINGS OF THE SPIRIT OCEAN FOR SHE FELT WITH AN INSTINCT MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN HER WILL
7278-246956-0024 THAT THEY WOULD BUT STRENGTHEN HIM IN HIS DETERMINATION TO DO WHATEVER THE TEACHER OF THEM MIGHT APPROVE AS SHE REPASSED HIM TO GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM SHE DID INDEED SAY A WORD OF KINDNESS BUT IT WAS IN A FORCED TONE
7278-246956-0025 AND WAS ONLY ABOUT HIS DINNER HIS EYES OVER FLOWED BUT HE SHUT HIS LIPS SO TIGHT THAT HIS MOUTH GREW GRIM WITH DETERMINATION AND NO MORE TEARS CAME TO THE FRIEND WHO JOINED HER AT THE CHURCH DOOR AND IN GEORGE
7278-246956-0026 IN ORDER THEREBY TO ATTAIN TO A BETTER INNOCENCE THAN WITHOUT IT COULD EVER BE THEIRS HOW FAR SHE MISTOOK OR HOW FAR SHE KNEW OR SUSPECTED THAT SHE SPOKE FALSELY I WILL NOT PRETEND TO KNOW BUT ALTHOUGH SHE SPOKE AS SHE DID
7278-246956-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING EITHER IN THE CURATE OR IN THE SERMON THAT HAD QUIETED HER A LITTLE AND SHE WAS LESS CONTEMPTUOUS IN HER CONDEMNATION OF HIM THAN USUAL HAPPILY BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND OTHERS THE CURATE
7278-246956-0028 WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO CRIPPLE THE TRUTH AND BLIND THEIR OWN SOULS
7278-246956-0029 OCCASION TO THE DISHONEST TO CAVIL AND CONDEMN IMAGINE SAINT PAUL HAVING A PREVISION OF HOW HE WOULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND HEEDING IT WHAT WOULD THEN HAVE BECOME OF ALL THOSE HIS MOST MAGNIFICENT OUTBURSTS AND WOULD ANY AMOUNT OF
7278-246956-0030 APOSTOLIC CAREFULNESS HAVE PROTECTED HIM I SUSPECT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MORE VULGAR MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS STILL TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHO LOVES NOT IS BUT TO GIVE HIM THE MORE
7278-246956-0031 PLENTIFUL MATERIAL FOR MISINTERPRETATION LET A MAN HAVE TRUTH IN THE INWARD PARTS AND OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS HEART LET HIS MOUTH SPEAK IF THEN HE SHOULD HAVE GROUND TO FEAR HONEST MISUNDERSTANDING
7278-246956-0032 LET HIM PREACH AGAIN TO ENFORCE THE TRUTH FOR WHICH HE IS JEALOUS AND IF IT SHOULD SEEM TO ANY THAT THE TWO UTTERANCES NEED RECONCILING LET THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE THEM CONSISTENT RECONCILE THEM FOR THEMSELVES
7278-246956-0033 THAT AFTER AN EARLY BREAKFAST HE HAD MOUNTED HELEN'S MARE AND SET OUT TO CALL ON MISTER HOOKER
7278-246956-0034 THE GROOM TOOK HIS HORSE IN THE STREET AND HE CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM HELEN HASTENED TO MEET HIM WELL GEORGE SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY OH IT'S ALL RIGHT WILL BE AT LEAST I AM SURE
7278-246956-0035 I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT IN THE GARDEN AFTER DINNER AUNT HAS THE GOOD SENSE NEVER TO INTERRUPT US THERE HE ADDED I'LL JUST RUN AND SHOW MYSELF TO LEOPOLD HE MUST NOT SUSPECT THAT I AM OF YOUR PARTY AND

1723-141149-0002 WE KEPT CLOSE TO THE FUEGIAN SHORE BUT THE OUTLINE OF THE RUGGED INHOSPITABLE STATENLAND WAS VISIBLE AMIDST THE CLOUDS IN THE AFTERNOON WE ANCHORED IN THE BAY OF GOOD SUCCESS WHILE ENTERING WE WERE SALUTED IN A MANNER BECOMING THE INHABITANTS OF THIS SAVAGE LAND
1723-141149-0003 A GROUP OF FUEGIANS PARTLY CONCEALED BY THE ENTANGLED FOREST WERE PERCHED ON A WILD POINT OVERHANGING THE SEA AND AS WE PASSED BY THEY SPRANG UP AND WAVING THEIR TATTERED CLOAKS SENT FORTH A LOUD AND SONOROUS SHOUT THE SAVAGES FOLLOWED THE SHIP

1723-141149-0010 AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
1723-141149-0011 HIS FACE WAS CROSSED BY TWO BROAD TRANSVERSE BARS ONE PAINTED BRIGHT RED REACHED FROM EAR TO EAR AND INCLUDED THE UPPER LIP THE OTHER WHITE LIKE CHALK EXTENDED ABOVE AND PARALLEL TO THE FIRST SO THAT EVEN HIS EYELIDS WERE THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0012 THE OTHER TWO MEN WERE ORNAMENTED BY STREAKS OF BLACK POWDER MADE OF CHARCOAL THE PARTY ALTOGETHER CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE DEVILS WHICH COME ON THE STAGE IN PLAYS LIKE DER FREISCHUTZ THEIR VERY ATTITUDES WERE ABJECT
1723-141149-0013 AND THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR COUNTENANCES DISTRUSTFUL SURPRISED AND STARTLED AFTER WE HAD PRESENTED THEM WITH SOME SCARLET CLOTH WHICH THEY IMMEDIATELY TIED ROUND THEIR NECKS THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS THIS WAS SHOWN BY THE OLD MAN PATTING OUR BREASTS
1723-141149-0014 AS PEOPLE DO WHEN FEEDING CHICKENS I WALKED WITH THE OLD MAN AND THIS DEMONSTRATION OF FRIENDSHIP WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS CONCLUDED BY THREE HARD SLAPS WHICH WERE GIVEN ME ON THE BREAST AND BACK AT THE SAME TIME HE THEN BARED HIS BOSOM FOR ME TO RETURN THE COMPLIMENT WHICH BEING DONE
1723-141149-0015 HE SEEMED HIGHLY PLEASED THE LANGUAGE OF THESE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO OUR NOTIONS SCARCELY DESERVES TO BE CALLED ARTICULATE CAPTAIN COOK HAS COMPARED IT TO A MAN CLEARING HIS THROAT BUT CERTAINLY NO EUROPEAN EVER CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH SO MANY HOARSE GUTTURAL AND CLICKING SOUNDS
1723-141149-0016 THEY ARE EXCELLENT MIMICS AS OFTEN AS WE COUGHED OR YAWNED OR MADE ANY ODD MOTION THEY IMMEDIATELY IMITATED US SOME OF OUR PARTY BEGAN TO SQUINT AND LOOK AWRY BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG FUEGIANS WHOSE WHOLE FACE WAS PAINTED BLACK EXCEPTING A WHITE BAND ACROSS HIS EYES
1723-141149-0017 SUCCEEDED IN MAKING FAR MORE HIDEOUS GRIMACES THEY COULD REPEAT WITH PERFECT CORRECTNESS EACH WORD IN ANY SENTENCE WE ADDRESSED THEM AND THEY REMEMBERED SUCH WORDS FOR SOME TIME YET WE EUROPEANS ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISTINGUISH APART THE SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
1723-141149-0018 WHICH OF US FOR INSTANCE COULD FOLLOW AN AMERICAN INDIAN THROUGH A SENTENCE OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS ALL SAVAGES APPEAR TO POSSESS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THIS POWER OF MIMICRY I WAS TOLD ALMOST IN THE SAME WORDS OF THE SAME LUDICROUS HABIT AMONG THE CAFFRES
1723-141149-0019 THE AUSTRALIANS LIKEWISE HAVE LONG BEEN NOTORIOUS FOR BEING ABLE TO IMITATE AND DESCRIBE THE GAIT OF ANY MAN SO THAT HE MAY BE RECOGNIZED HOW CAN THIS FACULTY BE EXPLAINED IS IT A CONSEQUENCE OF THE MORE PRACTISED HABITS OF PERCEPTION AND KEENER SENSES COMMON TO ALL MEN IN A SAVAGE STATE
1723-141149-0020 AS COMPARED WITH THOSE LONG CIVILIZED WHEN A SONG WAS STRUCK UP BY OUR PARTY I THOUGHT THE FUEGIANS WOULD HAVE FALLEN DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT WITH EQUAL SURPRISE THEY VIEWED OUR DANCING BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHEN ASKED HAD NO OBJECTION TO A LITTLE WALTZING
1723-141149-0021 LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO EUROPEANS AS THEY APPEARED TO BE YET THEY KNEW AND DREADED OUR FIRE ARMS NOTHING WOULD TEMPT THEM TO TAKE A GUN IN THEIR HANDS THEY BEGGED FOR KNIVES CALLING THEM BY THE SPANISH WORD
1723-141149-0022 THEY EXPLAINED ALSO WHAT THEY WANTED BY ACTING AS IF THEY HAD A PIECE OF BLUBBER IN THEIR MOUTH AND THEN PRETENDING TO CUT INSTEAD OF TEAR IT I HAVE NOT AS YET NOTICED THE FUEGIANS WHOM WE HAD ON BOARD
1723-141149-0023 DURING THE FORMER VOYAGE OF THE ADVENTURE AND BEAGLE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY CAPTAIN FITZ ROY SEIZED ON A PARTY OF NATIVES AS HOSTAGES FOR THE LOSS OF A BOAT WHICH HAD BEEN STOLEN TO THE GREAT JEOPARDY OF A PARTY EMPLOYED ON THE SURVEY
1723-141149-0024 AND SOME OF THESE NATIVES AS WELL AS A CHILD WHOM HE BOUGHT FOR A PEARL BUTTON HE TOOK WITH HIM TO ENGLAND DETERMINING TO EDUCATE THEM AND INSTRUCT THEM IN RELIGION AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO SETTLE THESE NATIVES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY
1723-141149-0025 WAS ONE CHIEF INDUCEMENT TO CAPTAIN FITZ ROY TO UNDERTAKE OUR PRESENT VOYAGE AND BEFORE THE ADMIRALTY HAD RESOLVED TO SEND OUT THIS EXPEDITION CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAD GENEROUSLY CHARTERED A VESSEL AND WOULD HIMSELF HAVE TAKEN THEM BACK THE NATIVES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A MISSIONARY
1723-141149-0026 R MATTHEWS OF WHOM AND OF THE NATIVES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS PUBLISHED A FULL AND EXCELLENT ACCOUNT TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM DIED IN ENGLAND OF THE SMALL POX A BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL WERE ORIGINALLY TAKEN AND WE HAD NOW ON BOARD
1723-141149-0027 YORK MINSTER JEMMY BUTTON WHOSE NAME EXPRESSES HIS PURCHASE MONEY AND FUEGIA BASKET YORK MINSTER WAS A FULL GROWN SHORT THICK POWERFUL MAN HIS DISPOSITION WAS RESERVED TACITURN MOROSE
1723-141149-0028 AND WHEN EXCITED VIOLENTLY PASSIONATE HIS AFFECTIONS WERE VERY STRONG TOWARDS A FEW FRIENDS ON BOARD HIS INTELLECT GOOD JEMMY BUTTON WAS A UNIVERSAL FAVOURITE BUT LIKEWISE PASSIONATE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AT ONCE SHOWED HIS NICE DISPOSITION
1723-141149-0029 HE WAS MERRY AND OFTEN LAUGHED AND WAS REMARKABLY SYMPATHETIC WITH ANY ONE IN PAIN WHEN THE WATER WAS ROUGH I WAS OFTEN A LITTLE SEA SICK AND HE USED TO COME TO ME AND SAY IN A PLAINTIVE VOICE POOR POOR FELLOW BUT THE NOTION AFTER HIS AQUATIC LIFE
1723-141149-0030 OF A MAN BEING SEA SICK WAS TOO LUDICROUS AND HE WAS GENERALLY OBLIGED TO TURN ON ONE SIDE TO HIDE A SMILE OR LAUGH
1723-141149-0031 POOR POOR FELLOW HE WAS OF A PATRIOTIC DISPOSITION AND HE LIKED TO PRAISE HIS OWN TRIBE AND COUNTRY
1723-141149-0032 AND HE ABUSED ALL THE OTHER TRIBES HE STOUTLY DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO DEVIL IN HIS LAND JEMMY WAS SHORT THICK AND FAT BUT VAIN OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE USED ALWAYS TO WEAR GLOVES
1723-141149-0033 HIS HAIR WAS NEATLY CUT AND HE WAS DISTRESSED IF HIS WELL POLISHED SHOES WERE DIRTIED HE WAS FOND OF ADMIRING HIMSELF IN A LOOKING GLASS AND A MERRY FACED LITTLE INDIAN BOY FROM THE RIO NEGRO WHOM WE HAD FOR SOME MONTHS ON BOARD SOON PERCEIVED THIS AND USED TO MOCK HIM
1723-141149-0034 TOO MUCH SKYLARK IT SEEMS YET WONDERFUL TO ME WHEN I THINK OVER ALL HIS MANY GOOD QUALITIES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF THE SAME RACE AND DOUBTLESS PARTAKEN OF THE SAME CHARACTER WITH THE MISERABLE DEGRADED SAVAGES WHOM WE FIRST MET HERE LASTLY
1723-141149-0035 FUEGIA BASKET WAS A NICE MODEST RESERVED YOUNG GIRL WITH A RATHER PLEASING BUT SOMETIMES SULLEN EXPRESSION AND VERY QUICK IN LEARNING ANYTHING ESPECIALLY LANGUAGES THIS SHE SHOWED IN PICKING UP SOME PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH
1723-141149-0036 ALTHOUGH ALL THREE COULD BOTH SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL OF ENGLISH IT WAS SINGULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MUCH INFORMATION FROM THEM CONCERNING THE HABITS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS WAS PARTLY OWING TO THEIR APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATIVE
1723-141149-0037 EVERY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN KNOWS HOW SELDOM ONE CAN GET AN ANSWER EVEN TO SO SIMPLE A QUESTION AS WHETHER A THING IS BLACK OR WHITE THE IDEA OF BLACK OR WHITE SEEMS ALTERNATELY TO FILL THEIR MINDS SO IT WAS WITH THESE FUEGIANS
1723-141149-0038 AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
1723-141149-0039 AND JEMMY WHEN HE HAD ANY LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE OFFICER ON WATCH WOULD SAY ME SEE SHIP ME NO TELL IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE CONDUCT OF THE SAVAGES WHEN WE LANDED TOWARDS JEMMY BUTTON
1723-141149-0040 THEY IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND HELD MUCH CONVERSATION ONE WITH ANOTHER ON THE SUBJECT THE OLD MAN ADDRESSED A LONG HARANGUE TO JEMMY WHICH IT SEEMS WAS TO INVITE HIM TO STAY WITH THEM
1723-141149-0041 BUT JEMMY UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE OF THEIR LANGUAGE AND WAS MOREOVER THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHEN YORK MINSTER AFTERWARDS CAME ON SHORE THEY NOTICED HIM IN THE SAME WAY AND TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO SHAVE YET HE HAD NOT TWENTY DWARF HAIRS ON HIS FACE WHILST WE ALL WORE OUR UNTRIMMED BEARDS
1723-141149-0042 THEY EXAMINED THE COLOUR OF HIS SKIN AND COMPARED IT WITH OURS ONE OF OUR ARMS BEING BARED THEY EXPRESSED THE LIVELIEST SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION AT ITS WHITENESS JUST IN THE SAME WAY IN WHICH I HAVE SEEN THE OURANGOUTANG DO AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
1723-141149-0043 WE THOUGHT THAT THEY MISTOOK TWO OR THREE OF THE OFFICERS WHO WERE RATHER SHORTER AND FAIRER THOUGH ADORNED WITH LARGE BEARDS FOR THE LADIES OF OUR PARTY
1723-141149-0044 THAT I DARE SAY HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE HANDSOMEST MAN IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO AFTER OUR FIRST FEELING OF GRAVE ASTONISHMENT WAS OVER NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE ODD MIXTURE OF SURPRISE AND IMITATION WHICH THESE SAVAGES EVERY MOMENT EXHIBITED
1723-141149-0045 THE NEXT DAY I ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE SOME WAY INTO THE COUNTRY TIERRA DEL FUEGO MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A MOUNTAINOUS LAND PARTLY SUBMERGED IN THE SEA SO THAT DEEP INLETS AND BAYS OCCUPY THE PLACE WHERE VALLEYS SHOULD EXIST
1723-141149-0046 THE MOUNTAIN SIDES EXCEPT ON THE EXPOSED WESTERN COAST ARE COVERED FROM THE WATER'S EDGE UPWARDS BY ONE GREAT FOREST
1723-141149-0047 AND ARE SUCCEEDED BY A BAND OF PEAT WITH MINUTE ALPINE PLANTS AND THIS AGAIN IS SUCCEEDED BY THE LINE OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN KING IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN DESCENDS TO BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND AND FOUR THOUSAND FEET
1723-141149-0048 IS MOST RARE I RECOLLECT ONLY ONE LITTLE FLAT PIECE NEAR PORT FAMINE AND ANOTHER OF RATHER LARGER EXTENT NEAR GOEREE ROAD IN BOTH PLACES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE THE SURFACE IS COVERED BY A THICK BED OF SWAMPY PEAT EVEN WITHIN THE FOREST
1723-141149-0049 THE GROUND IS CONCEALED BY A MASS OF SLOWLY PUTREFYING VEGETABLE MATTER WHICH FROM BEING SOAKED WITH WATER YIELDS TO THE FOOT FINDING IT NEARLY HOPELESS TO PUSH MY WAY THROUGH THE WOOD I FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT
1723-141149-0050 AT FIRST FROM THE WATERFALLS AND NUMBER OF DEAD TREES I COULD HARDLY CRAWL ALONG BUT THE BED OF THE STREAM SOON BECAME A LITTLE MORE OPEN FROM THE FLOODS HAVING SWEPT THE SIDES I CONTINUED SLOWLY TO ADVANCE FOR AN HOUR ALONG THE BROKEN AND ROCKY BANKS
1723-141149-0051 AND WAS AMPLY REPAID BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE THE GLOOMY DEPTH OF THE RAVINE WELL ACCORDED WITH THE UNIVERSAL SIGNS OF VIOLENCE ON EVERY SIDE WERE LYING IRREGULAR MASSES OF ROCK AND TORN UP TREES OTHER TREES THOUGH STILL ERECT
1723-141149-0052 WERE DECAYED TO THE HEART AND READY TO FALL THE ENTANGLED MASS OF THE THRIVING AND THE FALLEN REMINDED ME OF THE FORESTS WITHIN THE TROPICS YET THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE FOR IN THESE STILL SOLITUDES DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE SEEMED THE PREDOMINANT SPIRIT
1723-141149-0053 HAD CLEARED A STRAIGHT SPACE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BY THIS ROAD I ASCENDED TO A CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION AND OBTAINED A GOOD VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING WOODS THE TREES ALL BELONG TO ONE KIND THE FAGUS BETULOIDES
1723-141149-0054 FOR THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER SPECIES OF FAGUS AND OF THE WINTER'S BARK IS QUITE INCONSIDERABLE THIS BEECH KEEPS ITS LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT ITS FOLIAGE IS OF A PECULIAR BROWNISH GREEN COLOUR WITH A TINGE OF YELLOW AS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE IS THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0055 IT HAS A SOMBRE DULL APPEARANCE NOR IS IT OFTEN ENLIVENED BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN
1723-141149-0056 ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH WHICH CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS CALLED AFTER SIR J BANKS IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS DISASTROUS EXCURSION WHICH PROVED FATAL TO TWO MEN OF HIS PARTY AND NEARLY SO TO DOCTOR SOLANDER THE SNOW STORM WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
1723-141149-0057 WE FOLLOWED THE SAME WATER COURSE AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY TILL IT DWINDLED AWAY AND WE WERE THEN COMPELLED TO CRAWL BLINDLY AMONG THE TREES THESE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE ELEVATION AND OF THE IMPETUOUS WINDS WERE LOW THICK AND CROOKED
1723-141149-0058 AT LENGTH WE REACHED THAT WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED LIKE A CARPET OF FINE GREEN TURF BUT WHICH TO OUR VEXATION TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPACT MASS OF LITTLE BEECH TREES ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET HIGH
1723-141149-0059 THEY WERE AS THICK TOGETHER AS BOX IN THE BORDER OF A GARDEN AND WE WERE OBLIGED TO STRUGGLE OVER THE FLAT BUT TREACHEROUS SURFACE
1723-141149-0060 A RIDGE CONNECTED THIS HILL WITH ANOTHER DISTANT SOME MILES AND MORE LOFTY SO THAT PATCHES OF SNOW WERE LYING ON IT AS THE DAY WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED I DETERMINED TO WALK THERE AND COLLECT PLANTS ALONG THE ROAD
1723-141149-0061 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HARD WORK HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A WELL BEATEN AND STRAIGHT PATH MADE BY THE GUANACOS FOR THESE ANIMALS LIKE SHEEP ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SAME LINE WHEN WE REACHED THE HILL WE FOUND IT THE HIGHEST IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
1723-141149-0062 AND THE WATERS FLOWED TO THE SEA IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WE OBTAINED A WIDE VIEW OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY TO THE NORTH A SWAMPY MOORLAND EXTENDED
1723-141149-0063 WELL BECOMING TIERRA DEL FUEGO THERE WAS A DEGREE OF MYSTERIOUS GRANDEUR IN MOUNTAIN BEHIND MOUNTAIN WITH THE DEEP INTERVENING VALLEYS ALL COVERED BY ONE THICK DUSKY MASS OF FOREST THE ATMOSPHERE LIKEWISE IN THIS CLIMATE
1723-141149-0064 WHERE GALE SUCCEEDS GALE WITH RAIN HAIL AND SLEET SEEMS BLACKER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN LOOKING DUE SOUTHWARD FROM PORT FAMINE THE DISTANT CHANNELS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS APPEARED FROM THEIR GLOOMINESS TO LEAD BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THIS WORLD
1723-141149-0065 AND ON THE SUCCEEDING DAY FAVOURED TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE BY A FINE EASTERLY BREEZE WE CLOSED IN WITH THE BARNEVELTS AND RUNNING PAST CAPE DECEIT WITH ITS STONY PEAKS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK DOUBLED THE WEATHER BEATEN CAPE HORN THE EVENING WAS CALM AND BRIGHT
1723-141149-0066 AND WE ENJOYED A FINE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING ISLES CAPE HORN HOWEVER DEMANDED HIS TRIBUTE AND BEFORE NIGHT SENT US A GALE OF WIND DIRECTLY IN OUR TEETH WE STOOD OUT TO SEA AND ON THE SECOND DAY AGAIN MADE THE LAND
1723-141149-0067 WHEN WE SAW ON OUR WEATHER BOW THIS NOTORIOUS PROMONTORY IN ITS PROPER FORM VEILED IN A MIST AND ITS DIM OUTLINE SURROUNDED BY A STORM OF WIND AND WATER GREAT BLACK CLOUDS WERE ROLLING ACROSS THE HEAVENS AND SQUALLS OF RAIN WITH HAIL
1723-141149-0068 THAT THE CAPTAIN DETERMINED TO RUN INTO WIGWAM COVE THIS IS A SNUG LITTLE HARBOUR NOT FAR FROM CAPE HORN AND HERE AT CHRISTMAS EVE WE ANCHORED IN SMOOTH WATER THE ONLY THING WHICH REMINDED US OF THE GALE OUTSIDE
1723-141149-0069 WAS EVERY NOW AND THEN A PUFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS WHICH MADE THE SHIP SURGE AT HER ANCHORS
1723-141149-0070 RISES TO THE HEIGHT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FEET THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS ALL CONSIST OF CONICAL MASSES OF GREENSTONE ASSOCIATED SOMETIMES WITH LESS REGULAR HILLS OF BAKED AND ALTERED CLAY SLATE THIS PART OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO
1723-141149-0071 MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE EXTREMITY OF THE SUBMERGED CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE COVE TAKES ITS NAME OF WIGWAM FROM SOME OF THE FUEGIAN HABITATIONS BUT EVERY BAY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MIGHT BE SO CALLED WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY THE INHABITANTS
1723-141149-0072 LIVING CHIEFLY UPON SHELL FISH ARE OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO CHANGE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE BUT THEY RETURN AT INTERVALS TO THE SAME SPOTS AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE PILES OF OLD SHELLS WHICH MUST OFTEN AMOUNT TO MANY TONS IN FREIGHT
1723-141149-0073 THE FUEGIAN WIGWAM RESEMBLES IN SIZE AND DIMENSIONS A HAYCOCK IT MERELY CONSISTS OF A FEW BROKEN BRANCHES STUCK IN THE GROUND AND VERY IMPERFECTLY THATCHED ON ONE SIDE WITH A FEW TUFTS OF GRASS AND RUSHES THE WHOLE CANNOT BE THE WORK OF AN HOUR
1723-141149-0074 AND IT IS ONLY USED FOR A FEW DAYS AT GOEREE ROADS I SAW A PLACE WHERE ONE OF THESE NAKED MEN HAD SLEPT WHICH ABSOLUTELY OFFERED NO MORE COVER THAN THE FORM OF A HARE THE MAN WAS EVIDENTLY LIVING BY HIMSELF
1723-141149-0075 ON THE WEST COAST HOWEVER THE WIGWAMS ARE RATHER BETTER FOR THEY ARE COVERED WITH SEAL SKINS WE WERE DETAINED HERE SEVERAL DAYS BY THE BAD WEATHER THE CLIMATE IS CERTAINLY WRETCHED THE SUMMER SOLSTICE WAS NOW PASSED
1723-141149-0076 YET EVERY DAY SNOW FELL ON THE HILLS AND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WAS RAIN ACCOMPANIED BY SLEET THE THERMOMETER GENERALLY STOOD
1723-141149-0077 FROM THE DAMP AND BOISTEROUS STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
1723-141149-0078 ONE FANCIED THE CLIMATE EVEN WORSE THAN IT REALLY WAS WHILE GOING ONE DAY ON SHORE NEAR WOLLASTON ISLAND WE PULLED ALONGSIDE A CANOE WITH SIX FUEGIANS THESE WERE THE MOST ABJECT AND MISERABLE CREATURES I ANYWHERE BEHELD
1723-141149-0079 ON THE EAST COAST THE NATIVES AS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE GUANACO CLOAKS AND ON THE WEST THEY POSSESS SEAL SKINS AMONGST THESE CENTRAL TRIBES THE MEN GENERALLY HAVE AN OTTER SKIN OR SOME SMALL SCRAP ABOUT AS LARGE AS A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
1723-141149-0080 WHICH IS BARELY SUFFICIENT TO COVER THEIR BACKS AS LOW DOWN AS THEIR LOINS IT IS LACED ACROSS THE BREAST BY STRINGS AND ACCORDING AS THE WIND BLOWS IT IS SHIFTED FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT THESE FUEGIANS IN THE CANOE WERE QUITE NAKED AND EVEN ONE FULL GROWN WOMAN WAS ABSOLUTELY SO
1723-141149-0081 IT WAS RAINING HEAVILY AND THE FRESH WATER TOGETHER WITH THE SPRAY TRICKLED DOWN HER BODY IN ANOTHER HARBOUR NOT FAR DISTANT A WOMAN WHO WAS SUCKLING A RECENTLY BORN CHILD CAME ONE DAY ALONGSIDE THE VESSEL AND REMAINED THERE OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY
1723-141149-0082 THEIR VOICES DISCORDANT AND THEIR GESTURES VIOLENT VIEWING SUCH MEN ONE CAN HARDLY MAKE ONE'S SELF BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE FELLOW CREATURES AND INHABITANTS OF THE SAME WORLD IT IS A COMMON SUBJECT OF CONJECTURE WHAT PLEASURE IN LIFE SOME OF THE LOWER ANIMALS CAN ENJOY
1723-141149-0083 HOW MUCH MORE REASONABLY THE SAME QUESTION MAY BE ASKED WITH RESPECT TO THESE BARBARIANS AT NIGHT FIVE OR SIX HUMAN BEINGS NAKED AND SCARCELY PROTECTED FROM THE WIND AND RAIN OF THIS TEMPESTUOUS CLIMATE SLEEP ON THE WET GROUND COILED UP LIKE ANIMALS
1723-141149-0084 WHENEVER IT IS LOW WATER WINTER OR SUMMER NIGHT OR DAY THEY MUST RISE TO PICK SHELL FISH FROM THE ROCKS AND THE WOMEN EITHER DIVE TO COLLECT SEA EGGS OR SIT PATIENTLY IN THEIR CANOES AND WITH A BAITED HAIR LINE WITHOUT ANY HOOK JERK OUT LITTLE FISH
1723-141149-0085 IF A SEAL IS KILLED OR THE FLOATING CARCASS OF A PUTRID WHALE IS DISCOVERED IT IS A FEAST AND SUCH MISERABLE FOOD IS ASSISTED BY A FEW TASTELESS BERRIES AND FUNGI THEY OFTEN SUFFER FROM FAMINE
1723-141149-0086 I HEARD MISTER LOW A SEALING MASTER INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE NATIVES OF THIS COUNTRY GIVE A CURIOUS ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF A PARTY OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NATIVES ON THE WEST COAST WHO WERE VERY THIN AND IN GREAT DISTRESS
1723-141149-0087 A SUCCESSION OF GALES PREVENTED THE WOMEN FROM GETTING SHELL FISH ON THE ROCKS AND THEY COULD NOT GO OUT IN THEIR CANOES TO CATCH SEAL A SMALL PARTY OF THESE MEN ONE MORNING SET OUT AND THE OTHER INDIANS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING A FOUR DAYS JOURNEY FOR FOOD
1723-141149-0088 AS SOON AS THE BLUBBER WAS BROUGHT INTO A WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CUT OFF THIN SLICES AND MUTTERING OVER THEM BROILED THEM FOR A MINUTE
1723-141149-0089 WHO DURING THIS TIME PRESERVED A PROFOUND SILENCE MISTER LOW BELIEVES THAT WHENEVER A WHALE IS CAST ON SHORE THE NATIVES BURY LARGE PIECES OF IT IN THE SAND AS A RESOURCE IN TIME OF FAMINE AND A NATIVE BOY WHOM HE HAD ON BOARD ONCE FOUND A STOCK THUS BURIED
1723-141149-0090 THE DIFFERENT TRIBES WHEN AT WAR ARE CANNIBALS FROM THE CONCURRENT BUT QUITE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF THE BOY TAKEN BY MISTER LOW AND OF JEMMY BUTTON IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WHEN PRESSED IN WINTER BY HUNGER
1723-141149-0091 THEY KILL AND DEVOUR THEIR OLD WOMEN BEFORE THEY KILL THEIR DOGS THE BOY BEING ASKED BY MISTER LOW WHY THEY DID THIS ANSWERED DOGGIES CATCH OTTERS OLD WOMEN NO THIS BOY DESCRIBED THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE KILLED BY BEING HELD OVER SMOKE AND THUS CHOKED
1723-141149-0092 HE IMITATED THEIR SCREAMS AS A JOKE AND DESCRIBED THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BEST TO EAT HORRID AS SUCH A DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES MUST BE THE FEARS OF THE OLD WOMEN WHEN HUNGER BEGINS TO PRESS ARE MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF
1723-141149-0093 BUT THAT THEY ARE PURSUED BY THE MEN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE AT THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY COULD NEVER ASCERTAIN THAT THE FUEGIANS HAVE ANY DISTINCT BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR DEAD IN CAVES
1723-141149-0094 AND SOMETIMES IN THE MOUNTAIN FORESTS WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CEREMONIES THEY PERFORM JEMMY BUTTON WOULD NOT EAT LAND BIRDS BECAUSE EAT DEAD MEN THEY ARE UNWILLING EVEN TO MENTION THEIR DEAD FRIENDS WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY PERFORM ANY SORT OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP
1723-141149-0095 THOUGH PERHAPS THE MUTTERING OF THE OLD MAN BEFORE HE DISTRIBUTED THE PUTRID BLUBBER TO HIS FAMISHED PARTY MAY BE OF THIS NATURE EACH FAMILY OR TRIBE HAS A WIZARD OR CONJURING DOCTOR WHOSE OFFICE WE COULD NEVER CLEARLY ASCERTAIN JEMMY BELIEVED IN DREAMS
1723-141149-0096 THOUGH NOT AS I HAVE SAID IN THE DEVIL I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FUEGIANS WERE MUCH MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN SOME OF THE SAILORS FOR AN OLD QUARTERMASTER FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE SUCCESSIVE HEAVY GALES WHICH WE ENCOUNTERED OFF CAPE HORN WERE CAUSED BY OUR HAVING THE FUEGIANS ON BOARD
1723-141149-0097 THE NEAREST APPROACH TO A RELIGIOUS FEELING WHICH I HEARD OF WAS SHOWN BY YORK MINSTER
1723-141149-0098 IN A WILD AND EXCITED MANNER HE ALSO RELATED THAT HIS BROTHER ONE DAY WHILST RETURNING TO PICK UP SOME DEAD BIRDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT ON THE COAST OBSERVED SOME FEATHERS BLOWN BY THE WIND HIS BROTHER SAID YORK IMITATING HIS MANNER WHAT THAT
1723-141149-0099 AND CRAWLING ONWARDS HE PEEPED OVER THE CLIFF AND SAW WILD MAN PICKING HIS BIRDS HE CRAWLED A LITTLE NEARER AND THEN HURLED DOWN A GREAT STONE AND KILLED HIM YORK DECLARED FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS STORMS RAGED AND MUCH RAIN AND SNOW FELL
1723-141149-0100 AS FAR AS WE COULD MAKE OUT HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER THE ELEMENTS THEMSELVES AS THE AVENGING AGENTS IT IS EVIDENT IN THIS CASE HOW NATURALLY IN A RACE A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED IN CULTURE THE ELEMENTS WOULD BECOME PERSONIFIED WHAT THE BAD WILD MEN WERE
1723-141149-0101 HAS ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME MOST MYSTERIOUS FROM WHAT YORK SAID WHEN WE FOUND THE PLACE LIKE THE FORM OF A HARE WHERE A SINGLE MAN HAD SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE
1723-141149-0102 BUT OTHER OBSCURE SPEECHES MADE ME DOUBT THIS I HAVE SOMETIMES IMAGINED THAT THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION WAS THAT THEY WERE INSANE THE DIFFERENT TRIBES HAVE NO GOVERNMENT OR CHIEF YET EACH IS SURROUNDED BY OTHER HOSTILE TRIBES SPEAKING DIFFERENT DIALECTS
1723-141149-0103 AND SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER ONLY BY A DESERTED BORDER OR NEUTRAL TERRITORY THE CAUSE OF THEIR WARFARE APPEARS TO BE THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE THEIR COUNTRY IS A BROKEN MASS OF WILD ROCKS LOFTY HILLS AND USELESS FORESTS
1723-141149-0104 AND THESE ARE VIEWED THROUGH MISTS AND ENDLESS STORMS THE HABITABLE LAND IS REDUCED TO THE STONES ON THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF FOOD THEY ARE COMPELLED UNCEASINGLY TO WANDER FROM SPOT TO SPOT AND SO STEEP IS THE COAST THAT THEY CAN ONLY MOVE ABOUT IN THEIR WRETCHED CANOES
1723-141149-0105 THEY CANNOT KNOW THE FEELING OF HAVING A HOME AND STILL LESS THAT OF DOMESTIC AFFECTION FOR THE HUSBAND IS TO THE WIFE A BRUTAL MASTER TO A LABORIOUS SLAVE WAS A MORE HORRID DEED EVER PERPETRATED THAN THAT WITNESSED ON THE WEST COAST BY BYRON
1723-141149-0106 WHO SAW A WRETCHED MOTHER PICK UP HER BLEEDING DYING INFANT BOY WHOM HER HUSBAND HAD MERCILESSLY DASHED ON THE STONES FOR DROPPING A BASKET OF SEA EGGS HOW LITTLE CAN THE HIGHER POWERS OF THE MIND BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY WHAT IS THERE FOR IMAGINATION TO PICTURE
1723-141149-0107 FOR REASON TO COMPARE OR JUDGMENT TO DECIDE UPON TO KNOCK A LIMPET FROM THE ROCK DOES NOT REQUIRE EVEN CUNNING THAT LOWEST POWER OF THE MIND THEIR SKILL IN SOME RESPECTS MAY BE COMPARED TO THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS FOR IT IS NOT IMPROVED BY EXPERIENCE
1723-141149-0108 THE CANOE THEIR MOST INGENIOUS WORK POOR AS IT IS HAS REMAINED THE SAME AS WE KNOW FROM DRAKE FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WHILST BEHOLDING THESE SAVAGES ONE ASKS WHENCE HAVE THEY COME WHAT COULD HAVE TEMPTED
1723-141149-0109 OR WHAT CHANGE COMPELLED A TRIBE OF MEN TO LEAVE THE FINE REGIONS OF THE NORTH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE CORDILLERA OR BACKBONE OF AMERICA TO INVENT AND BUILD CANOES WHICH ARE NOT USED BY THE TRIBES OF CHILE PERU AND BRAZIL
1723-141149-0110 AND THEN TO ENTER ON ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE GLOBE ALTHOUGH SUCH REFLECTIONS MUST AT FIRST SEIZE ON THE MIND YET WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTLY ERRONEOUS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEGIANS DECREASE IN NUMBER
1723-141149-0111 THEREFORE WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT THEY ENJOY A SUFFICIENT SHARE OF HAPPINESS OF WHATEVER KIND IT MAY BE TO RENDER LIFE WORTH HAVING
2159-179156-0000 HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
2159-179156-0001 THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
2159-179156-0002 ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNTS EVER GIVEN IS THAT OF DOCTOR JAMES R COCKE A HYPNOTIST HIMSELF WHO SUBMITTED TO BEING OPERATED UPON BY A PROFESSIONAL MAGNETIZER
2159-179156-0003 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
2159-179156-0004 BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
2159-179156-0005 WHICH HE SUPPOSED CAME FROM THE HAND OF THE OPERATOR AFTERWARD HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SENSATION WAS PURELY IMAGINARY ON HIS PART THEN HE SAYS A SENSATION AKIN TO FEAR CAME OVER ME
2159-179156-0006 THE OPERATOR SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MY HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY AND I FELT A SENSATION OF TERROR
2159-179156-0007 HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
2159-179156-0008 YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
2159-179156-0009 THE FEELING OF NOT WISHING TO OPEN MY EYES WAS NOT BASED UPON ANY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE OPERATOR I HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM IN ANY WAY BUT BE IT UNDERSTOOD I FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL ME
2159-179156-0010 THEN HE STROKED THE ARM AND SAID IT WAS GROWING NUMB HE SAID YOU HAVE NO FEELING IN IT HAVE YOU DOCTOR COCKE GOES ON I SAID NO AND I KNEW THAT I SAID NO
2159-179156-0011 THE OPERATOR WENT ON PRICKING THE ARM WITH A PIN AND THOUGH DOCTOR COCKE FELT THE PAIN HE SAID HE DID NOT FEEL IT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SENSATION OF TERROR INCREASED I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF MY BODY AT ALL HE SAYS FURTHER ON
2159-179156-0012 BUT I WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO CONTRADICTORY ELEMENTS WITHIN ME I KNEW THAT MY BODY EXISTED BUT COULD NOT PROVE IT TO MYSELF I KNEW THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE OPERATOR WERE IN A MEASURE UNTRUE
2159-179156-0013 I OBEYED THEM VOLUNTARILY AND INVOLUNTARILY THIS IS THE LAST REMEMBRANCE THAT I HAVE OF THAT HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE AFTER THIS HOWEVER THE OPERATOR CAUSED THE DOCTOR TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH HE LEARNED OF FROM HIS FRIENDS AFTER THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER
2159-179156-0014 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
2159-179156-0015 BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
2159-179156-0016 WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
2159-179156-0017 IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
2159-179156-0018 HE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN A CONDITION OF SELF INDUCED HYPNOTISM IN WHICH THEIR SUBJECTIVE FACULTIES WERE SO EXALTED AS TO SUPERSEDE THEIR OBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS MUSIC WAS NO LONGER TO THEM A SUCCESSION OF PLEASING SOUNDS
2159-179156-0019 BUT THE EMBODIMENT OF A DRAMA IN WHICH THEY BECAME SO WRAPPED UP THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE MECHANICAL AND EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE MUSIC AND LIVED COMPLETELY IN A FAIRY WORLD OF DREAM
2159-179156-0020 THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
2159-179156-0021 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0022 AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
2159-179156-0023 THE STATE OF MIND BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST REALISTIC AND VIVID MANNER POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE RIDE OF TAM O'SHANTER WHICH HE HAD SEEN YEARS BEFORE THE PICTURE
2159-179156-0024 SOON BECAME REAL TO HIM AND HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING PART IN A WILD CHASE NOT AS WITCH DEVIL OR TAM EVEN BUT IN SOME WAY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY PART OF THE SCENE BEING OF IT
2159-179156-0025 AND YET PLAYING THE PART OF SPECTATOR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN DREAMS DOCTOR WARTHIN TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AGAIN THIS TIME ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT SO EMOTIONAL AND WAS HYPNOTIZED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY
2159-179156-0026 THIS SUBJECT DID NOT PASS INTO SUCH A DEEP STATE OF HYPNOTISM BUT THE RESULT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THE PULSE RATE ROSE FROM SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE SENSATION REMEMBERED WAS THAT OF RIDING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR
2159-179156-0027 THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
2159-179156-0028 TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
2159-179156-0029 AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
2159-179156-0030 AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
2159-179156-0031 APPEARS TO SUMMON SIGMUND TO VALHALLA
2159-179156-0032 IT BECAME SLOW AND IRREGULAR AND VERY SMALL THE RESPIRATION DECREASED ALMOST TO GASPING THE FACE GREW PALE AND A COLD PERSPIRATION BROKE OUT READERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT
2159-179156-0033 WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
2159-179156-0034 AND CALL THE LETTERS AS I DIRECTED STIMULATION WAS IN THIS CASE IMPOSSIBLE AS I MADE HIM READ FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PAGES HE CALLING THE LETTERS AS SUGGESTED EACH TIME THEY OCCURRED THE EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHTENING
2159-179156-0035 AND CLAIRVOYANCE IF THE POWERS OF THE MIND ARE SO ENORMOUSLY INCREASED ALL THAT IS REQUIRED OF A VERY SENSITIVE AND EASILY HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS TO HYPNOTIZE HIM OR HERSELF WHEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO READ THOUGHTS
2159-179157-0000 AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
2159-179157-0001 THAT THEY HAVE ANY PECULIAR POWER IN THEMSELVES WHICH THEY EXERT OVER THEIR FELLOWS ONE OF THESE PROFESSIONALS GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN HIS BOOK OF WHAT HE CALLS THE WONDERFUL LOCK METHOD HE SAYS THAT
2159-179157-0002 THOUGH HE IS LOCKED UP IN A SEPARATE ROOM HE CAN MAKE THE PSYCHIC POWER WORK THROUGH THE WALLS ALL THAT HE DOES IS TO PUT HIS SUBJECTS IN THE WAY OF HYPNOTIZING THEMSELVES
2159-179157-0003 HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
2159-179157-0004 BUT OF COURSE IF THE HYPNOTIZER LOOKS STEADILY INTO THE EYES OF HIS SUBJECT AND THE SUBJECT LOOKS INTO HIS EYES THE STEADY GAZE ON A BRIGHT OBJECT WILL PRODUCE HYPNOTISM IN ONE QUITE AS READILY AS IN THE OTHER
2159-179157-0005 HYPNOTISM IS AN ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC FACT BUT THE CLAIM THAT THE HYPNOTIZER HAS ANY MYSTERIOUS PSYCHIC POWER IS THE INVARIABLE MARK OF THE CHARLATAN
2159-179157-0006 PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
2159-179157-0007 AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
2159-179157-0008 MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
2159-179157-0009 NAMELY THAT OF THE CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM WE MAY CONCEIVE HOW SUCH A PROFESSION MIGHT BECOME PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND HIGHLY USEFUL BUT AT PRESENT IT SEEMS AS IF ANY PERSON WHO WENT INTO IT
2159-179157-0010 HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
2159-179157-0011 LET US QUOTE DOCTOR COCKE'S EXPERIMENT IN HYPNOTIZING HIMSELF IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT A PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTIZER OR MAGNETIZER HAD HYPNOTIZED HIM BY TELLING HIM TO FIX HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND
2159-179157-0012 I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
2159-179157-0013 THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
2159-179157-0014 I FELT IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THERE WERE BEINGS ALL ABOUT ME BUT COULD NOT HEAR THEIR VOICES I FELT AS THOUGH EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY WAS FIXED AND RIGID
2159-179157-0015 THE ROAR IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER STILL AND I HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR REPORTS WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY THEN ABOVE THE DIN OF THE NOISE A MUSICAL CHORD I SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS CHORD I KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2159-179157-0016 SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
2159-179157-0017 HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF DREAMS BEAR A WONDERFUL LIKENESS TO DE QUINCEY'S DREAMS SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ENGLISH MAIL COACH DE PROFUNDIS AND THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM EATER
2159-179157-0018 ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
2159-179157-0019 ARE CAUSES WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND IN CONJUNCTION AND PRODUCE EFFECTS WHICH WE MAY REASONABLY EXPLAIN ON THE THEORY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION
2159-179157-0020 FOR INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF AN EXCITING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ARE VERY LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY MESMER'S OPERATIONS IN PARIS THE SUBJECTS BECOME HYSTERICAL AND ARE READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING
2159-179157-0021 BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
2159-179157-0022 IN FACT IT IS A SORT OF INTOXICATION THE SAME PHENOMENA ARE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE STRANGE RECORDS OF HISTORY THE WONDERFUL CURES AT LOURDES OF WHICH WE HAVE READ IN ZOLA'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME
2159-179157-0023 ARE NO DOUBT THE EFFECT OF HYPNOTIZATION BY THE PRIESTS SOME OF THE STRANGE MOVEMENTS OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES DURING THE CRUSADES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED EITHER ON THE THEORY OF HYPNOTIZATION OR OF CONTAGION
2159-179157-0024 AND POSSIBLY THESE TWO THINGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE MUCH THE SAME IN FACT ON NO OTHER GROUND CAN WE EXPLAIN THE SO CALLED CHILDREN'S CRUSADE IN WHICH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM GERMANY FROM ALL CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
2159-179157-0025 TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
2159-179157-0026 GAZING STEADILY AT A BED OF BRIGHT COALS OR A STREAM OF RUNNING WATER WILL INVARIABLY THROW A SENSITIVE SUBJECT INTO A HYPNOTIC SLEEP THAT WILL LAST SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL HOURS DOCTOR COCKE SAYS
2159-179157-0027 THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
2159-179157-0028 WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
2159-179157-0029 IS THAT OF THE MYSTIC SWEDENBORG WHO SAW SUCH STRANGE THINGS IN HIS VISIONS AND AT LAST CAME TO BELIEVE IN THEM AS REAL THE SAME EXPLANATION MAY BE GIVEN OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ORIENTAL PROPHETS
2159-179157-0030 FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
2159-179157-0031 THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
2159-179157-0032 AND HIS LANGUAGE WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SENSE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND A VERY INTELLIGENT LADY WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN PERSONATED THE PART VERY WELL DOCTOR COOKE SAYS OF HIMSELF
2159-179157-0033 I CAN HYPNOTIZE MYSELF TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I WILL BECOME WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AROUND ME AND A LONG INTERVAL OF TIME SAY FROM ONE HALF TO TWO HOURS WILL BE A COMPLETE BLANK
5456-62014-0000 THE WOMAN WHO MARRIED AN OWL BY ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON WHEN THE CHILDREN GOT HOME FROM THE NUTTING EXPEDITION AND HAD EATEN SUPPER THEY SAT AROUND DISCONTENTEDLY WISHING EVERY FEW MINUTES THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD RETURNED I WISH MAMMA WOULD COME BACK

5456-62043-0000 A BULLY BOAT AND A BRAG CAPTAIN A STORY OF STEAMBOAT LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI BY SOL SMITH DOES ANY ONE REMEMBER THE CARAVAN SHE WAS WHAT WOULD NOW BE CONSIDERED A SLOW BOAT THEN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN
5456-62043-0001 SHE WAS REGULARLY ADVERTISED AS THE FAST RUNNING ET CETERA HER REGULAR TRIPS FROM NEW ORLEANS TO NATCHEZ WERE USUALLY MADE IN FROM SIX TO EIGHT DAYS A TRIP MADE BY HER IN FIVE DAYS WAS CONSIDERED REMARKABLE
5456-62043-0002 A VOYAGE FROM NEW ORLEANS TO VICKSBURG AND BACK INCLUDING STOPPAGES GENERALLY ENTITLED THE OFFICERS AND CREW TO A MONTH'S WAGES WHETHER THE CARAVAN EVER ACHIEVED THE FEAT OF A VOYAGE TO THE FALLS LOUISVILLE I HAVE NEVER LEARNED IF SHE DID
5456-62043-0003 SHE MUST HAVE HAD A TIME OF IT IT WAS MY FATE TO TAKE PASSAGE IN THIS BOAT THE CAPTAIN WAS A GOOD NATURED EASY GOING MAN CAREFUL OF THE COMFORT OF HIS PASSENGERS AND EXCEEDINGLY FOND OF THE GAME OF BRAG WE HAD BEEN OUT A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE DAYS
5456-62043-0004 AND WE WERE IN HOPES OF SEEING THE BLUFFS OF NATCHEZ ON THE NEXT DAY OUR WOOD WAS GETTING LOW AND NIGHT COMING ON THE PILOT ON DUTY ABOVE THE OTHER PILOT HELD THREE ACES AT THE TIME AND WAS JUST CALLING OUT THE CAPTAIN WHO WENT IT STRONG ON THREE KINGS
5456-62043-0005 SENT DOWN WORD THAT THE MATE HAD REPORTED THE STOCK OF WOOD REDUCED TO HALF A CORD THE WORTHY CAPTAIN EXCUSED HIMSELF TO THE PILOT WHOSE WATCH WAS BELOW AND THE TWO PASSENGERS WHO MADE UP THE PARTY AND HURRIED TO THE DECK
5456-62043-0006 WHICH HE SAID WAS SITUATED RIGHT ROUND YONDER POINT BUT MUTTERED THE CAPTAIN I DON'T MUCH LIKE TO TAKE WOOD OF THE YELLOW FACED OLD SCOUNDREL WHO OWNS IT HE ALWAYS CHARGES A QUARTER OF A DOLLAR MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE HOWEVER THERE'S NO OTHER CHANCE
5456-62043-0007 AND IN A LITTLE LESS THAN AN HOUR WHEN OUR FUEL WAS ABOUT GIVING OUT WE MADE THE POINT AND OUR CABLES WERE OUT AND FASTENED TO TREES ALONGSIDE OF A GOOD SIZED WOOD PILE HALLO COLONEL HOW D'YE SELL YOUR WOOD THIS TIME A YELLOW FACED OLD GENTLEMAN
5456-62043-0008 WITH A TWO WEEKS BEARD STRINGS OVER HIS SHOULDERS HOLDING UP TO HIS ARMPITS A PAIR OF COPPERAS COLORED LINSEY WOOLSEY PANTS THE LEGS OF WHICH REACHED A VERY LITTLE BELOW THE KNEE SHOES WITHOUT STOCKINGS A FADED BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN BLACK
5456-62043-0009 AND A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH CASTING A GLANCE AT THE EMPTY GUARDS OF OUR BOAT AND UTTERING A GRUNT AS HE ROSE FROM FASTENING OUR SPRING LINE ANSWERED WHY CAPTING WE MUST CHARGE YOU THREE AND A QUARTER THIS TIME THE D L REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
5456-62043-0010 WHAT'S THE ODD QUARTER FOR I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOU ONLY CHARGED ME THREE AS I WENT DOWN WHY CAPTAING DRAWLED OUT THE WOOD MERCHANT WITH A SORT OF LEER ON HIS YELLOW COUNTENANCE WHICH CLEARLY INDICATED THAT HIS WOOD WAS AS GOOD AS SOLD
5456-62043-0011 WOOD'S RIZ SINCE YOU WENT DOWN TWO WEEKS AGO BESIDES YOU ARE AWAR THAT YOU VERY SELDOM STOP GOING DOWN
5456-62043-0012 AND THERE'S NO OTHER WOODYARD FOR NINE MILES AHEAD AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE NEARLY OUT OF FOOEL WHY WELL WELL INTERRUPTED THE CAPTAIN WE'LL TAKE A FEW CORDS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HE RETURNED TO HIS GAME OF BRAG
5456-62043-0013 IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WE FELT THE CARAVAN COMMENCE PADDLING AGAIN SUPPER WAS OVER
5456-62043-0014 SITUATED ALONGSIDE AND OVERLOOKING THE BRAG TABLE WHERE THE CAPTAIN WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED HAVING NOW THE OTHER PILOT AS HIS PRINCIPAL OPPONENT WE JOGGED ON QUIETLY AND SEEMED TO BE GOING AT A GOOD RATE
5456-62043-0015 HOW DOES THAT WOOD BURN INQUIRED THE CAPTAIN OF THE MATE WHO WAS LOOKING ON AT THE GAME TISN'T OF MUCH ACCOUNT I RECKON ANSWERED THE MATE IT'S COTTONWOOD AND MOST OF IT GREEN AT THAT WELL THOMPSON THREE ACES AGAIN STRANGER
5456-62043-0016 THOMPSON I SAY WE'D BETTER TAKE THREE OR FOUR CORDS AT THE NEXT WOODYARD IT CAN'T BE MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM HERE TWO ACES AND A BRAGGER WITH THE AGE
5456-62043-0017 THE GAME WENT ON AND THE PADDLES KEPT MOVING AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IT WAS REPORTED TO THE CAPTAIN THAT WE WERE NEARING THE WOODYARD THE LIGHT BEING DISTINCTLY SEEN BY THE PILOT ON DUTY HEAD HER IN SHORE THEN AND TAKE IN SIX CORDS IF IT'S GOOD SEE TO IT THOMPSON
5456-62043-0018 I CAN'T VERY WELL LEAVE THE GAME NOW IT'S GETTING RIGHT WARM THIS PILOT'S BEATING US ALL TO SMASH THE WOODING COMPLETED WE PADDLED ON AGAIN THE CAPTAIN SEEMED SOMEWHAT VEXED WHEN THE MATE INFORMED HIM THAT THE PRICE WAS THE SAME AS AT THE LAST WOODYARD
5456-62043-0019 THREE AND A QUARTER BUT SOON AGAIN BECAME INTERESTED IN THE GAME FROM MY UPPER BERTH THERE WERE NO STATE ROOMS THEN I COULD OBSERVE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE PLAYERS
5456-62043-0020 THE LATTER PERSONAGES TOOK IT TURN AND TURN ABOUT STEERING AND PLAYING BRAG ONE OF THEM ALMOST INVARIABLY WINNING WHILE THE TWO PASSENGERS MERELY WENT THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF DEALING CUTTING AND PAYING UP THEIR ANTIES THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE GAME
5456-62043-0021 AND THEY DID LEARN IT ONCE IN A WHILE INDEED SEEING THEY HAD TWO ACES AND A BRAGGER THEY WOULD VENTURE A BET OF FIVE OR TEN DOLLARS BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS COMPELLED TO BACK OUT BEFORE THE TREMENDOUS BRAGGING OF THE CAPTAIN OR PILOT
5456-62043-0022 OR IF THEY DID VENTURE TO CALL OUT ON TWO BULLITS AND A BRAGGER THEY HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO FIND ONE OF THE OFFICERS HAD THE SAME KIND OF A HAND AND WERE MORE VENERABLE STILL WITH ALL THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY CONTINUED PLAYING
5456-62043-0023 THEY WANTED TO LEARN THE GAME AT TWO O'CLOCK THE CAPTAIN ASKED THE MATE HOW WE WERE GETTING ON OH PRETTY GLIBLY SIR REPLIED THE MATE WE CAN SCARCELY TELL WHAT HEADWAY WE ARE MAKING FOR WE ARE OBLIGED TO KEEP THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND THERE IS THE SHADOW OF A FOG RISING
5456-62043-0024 THIS WOOD SEEMS RATHER BETTER THAN THAT WE TOOK IN AT YELLOW FACE'S BUT WE'RE NEARLY OUT AGAIN AND MUST BE LOOKING OUT FOR MORE I SAW A LIGHT JUST AHEAD ON THE RIGHT SHALL WE HAIL YES YES REPLIED THE CAPTAIN RING THE BELL AND ASK EM WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD UP HERE I'VE GOT YOU AGAIN
5456-62043-0025 I HEARD THE BELL AND THE PILOT'S HAIL WHAT'S YOUR PRICE FOR WOOD A YOUTHFUL VOICE ON THE SHORE ANSWERED THREE AND A QUARTER D NET EJACULATED THE CAPTAIN
5456-62043-0026 THE STRANGERS SUFFERING SOME AT THE SAME TIME THREE AND A QUARTER AGAIN ARE WE NEVER TO GET TO A CHEAPER COUNTRY DEAL SIR IF YOU PLEASE BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME THE OTHER PILOT'S VOICE WAS AGAIN HEARD ON DECK HOW MUCH HAVE YOU ONLY ABOUT TEN CORDS SIR
5456-62043-0027 WAS THE REPLY OF THE YOUTHFUL SALESMAN THE CAPTAIN HERE TOLD THOMPSON TO TAKE SIX CORDS WHICH WOULD LAST TILL DAYLIGHT AND AGAIN TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE GAME THE PILOTS HERE CHANGED PLACES WHEN DID THEY SLEEP WOOD TAKEN IN
5456-62043-0028 THE CARAVAN AGAIN TOOK HER PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM PADDLING ON AS USUAL DAY AT LENGTH DAWNED THE BRAG PARTY BROKE UP AND SETTLEMENTS WERE BEING MADE DURING WHICH OPERATION
5456-62043-0029 THE CAPTAIN'S BRAGGING PROPENSITIES WERE EXERCISED IN CRACKING UP THE SPEED OF HIS BOAT WHICH BY HIS RECKONING
5456-62043-0030 IT APPEARS THE TWO PASSENGERS IN THEIR FIRST LESSON HAD INCIDENTALLY LOST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS THE CAPTAIN AS HE ROSE TO SEE ABOUT TAKING IN SOME GOOD WOOD WHICH HE FELT SURE OF OBTAINING NOW THAT HE HAD GOT ABOVE THE LEVEL COUNTRY WINKED AT HIS OPPONENT
5456-62043-0031 THE PILOT WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN ON VERY BAD TERMS DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE GAME AND SAID IN AN UNDERTONE FORTY APIECE FOR YOU AND I AND JAMES THE OTHER PILOT IS NOT BAD FOR ONE NIGHT I HAD RISEN AND WENT OUT WITH THE CAPTAIN TO ENJOY A VIEW OF THE BLUFFS
5456-62043-0032 THERE WAS JUST FOG ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE VISION TAKING IN MORE THAN SIXTY YARDS SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN MY EXPECTATION WE WERE NEARING THE SHORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING FOR WOOD THE BANKS BEING INVISIBLE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER THERE IT IS EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN STOP HER
5456-62043-0033 AND THE CAPTAIN HAILED HALLO THE WOODYARD HALLO YOURSELF ANSWERED A SQUEAKING FEMALE VOICE WHICH CAME FROM A WOMAN WITH A PETTICOAT OVER HER SHOULDERS IN PLACE OF A SHAWL WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD
5456-62043-0034 I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THE PRICE BY THIS TIME ANSWERED THE OLD LADY IN THE PETTICOAT
5456-62043-0035 AND NOW YOU KNOW IT THREE AND THE D L BROKE IN THE CAPTAIN WHAT HAVE YOU RAISED ON YOUR WOOD TOO I'LL GIVE YOU THREE AND NOT A CENT MORE WELL REPLIED THE PETTICOAT HERE COMES THE OLD MAN HE'LL TALK TO YOU AND SURE ENOUGH
5456-62043-0036 OUT CREPT FROM THE COTTAGE THE VERITABLE FADED HAT COPPERAS COLORED PANTS YELLOW COUNTENANCE AND TWO WEEKS BEARD WE HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE

1553-140048-0000 THEY DID NOT ACCOMPANY EACH OTHER TO THE DOORS OF THEIR CHOSEN VICTIMS FEELING SURE THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD NOT APPROACH THE SUBJECT SERIOUSLY BUT THEY PARTED AT THE GATE OF EACH HOUSE THE ONE HOLDING THE HORSE WHILE THE OTHER TOOK THE SOAP SAMPLES
1553-140048-0001 AND INTERVIEWED ANY ONE WHO SEEMED OF A COMING ON DISPOSITION EMMA JANE HAD DISPOSED OF THREE SINGLE CAKES REBECCA OF THREE SMALL BOXES FOR A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC WAS CLEARLY DEFINED AT THE START
